1,NPD,"New rule: No asking for diagnosis, period.","Hey everyone - we had a poll of the subscribers and the overwhelming results were that people are sick of posts asking for diagnosis (""Do I sound like I have NPD"" type thing). 

Posts asking for a diagnosis of oneself or a 3rd party will be locked and removed. Repeat violations will result in a ban. 

Please remember this is a support community for anyone with NPD or narcissistic traits. If you think this applies to you, then you are welcome to post here - a formal diagnosis is not needed. 

If you want more information about NPD or diagnostic criteria, please check out the relevant information from the DSM V: https://www.theravive.com/therapedia/narcissistic-personality-disorder-dsm--5-301.81-(f60.81) or consult with an appropriately licensed counselor or doctor.

If you see someone asking for a diagnosis or posting about someone else's narcissism:

1. Report the post using the report button
2. Tag me on the post with /u/Phteven_j 
3. DO NOT ENGAGE with the poster 

It's hard enough dealing with a debilitating disorder without idiots mucking up the support community, so please help us keep things friendly and supportive.

7,NPD,You are a human being,"I used to be one of those people who called everyone a narcissist (ha, it was me all along!) and it doesn‚Äôt matter how I got here. I‚Äôve done some really awful things and hurt a lot of people. Sometimes I hate myself so much I can‚Äôt function but I believe a part of me is trying to be better, especially after becoming self-aware. People in this world are really cruel about personality disorders, self-proclaimed mental health advocates, yet when it comes to the complexities of narcissism - there is only labels of abusive, terrible people. Yet, many of us experienced enough abuse or trauma to get here. Not every situation is a simple victim and villain story and there is a grey area we often miss.

Whatever you have done, and you may or may not feel bad about it depending on yourself, you are a human being who exists and you are not all bad. If you are trying, I applaud you, validate you and am rooting for you to be better, whatever that means for you. Happy new year to all of you.",1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
8,NPD,Anyone is going trough schema therapy?,"Lets make it short and sweet,

first i‚Äôm cool as fuck

second I went to therapy two years ago and been diagnosed with NPD. I stopped going for multiple reasons that i wont get into but also because she pushed me to. 

I restarted with a new therapist and shes making me read about schema therapy mainly about the schema that applies to me. For now she says I have an imperfection schema and that is what makes me : attack, avoid or submit to other people. For me it is mainly attacks and I rarely submit to the threat. I just started (3 session so far) but she suspect other schema as well.

I am curious, anyone else is going trough the same as me? What schema applies to you? 

Also do you have giant difficulty opening up about your youth? Every time she asks me I freeze and I get in distress and I only say a few things here and there

Having a lover 'cause he is unstable but also having a girlfriend 'cause she let me to have a comfortable life! Yes, I love this but it is EXHAUSTING!

It is EXHAUSTING being always perfect...especially 'cause I was a loser during my school's ages.

It is EXHAUSTING pretend to be always ok...EXHAUSTING being the bad person during the discussion 'cause my ego will never let me to show my weak part. EXHAUSTING!

This isn‚Äôt my NPD talking and while he is a really great guy‚Ä¶it‚Äôs no secret that looks-wise I am ‚Äòout of his league‚Äô (said multiple times by various people to my face). Ok fine whatever. 

At first because even he felt this way‚Ä¶he would compliment me constantly. He would constantly stare and tell me how pretty I was. How amazing. And I ate that shit up. I thought hey maybe this is really it for me. He keeps my ego high and I do the same for him in a way (he loves showing me off) and I am a nice person overall despite my NPD.

However, slowly things are starting to change as they normally do past the first few months of dating. He‚Äôs not complimenting me as much as it‚Äôs becoming more ‚Äònormal‚Äô that he has me. And i find myself fishing more and more for those compliments. Then i feel embarrassed and angry that he‚Äôs even putting me in this position so I want to push him away and make him ‚Äòrealize what he has‚Äô all over again.

My partner of 3 years hasn't always been the most open or social individual, for examples we never had a proper trip because he hates travelling, gifts/surprises are mostly mine (I gave him his christmas present but haven't got mine yet) even if he really doesn't care about these things so he wouldn't mind if I didn't get him anything.He's quite apathetic and most of the things we might have done together I ended up doing on my own. He's very upset every time I make him notice how wrong everything is and how hurtful it can be for me, but he just can't seem to understand, he says he's never asked me to be different or change, so I just should accept that he's like this. It's still beyond me and not getting the attention (that I think I deserve) makes me cry first, then rage, even if I avoid raging at him. But I'm super miserable and unhappy because of this.

26,NPD,Grieving the version of myself I had in my head‚Ä¶ I feel broken,"Until recently, I sincerely described myself as a kind, caring, and empathetic person. I‚Äôm a special education teacher and did caregiving jobs through college. I‚Äôve always had issues with lying, identity, and self-esteem, but I had an idea in my head that I was handling it well enough and my kindness covered up those things.  

My grandma has NPD and gave my sister and I crippling insecurities. My resentment towards my grandma combined with NPD portrayal on social media AND the version of myself I had in my head, I NEVER in a million years would‚Äôve guessed I had NPD as well. But here I am. 

I feel so broken. I‚Äôm so embarrassed by my behavior all these years now that I‚Äôm looking at certain events with self-awareness. I always knew deep down I was being a huge asshole and manipulating people. I felt so much shame but was always somehow able to make myself the victim and excuse all of my behavior. 

This is the first time in my life I‚Äôm being this honest with myself. This is probably stupidly dramatic to say, but I feel like I‚Äôm grieving the old version of myself. In reality, I haven‚Äôt changed at all from an outsiders perspective and will hopefully become more genuinely kind with treatment, but the idea I had of myself is destroyed and I hate myself.
