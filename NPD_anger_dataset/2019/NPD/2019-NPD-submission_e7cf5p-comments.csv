f9y6vir,t3_e7cf5p,"I have BPD, and in the BPD community, so many people put all the blame on Narcissistic abuse. I can somewhat understand it from a kids perspective, because anyone with a Cluster B disorder that was undiagnosed who was raising children would probably do a bit of damage. 

However... the people who talk about the NPD abuse from their partner... I think that's kind of silly because I was an absolute monster to my partner, who had Narcissistic traits. I'm sure I dished out just as much as he did, and I *did* have a bit of insight. Enough that I should have known better. But it was easier to play the victim, so I did. It's something my ex always talked about, that I played the victim. I abused him just as much, and I broke him more in the end than he ever did to me. It's taken hindsight and much more insight to see that. I blamed him for everything, when I was just as much at fault and just as toxic.",t3_e7cf5p
fa13ma4,t3_e7cf5p,"Some people need and deserve a support group. Some people really truly are victims, but that being said even those people are taking zero responsibility for their part in the relationship. No one can abuse you if you leave. 

I don’t know why there’s all those “I have borderline personality disorder and I’m not a bad person or abusive” memes why wouldn’t narcissist be the same? Nothing in the DSM says narcissist are abusive, so using it to describe any abusive person is kind of silly. It makes a joke out of the word narcissist. 

Also after knowing a few people, who completely exaggerated being abused, are “victims” despite hitting the other person FIRST because “narcissist make you act out of character” and take zero responsibility for anything and blame their ex for EVERYTHING, it’s just like..... makes a lot of those people hard to believe. I think a lot of them exaggerate certain things that they feed to each other and talk each other’s bullshit up. It’s really sad actually, that they seem so delusional THEY’RE the ones with the personality disorder.  I’m only speaking on the people I actually know who did that, but it makes it seriously hard to believe any of those people.

faarq6q,t1_f9zg8sf,"> I'm still scared to have children because I would probably fuck them up

Every parent fucks their kid up a little. I was raised by an NPD dad, and he did fuck me up--precisely because he never questioned himself, and any questioning of his actions was verboten. Self-awareness and consideration are important when parenting.

I will also say that r/raisedbynarcissists is a bit of a double edged community. On the one hand, I spent a lot of time on it when I was starting to realize how absolutely fucked up my upbringing was and how badly it screwed me up. On the other hand--and the sub is criticized by plenty on reddit for this--while it is good to not question peoples experience with abuse, a lot of posters on there just seem like angry teenagers with perfectly reasonable parents, or people who had parents who weren't perfect but don't really seem that abusive either.

And no, not every narcissist was raised by a cluster b or abusive parent. That’s not true. Cluster b and abusive parents do have a greater chance of raising a mentally ill child, that i can agree with, but not in all cases does that happen. Do *not* tell me how and what I feel about that toxic space, you don’t know me and I will not let you put words in my mouth. I feel demonized because they talk as if *all* narcissists are abusive, terrible people. They constantly interchange it with “abusive person” and the way they talk out against us is absolutely disgusting. What I’m saying is they use the word narcissist way too lightly and almost always in the wrong context, so we get associated with something that even isn’t us and it’s frustrating because it puts us in bad light. Also I have *never* seen a place where people vent about having a mentally ill parent other than with cluster b’s. Even if they are out there they certainly don’t go around saying they hate their parents or wish they were dead like r/rbn. They can at least recognize that their parents mental illness wasn’t trying to hurt them in any way. Thats because those other disorders are far from stigmatized compared to cluster b’s, they’re the sad victims of mental illness and were just seen as the malignant abusers r/rbn says we are. FLEAS is a bullshit and highly insulting term, you’re implying that once again narcissism is inherently a terrible thing let alone comparing it to a vampiric arachnid. Absolutely despicable. None of you *need* a space to vent, what you need is therapy. You need professional help. Bitching about it online will get you absolutely nowhere in life, and it only creates more toxic atmospheres than there needs to be. You didn’t help shit.",t3_e7cf5p
f9yc70f,t1_f9ya6pg,"I think NPD and BPD make the perfect toxic match, honestly. You want to be put on the pedestal, we want to put you there. You want constant adoration, we want to give it to you. Also, I think Borderlines in general, when we are in positive states are usually pretty nice and easy to get along with and fun and we have the same impulsiveness that you do, so I think that we get a lot off on doing a lot of the same things, like being adventurous. Narcissists are also awesome to be around when they are in a positive mood. We have the same impulsivity, so I bet together, a couple with NPD and BPD would do a lot of awesome fun things together. The good times *would* be hella good. My ex and I's good times were so fucking good that it completely blocked out the bad shit. None of it mattered. I'm sure you guys want someone who will never leave just as much as we do. I dunno if NPD has Fear of Abandonment, but my ex, I'm pretty sure he'll never enter into another relationship because it's too tedious for him and I doubt that he will want to open himself up like that to someone else, because of how difficult it honestly is. I think that Borderlines are usually extremely empathetic, so while we are with you, we can totally understand why you are the way you are. We totally love you for you. But someone was talking about the object permanence thing the other day? It might have been you? About how when someone leaves our site, we stop caring about them as much. Well, I think that when a Borderline separates from their Narcissist, we lose that same level of love and caring and then we can vilify you and leave you that way. No back and forth, you just stay a villain. Also, Borderlines are perfectly happy being miserable. It's where we are most comfortable. We hate being miserable, but will do nothing to change it because we feel like we deserve it, and some Narcissists have no problem making us feel like that. It's honestly mutually beneficial when we aren't trying to get better. When we aren't putting the work in and perfectly happy with who we are, it's probably the most perfect relationship to be in.

She wasn’t allowed to talk to me because I sent her a DV victim poster I saw at our college, and he’s pushed her out a moving vehicle. The list goes on. 

I’ve also watched her break his windows out with a baseball bat, go back to him continuously, lied to cops about him breaking in the house, and drive around for hours looking for a dude that isn’t shit. 

She’s since left him. Do you know what she doesn’t do? Parade around on facebook and Reddit how much of a victim or survivor she is. She also doesn’t exaggerate these mysterious bogeyman like symptoms. That’s ACTUALLY a relationship that will give you PTSD but instead of dwelling and being a victim she’s thriving and happy now.

f9yfx7f,t1_f9yc70f,"i totally agree with that, borderlines tendency to be empathetic works very well with the narcissist, because oftentimes we feel very misunderstood and like nobody ever gets us unless they’re equal to us. being empathetic shows that you actually know what i’m feeling and understand, and that really does help us see you at an equal level, and actually makes it harder to devalue. borderlines’ need to give validation and be the one to attach themselves also makes the relationship closer i think, because supply is so effortless and it’s actually given willingly. with that, manipulation or manipulative behavior just isn’t necessary to get the attention we want, because it’s given so freely. the dynamic just works really well and i think if both parties work on not making eachother feel drained and have coping skills in place that the relationship can definitely be a great one. i like to think of us as normal until we get into a bad mood or someone goes against our pride, like when we’re in a good headspace we’re actually pretty great to be around and awesome friends. it’s only when people seem to challenge or invalidate us that we get upset, and when we do it’s not the same type of upset as a normal person. basically what i mean is that if you stay on a narcs good side, you’ll get the benefits, because those that see us as perfect (or at least in high standing) we also tend to see them that way as well, it’s a way of projecting. love us, we love you, hate us, we hate you. we just kind of match the vibe. object permanence also plays a big part in that though, because if we start to snowball our thoughts about you and you aren’t there to either confirm or deny whatever bad thing we think you do then we start the devaluation process. as for fear of abandonment, i think a lot of us secretly do have it but don’t like to admit it. personally i probably do a little bit but i try to ignore it most of the time unless it’s a possible situation. but yeah for a successful BPD/NPD relationship to happen i think they just need to be around each other a lot, keep up with validation and reassurance of each other, and find a good way to not fall into those thoughts that come with the lack of object permanency when apart. i think with those it can work extremely efficiently.",t3_e7cf5p

Not because I wanted to, but because I was very unaware of all my toxic actions and I put all the blame on him. He had blame, there is no doubt. He destroyed me. But I also destroyed him. 

The abuse, even though he is a Narcissist, and even though he was also at fault, was real to him. It still hurt him. In that situation, yeah, both of us *are* in the wrong. 

You'll note that OP also said that they completely understand that children of NPD parents are justified in how they feel.

OP also isn't downplaying any abuse they have dished out. They are just saying they have pain too, and they'd like to be able to talk about it in the appropriate forum where others do.

Cluster B PDs are known for triggering themselves to feel like shit on purpose.

f9yl45r,t1_f9yfx7f,"Haaa! It's funny you say that, because lately I have been saying all us with PD's are all normal, regular people, we just wear a veil of bias, because of our experiences in life. Our experiences weren't normal, so sometimes our behavior or outlook isn't normal. It makes sense. We had bad examples set for us in life. However, with insight, we can slowly start to overwrite all of that. It just takes a really, really long time, because adults learn slower than children do. Then we can just be normal people with an extra set of tools that most people don't get.

It's also interesting that you say we just don't want to feel challenged or invalidated. I think that is 100% accurate. For instance, for me, when I am being delusional, a lot of times I will say, ""This is what I am thinking, I know it's delusional."" And then my partner starts talking about why it's delusional. Trying to break down the delusion, which holy shit just makes it so much worse. Like, so much worse. He figured out this week that if he doesn't do that, and he just listened to me, lets me vent, and asks a few probing questions, that he can fix me in that moment. It's so simple. I just need to feel heard and validated. We are all very intelligent. A lot of times we can tell something isn't right with us, even without a diagnosis. So, to have someone further point out something about one of my symptoms just makes us feel completely unheard.

BPD folks do the same exact thing. See, we always act like we are sweet and innocent victims, but we do that shit too. If they aren't there to fix the problem, it reinforces whatever shitty delusion we have about them. Also, sometimes if I have a delusion surrounding my partner and I don't talk to him about it, the delusion being reinforced snowballs. Because he has no idea he is doing stuff to reinforce it, but I am collecting data the whole time and absolutely vilifying him. Creating a story and blowing it out of proportion in my head, when it was just that, a story. A story that my dumbass made up. Lol.

I think a Narcissists Fear of Abandonment, if it's anything like what my ex described, is that you wind up spending a very long period of time with someone, you get to know them, you put all the effort in, you didn't leave even though they were annoying and unhealthy and you don't deserve to put up with that, they put the effort in also and do have empathy toward you, and do validate you and give you reassurance, they also didn't leave for an extended period of time so you have some level of trust with them... but you know that if they/you do leave, you sure as shit don't want to put yourself though that again. It sounds kind of like self-preservation, in a way. Like, if this doesn't work out, I'm not gonna even bother again. Too much work, too tedious. And what was the point? It didn't work out anyways.

f9ysedf,t1_f9yl45r,"the narc fear of abandonment is most definitely about self preservation, that’s 100% it. it’s not so much the fear of someone leaving, it’s the fear of someone leaving and then having to go through it all over again. it’s the assumption that if this situation didn’t work out, then why will it work out next time? we think it won’t work and we don’t bother trying, so that we don’t have to go through that hurt again. 

it’s all about being left with your own thoughts. if there’s room to speculate then you will speculate, but if you can communicate and leave no room to second guess then it’s a lot easier to make healthy connections and keep them.

i think it’s the frustration from having been told what we already know. when people try to act like experts on your behavior it’s almost like challenging your intelligence on your own sense of self, which makes them seem pretentious as hell. it just comes off as annoying when they try to tell you how you’re feeling when you’re trying to explain it, which in turn makes it seem like they weren’t listening to you in the first place, and we feel unheard like you said.

and with the personality disorders being normal people with differently shaped world views i totally agree, though it really depends on background. sometimes different experiences don’t lead to different outlooks and behaviors, like personally my childhood was pretty normal but i’ve been like this ever since i could think, so sometimes it’s just a born thing. i definitely do think that most behaviors can be overcome or at least improved, but not all symptoms can be, not at this point in time anyway. i don’t think we’ll be perfectly normal like everyone else completely, but i definitely do think that by improving we can be close to it, along with the added skills we have.",t3_e7cf5p

fa0uusx,t1_f9ykkq3,"Narcissists lacking empathy is a misconception. Narcissists are very capable of empathy, and if anything, have stunted empathy. But empathy can be trained, so.

Usually when people lack empathy, it's because the part of their brain that controls empathy is underdeveloped, and/or the people who raised them set very poor examples. They aren't un-empathetic because they are assholes or because they want to be. It's because they never learned it, or because the structure of their brain.

OP isn't saying your abuse wasn't real. Isn't saying that it was right or that you deserved. I'm sure if you asked, OP would even tell you that they were sorry that you went through what you did, because... they do understand. Because they do have empathy.

Right now, you are lacking empathy to OP because your life experiences are making it very difficult to see the bigger picture. Because you lack empathy toward OP, you are abusing them. It's a continuous cycle that we need to stop. We need to help each other get better. Not point fingers and hold each other back.

Also, important to note, a lot of Narcissists wind up with other Cluster Bs, and then abuse them. and we abuse them right back. You're right, our parents do set the example for what we find acceptable later in life. You have to understand, OP has probably had the same hardship with finding a healthy companion as you have.

Sometimes we do things to hurt people we love because we can't see how toxic our behavior is. He and I both did that to each other, and then maybe it got to a point where we were both so hurt, we did it out of resentment even. 

You are exactly right. We already know we are batshit. Lol. We aren't trying to dispute that? In fact... we are pointing it out even more! Shit, just listen. Lol. And I think it also makes me mad, because who could presume to know more about my own disorder than me? Especially now a days. Who are you to tell me what I am feeling, and how much control I should have over it. Fuck off. You don't have a PD, and you are trying to tell me how to live my life with a PD? How could we even take someone like that serious? 

That is really interesting to me. I'd be interested to see if I could still figure out how you developed your symptoms though. ;) Lol. I had a person the other day with ASPD who told me literally the same exact thing, but after they talked to me, they were like, yeah, okay, it makes sense why I have it. I love doing that for people, because I feel like it almost gives us a form of closure. 

Symptoms are survival mechanism. I don't necessarily think all of them need to be overcome, just changed so they are no longer unhealthy. Symptoms are usually a tool to survive in our environments, and when our environment changes, then they obviously also need to change. But you and I both know that's very hard. I say usually to survive, because you seem to be an exception. lol. But it would be interesting to figure out how you did develop them.

i don’t take people like that seriously either, if someone isn’t me then they’ll never know how i actually feel or see things so it’s just not worth it to explain to them.

Perhaps you should stop assuming you know everything about NPD, and maybe that would help you cultivate a little compassion.

Even though you are taking the steps to get better, no one believes you and they underestimate you. 

There comes a point, no matter who you are, or what you are suffering from, when people treat you like you can’t change and that you are defined by your disorder, you’re gonna get a bad reaction out of that person. I am Borderline and when my partner said I couldn’t and would never change, I’d lose my shit. It was the most offensive thing to say. How do you know? How do you know what another person is capable of? It sucks really bad when you are trying and no one sees that. It would make a normal person upset and sad, not to mention someone with a disorder. 

Also, please understand that when people ARE trying to get better, and someone tells us that we can’t, or what we are doing is pointless, or they don’t believe us... that takes all the progress we made to get to that point, where we really are getting better, and takes us back to square one.

fa0sbb7,t1_fa0ioc1,"While we're talking, I'd like to say that I have encountered thoughts similar to the ones which you are having about all these support subreddits. 

I have a friend who has BPD. She is an extremely thoughtful, self-disciplined and empathetic person, and so she takes great care not to let her condition cause her to hurt other people. She once talked to me about how much she hated /r/BPDlovedones  ; she felt that it was an awful, toxic place where people acted like BPD-sufferers were all inherently evil monsters. She complained that the subreddit banned people with BPD from commenting or participating; this seemed to her a ridiculous and stupid thing, as it meant it was impossible for her to go in there and point out that not all people with BPD are monsters, and that many people there had very inaccurate ideas of what BPD is. 

I was struck by her opinion, and it took me a while to work out what I thought about it. But the conclusion I reached is the same conclusion I want to share with you. /r/BPDlovedones and other similar support subreddits are, at the end of the day, places where people who have experienced certain kinds of abuse can find support - support which is almost impossible to find in the outside world. Crucially, these subreddits are *not* places for medical investigation of psychological disorders, and they are *not* places for people with BPD or NPD to talk about their own problems. As you know, there are already subreddits for BPD and NPD people to do that.

Yes, it can be grotesque for someone with BPD to look at the other support subreddits and see people talking about BPD-sufferers as if they are evil and inhuman. But it would be foolish to feel that way without bearing in mind that the primary function of those subreddits is to help people who frequently feel totally isolated and unable to understand or communicate about the abuse they are suffering. If you were to talk to someone from those subreddits in real life, the majority of them would have broad-minded, sympathetic opinions about people suffering from NPD or BPD. But within the subreddits, the priority is helping people - not preventing NPD/BPD people from having their feelings hurt.

fa43k7b,t1_fa3uni0,"So, I am Borderline, like I have said a zillion times. Badge of honor. I can't tell you how many times I told people I was trying, maybe even kind of thought I was, wasn't, and was toxic to all the people around me. It is only after gaining insight, and actually trying, that I know how different it feels. And that makes me feel like shit, because I know the wake of destruction I left behind. I destroyed my Narcissistic partner in the end more than he ever could have done to me. And I justified it because I told myself because I figured he put me through hell. He did, it wasn't wrong that I left, but the way I did it was terrible. It was selfish. 

You don't have to excuse the behavior of OP, and I'm not really asking for that. I more just want people to understand that we are the way we are for a reason. And sometimes, we pretend we are changing when we aren't. There might have been some people in your life who didn't see the point in getting help, but that's not all Narcissists. And it really sucks for the ones who are trying, who get vilified. I wouldn't want to change my behavior either if all it got me was people calling me a liar and saying I'd never change. That kind of behavior makes all of us give up on society because we don't feel like we have a place. We don't fit in even when we are actively trying to control our behaviors, so why would we ever? 

I promise all people who suffer from PDs are normal people, who have normal worries, and wants, and things that they don't want to happen, and who just want acceptance and validation. People who constantly feel invalidated are a lot more angry and spiteful. 

I have tried to get to know everyone who has been willing to in this group, and they have all treated me with respect because I treat them with respect. I never let their diagnosis bias my opinion of them, because it really isn't a good indicator of what type of person someone is. We are all on different paths to healing, and some of us are way farther away than others.

The only way we can help people get better is to be accepting. Not using their diagnosis as an excuse for behavior, but open to the idea that they could change. It makes the world feel a lot more optimistic. And when you treat people like that, optimistically, they sometimes surprise you.",t3_e7cf5p
f9yx8ug,t1_f9yvsqr,you’re ignorant! if you’re just gonna keep insulting a group of people that have no control over their disorder or behaviors then just stop :),t3_e7cf5p
f9yxfcm,t1_f9yvsqr,"also this still isn’t your place. this isn’t your support group. this is for us, to talk about our problems, beliefs, and triggers. this is OUR place. you are not welcome here.",t3_e7cf5p

fa12ykv,t1_fa0xy9u,"Your point of view is reasonable. On one level, it is entirely innocent and positive to explain to people that they are using harmful stereotypes. However, I think it is justifiable that such intervention on those subreddits is unwelcome, for two reasons:

1) When one spends years of one's life being abused by people with BPD or NPD, one of the worst things that happens is that one is made to feel ignorant and stupid, and that one's very experience of life is not valid. When people trying to break out of that abuse go to those subreddits for support but find someone there criticising (and therefore, to some extent, *invalidating*) their perspective, it feels just like the gaslighting which they have been experiencing for years.

2) At the end of the day, those support subreddits are not about NPD or BPD or whatever else. They are about the people who come there for help. It is therefore ultimately irrelevant whether or not people operate with a sophisticated understanding or what NPD or BPD are.

One of the most important things to remember about NPD, BPD, and the Cluster B personality disorders in general, is that they are very poorly understood. Most doctors would struggle to recognise them, and most experts, when pressed, would admit that very few people tick all the boxes of any single condition. Seeking to develop and clarify our understanding of these horrible disorders is a very important thing, but it should not be the responsibility of people in the support subreddits we're talking about. They are not psychologists; they are terrified, lonely, confused people who are just beginning to realise that something awful has happened to them, and they are seeking support. 

Yes, sometimes people will use the word 'narcissist' far too loosely, and they might often *seem* to dehumanise or pathologise abusers. But this is an area of human experience where there is no rulebook. It is incredibly difficult to untangle the horrid mess which life becomes after such experiences, and so sometimes it is necessary to use crude tools.

As someone with NPD, it is understandable that it makes you feel awful when it seems to you that there is a large movement in which 'narcissist' is becoming a label which means 'bad person'. And you are justified in feeling that way. However, support subreddits for victims of abuse are not the place for you to push back against that movement.",t3_e7cf5p
f9yy1ot,t1_f9yx8ug,"When was it that I insulted anyone? I said exactly what you just said, in other words:  this group of people have no control over their behavior, then what is the point of us trying?",t3_e7cf5p
f9yzc3d,t1_f9yxfcm,"Word for word what we think about self proclaimed narcissists in the suport group we're you went on commenting other people don't need their own space but you can? I'm off of this page, and NOT GOING TO ARGUE WITH YOU ABOUT THAT. See the difference?",t3_e7cf5p
fa0jwfy,t1_fa0ic3l,"I'm not lacking on empathy, I understand, but you don't get to be a ""victim"" of your condition and not give that freedom to others IN THEIR GROUP. If you think I'm afraid of being kicked out of this group, you seriously underestimate the need I have for a bunch of self-centered talk and especially the victimization! I have never commented on this kind of sub's. Nothing to say to people who aren't going to lern s*] &, no matter how much I try. You went to unknown territory and tried to provoque, I'll go after you!",t3_e7cf5p
fa17bpo,t1_fa12ykv,"yeah i guess so... i’m gonna be open about this for once but it really does bother me. i have half of myself saying i’m great and half saying i’m terrible, and the terrible side only gets reinforced as i see the people bashing narcissists. this also reinforces the opposing side though, it just intensifies the fight between my self esteem and it’s almost like splitting with myself in a way. to be honest it’s pretty distressing. i guess it’s just a lot of desperate attempts to try to set the stage right, in as many places as i can. i just don’t really know where it should go, because it seems like they’re the people that need to hear it the most. i don’t know how to launch this idea of reducing the stigma around cluster b’s, and i really want to know. i’m basically grabbing at straws if that makes sense. whenever something upsets me like that i go back to what i do as a narcissist, i do whatever it takes to escape those bad feelings and thoughts. it really is the worst part of the disorder i think.

edit: i’ve been in a half grandiose half insecure state for a little bit now so it’s like being delusional but also truthful at the same time, it’s confusing and definitely affecting the way i act and speak, even in the subreddit. just some background.",t3_e7cf5p
f9yz253,t1_f9yy1ot,"you literally said that narcissists can’t have functioning relationships. that’s an insult, not a fact. and stop trying to change them! don’t interact with them in the first place! that would literally solve your problems. most people are actually fine at dealing with us, it’s just people like you that make it difficult",t3_e7cf5p

fa0lajc,t1_fa0jwfy,"you sound like you have a revenge mentality. you were hurt by a narc at some point and i can tell you’re trying to reclaim that power. attacking other subreddits won’t help you though, you should really learn to keep your cool when provoked, even if it wasn’t an intentional provocation (like mine was, it was a simple comment, not meant to upset anyone). trying to hurt the narcissists of the world makes you just as bad as you say we are.",t3_e7cf5p
fa1jhc0,t1_fa17bpo,"That fight between the two halves of you sounds horrible, but you express it very clearly. Having that kind of ability to understand all the moving parts inside you is (sadly) not at all common, and it puts you in a very good position in the long term, even though it might lead to short term pain.

The world, populated as it is with largely stupid or ignorant people, could be seen as a machine for churning out precisely the kind of ignorant, unfightable injustices which you are struggling with. Just as you wish that you could shake people by the shoulders and explain some of the subtleties of NPD to them, I wish that I could make other groups of people understand certain basic facts. But it so often feels like an insurmountable task.

If I may be presumptuous enough to offer advice, I will offer it in two bits:

1) Although the world is full of hatred and misunderstanding of people with NPD, and that is certainly a bad thing, you can put a limit on how much you let it get to you. As with any sensitive and deeply personal issue, you should probably only share your NPD diagnosis with people whom you know very well and trust deeply. If you do this, you have nothing to worry about, no matter how vitriolic the general attitude towsrds NPD becomes.

2) I am almost certain that there must be some kind of organisation(s) which represent people with NPD and campaign for understanding. If you feel, even after thinking about this for a while and giving yourself space to reflect, that this is something you care very strongly about, then you don't have to try to solve the problem on your own; you can get involved with an organisation like that.


When narcissists behave badly, they can be truly monstrous. But any sensible person has nothing but respect and sympathy for NPD sufferers who want to be kind to themselves and others.",t3_e7cf5p
f9z14x1,t1_f9yz253,"Lol, no. You started the interaction. I hope you learned your lesson and don't comment stupid shit on those groups. Said many times don't want to change them and that they are not going to change.

fa1uuva,t1_fa1jhc0,"yeah, it’s probably uncommon because it’s the toughest place to be when it comes to the disorder. knowing your inner workings but struggling to change them. noticing when you lash out or slightly manipulate the conversation, but not being able to take it back or learn from mistakes. it really is the place that’s the most painful for yourself, but it’s part of trying to be better i suppose. if i’m being honest a good part of me doesn’t want to get better. i’m afraid that if i do then my personality will change dramatically and i won’t be myself anymore. like i know that my behavior does hurt people but my ability to care about it just isn’t there, i should feel bad but it just doesn’t register. most of the time i feel like i’ll be stuck in this limbo of semi-self awareness for the rest of my life. i don’t see why i should change for other people, because i’m okay with how i am, so why aren’t they? it’s impossible for me to see the other point of view and all i have is my grandiosity and insecurity as a guideline. it just feels like i can’t change. the only reason i’m so open online is because an opinion can’t really be made around me, since it’s an anon account without a name. even then i don’t trust anyone who personally knows me, not even family, so nobody actually knows about my diagnosis besides the professionals i see. even then though with nobody knowing, it still gets hard to just be passive when the issue or topic comes up. my anger is so out of control that whenever it does come up irl (which is rare thankfully) i just have to leave the room and not interact for a while. i can’t keep it under control well, so hiding it does help but probably isn’t a good long term solution. and yeah theres probably an organization out there though, i’ll just have to go searching for it. sadly there just aren’t many sensible people in this world, and not many are going to give the respect or sympathy we should get. it’s just a really confusing matter that’s hard to deal with. if only it were different..",t3_e7cf5p
