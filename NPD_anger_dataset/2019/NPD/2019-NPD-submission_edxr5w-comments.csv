fbm1b43,t3_edxr5w,"I got help and am in recovery. I'm sorry whoever hurt you hasn't been able to get treatment. I hope you can find healing your yourself. Even if your pain might not be your fault, it's still your responsibility to heal from it. Good luck.",t3_edxr5w

fbm0c6q,t3_edxr5w,"First of all, it would be cool and funny if you became a serial killer of narcissists. Second, you have a lot of narcissism yourself",t3_edxr5w
fblzno0,t3_edxr5w,It's fucking disgusting you have a support group. You are all my enemy. And i'm taking notes. I'll start a fucking hate group to take you all down.,t3_edxr5w
fblzk6b,t3_edxr5w,"There is no help for you. You make life hell for the rest of us. If you don't like what I'm saying, tell me, I will fight you. But I will bring a knife and kill you in self defense. Because I've already played this game, and I know your death is the only thing that will make your shitty defect ok. Please just die.",t3_edxr5w
fbm3ksa,t1_fbm1b43,"I am the partner to a narcissist who is trying to overcome his disorder and become a better person, and I am actually in awe of how much determination and work it takes, and the toll it takes on the mental and emotional health of this man I love. I was also abused by him... Not head stomped like OP - that is just fucking horrific. But I've dealt with my share of PTSD over what he did before he came to the realization. Seeing this post was chilling. I know exactly how s/he is feeling right now, or close enough. That obsessive, awful, consuming rage and wanting to scream IT ISN'T FAIR and to do SOMETHING to fight back, to regain some of that lost power and sense of self. I empathize but I'm also shocked. While I would be wary of anyone who showed symptoms of NPD in the future, and avoid them if possible, I would never, ever tell a group of people to kill themselves just because they are in the same category. I don't know your stories or whatever and I also am aware that the people here are mostly trying to be better or find a way to be what they know they ""should"" be. The few who celebrate it are the minority of posters in this subreddit. But honestly? The most shocking thing are the responses. The mods did not cut this down, though it is specified that only those who have been diagnosed or suspect they are can make a post (non-narcs can comment) and most of you only went so far as to be a bit snide. Some of the responses are humane and kind and sympathetic and I am in awe. Congratulations. You've all touched me very much tonight. I do hope my partner does not see this though..... No one should have to feel threatened for a mental disorder. It makes me sick to just think of it. He will though, since we share this account.....ah. Well. Thank you for your beautiful, empathetic response",t3_edxr5w
fbm1rl1,t1_fbm1b43,"I'm glad you are one of the ones who are working on yourself. The thing about the trauma not being my fault by the responsibility is? That's part of why I'm so pissed off. I didn't ask for this. Someone did this, and then worse when I stood up to them, but now I'm the one who has to work over it while they continue to leave a trail of damage? Fuck that shit!",t3_edxr5w
fbm0mio,t1_fbm0c6q,"Given their "" It's fucking disgusting you have a support group. You are all my enemy.  And i'm taking notes. I'll start a fucking hate group to take you all  down. "" comment, I'd be inclined to agree with the second half of your comment. Or maybe BPD?  


Either way, yikes!",t3_edxr5w
fbm0mxr,t1_fbm0c6q,"""you are like this too"" is exactly the deflection I expected. Fucking robot.",t3_edxr5w
fbm03a6,t1_fblzno0,Oh because not having a support group where we try to improve and be less pathological would be *ideal* wouldn't it... Gotcha.,t3_edxr5w
fbm0iwh,t1_fblzno0,tons of people hate narcissists already. Both narcs and non-narcs are tortured,t3_edxr5w
fblzzdl,t1_fblzk6b,"Come at me bro (*before they scrub your inmature, ironically lacking in empathy post, that is*).",t3_edxr5w
fbm23rl,t1_fbm1rl1,"Your life is your responsibility. You can stay angry, hateful, vengeful etc which is like rubbing salt on a wound, or get therapy/help for your trauma and learn to live a life beyond the abuse you suffered. Tbh your abuser is probably getting a thrill that you're this upset and getting ""supply"" from seeing you this damaged. They want you to think about them instead of yourself.",t3_edxr5w
fbm1aky,t1_fbm0mxr,"I wouldn't say it to just anyone who hates narcissists, I say it personally to you because of my analysis of your writings",t3_edxr5w
fbm0gnm,t1_fbm03a6,"Are you even capable of that? In my experience, no really. Just play the role until you get bored and do something to fuck someone over just to feel a bit of power... I don't trust your type.",t3_edxr5w
fbm13ut,t1_fbm0iwh,"How many narcissists have had to go to the hospital because they got their skull stomped on about 50 times for calling a narcissist out on their shit? That was an act of war I will never forget, and an act of violence against me that I want to return to the kind of person who would to that to me. But 10 fold, because I've put up with enough in life already.",t3_edxr5w
fbm05ql,t1_fblzzdl,"narcicist talking about me lacking in empathy? That's rich!

You fucking defect.",t3_edxr5w
fbm1jr1,t1_fbm1aky,"Holy shit you are full of textbook nonsense. Narcissist verbal vomit. I am all too familiar with your language. I'm going to double down on the whole ""just kill yourself please"" thing here.... fuck...",t3_edxr5w
fbm0shb,t1_fbm0gnm,"That's perfect, I can't actually trust my own motivations either most of the time, but what you can sure as fvck trust is that I got fed up with having a fragile ego and failed relationships, so for purely selfish reasons I want to change.",t3_edxr5w
fbm1hlg,t1_fbm13ut,"This also reads like other situations where people got traumatized by a ""type"" of person. Like people who happen to get bullied by black people as kids then grow up hating all black people. Not all narcs, lol. You probably happen to admire a lot of narcissists that you don't even know are narcissistic.",t3_edxr5w
fbm18jo,t1_fbm13ut,narcissists abuse other narcissists too.,t3_edxr5w
fbm1i06,t1_fbm13ut,"Well then fckn do that to that person, we are nice people here (and those that aren't wont ruin their disguise).",t3_edxr5w
fbm0dbz,t1_fbm05ql,"Going by how and what you write it's likely you are ""defective"" too. Maybe narc mummy screwed you up?",t3_edxr5w
fbm1r5n,t1_fbm1jr1,"Lol. I'm ""even worse"" dude I have aspd not npd. You are too emotional to be rational about this",t3_edxr5w
fbm0qig,t1_fbm0dbz,"No, I was abused for years by one of you people. Hence my hatred. It was a partner.",t3_edxr5w
fbm1xk3,t1_fbm1r5n,"I'm ""too emotional"" because I have no idea what to do with the PTSD handed to me by a fucking narcissist. I was chill as fuck back in the day, and I wish I could go back to that. But no, it's nightmares, triggers, and endless revenge fantasies for me at this point.",t3_edxr5w
fbm1acw,t1_fbm0qig,"Well, you can believe what you want but I am just a person that is vulnerable, hurt and bitter and is desperate to stop feeling that way. Narcs that deny what they are don't go to a forum expressly created for improving or eliminating our symptoms.",t3_edxr5w
fbm28nn,t1_fbm1xk3,Focus on coping skills and helping yourself feel better. I'm sure you can get a therapist or something. It takes time to heal. You can still develop healthy relationships where you both benefit each other's lives.,t3_edxr5w
fbm23ps,t1_fbm1xk3,"truth be told, I'm in an elevated state right now after seeing a post about narcissism on FB. I don't even know if I'm going to remember this in an hour. the mania caused by post-PTSD/Narcissistic triggers can be strong",t3_edxr5w
fbm65un,t1_fbm1acw,You my new fave narc after tonight,t3_edxr5w
fbm2cq4,t1_fbm23ps,shit... the adrenaline rush is gone and now I'm wondering if I lashed out at people who really are trying to be better... time to buckle up for about 2 days of shame and paranoia.... \[which again this cycle wasn't in my life until I dated a fucking narcissist! FUCK! I hate this.\],t3_edxr5w
fbm6rdj,t1_fbm65un,Flattering is like junk food for us though :/ Just tell me that I am on my way to recovery (or to finally perfect a DISGUISE of recovery heheheh).,t3_edxr5w
fbm7334,t1_fbm6rdj,"Fine fine ""you are on your way to recovery""

Yeah, I know that high. How about, I find you very entertaining",t3_edxr5w
