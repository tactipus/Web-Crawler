I dunno about you, but I have to try really hard not to judge people like this. And even when I am trying not to hate people there is a voice in the back of my head saying the worst shit about them. It's automatic and almost impossible to stop.

Edit: As a kid I thought I was bullied pretty bad but these days I wonder if i was actually a POS all along and I was the real bully?? Like I thought other assholes ""made"" me an asshole but the more I think about my life the more I think I'm just hateful and other people can pick up on that.",t3_e7s50f
