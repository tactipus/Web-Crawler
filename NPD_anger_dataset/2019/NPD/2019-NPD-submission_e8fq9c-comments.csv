fac6hup,t3_e8fq9c,"A lot of times our reaction to fear is anger. Especially if we have a history of poor emotion regulation, which, Cluster B's do. 

I had a patient who was a little girl in a group home who accidentally put metal in the microwave when heating up her food because she didn't know what would happen. The microwave caught fire and she freaked out and got scared. When people came, her immediate reaction was anger because she was scared. And then she destroyed the place, ran away, got committed. No one asked her why she freaked out though, but they should have. She was just scared. (No one inquired deep enough to figure out why she freaked out except me, mind you... Good job mental health professionals) 

Maybe not the same thing, but obviously you care for your partner and seizures are really scary! My partner always looks drained and like he wants to cry when I have seizures, and he is mostly neurotypical. You have a lot of stuff already going on, a lot of pressure already to control your emotions and behaviors, and that is a very stressful situation! Anger is actually not that surprising of a response.

Were you ashamed after getting angry with her seizure? That would affect your whole mood for a period of days, because I'm sure you'd be mad at yourself, and we all hate being mad at ourselves. You *would* lash out occasionally because it's going to take time to re-regulate your mood. But you're working on it and you have very good insight. I think there is more progress in this than you think. Your insight is what is making this harder, because you now know the consequences of your actions--how it makes a loving and supportive partner feel afterwards. Especially when you know they didn't deserve it.",t3_e8fq9c
facfbol,t3_e8fq9c,"As someone who suffers from this, I have a hard time perceiving other people's suffering, especially when it's not immediately apparent as most mental conditions are, as \*real.\* I think it's just a side effect of both the disorder itself and the environment I was raised in; negative emotions, even now so far into my recovery, and in fact most emotions in general feel to me as tools used to make people compliant. That's what they're for, and that thought process is how I was raised.

In turn, when my wife has her down days (not NPD: we think she may have a touch of bipolar and just general depression) I used to interpret them as her attempting to manipulate me, which of course would often work and I'd do whatever she needed because I genuinely wanted to support her. But, there was this undercurrent there: I felt as though my free will was being attacked, that I was being manipulated as I used to manipulate others. It took a long time and a lot of self reflection before I was able to pull this thought process out an examine it.

I've largely managed to move forward from this, but I identify with this last thing you wrote so much:

>I am ashamed writing this. Instead of spending the day (and days to  follow) caring for her, I expressed anger and frustration at stupid,  plain vanilla relationship grievances.

I've lost count of the number of days I've pissed away in impotent rage at myself or at her for ridiculous shit.

Hang in there friend. There is light at the end of the tunnel, I promise, even if you can't see it today. It's there.",t3_e8fq9c
facb8sj,t3_e8fq9c,have you told her--or considered telling her--how you feel about the way things went? (i'm assuming she knows about the NPD),t3_e8fq9c
fdtu8rw,t3_e8fq9c,Yeah even I hate it when my friends have problems in their lives and I have to pretend to feel bad for them.,t3_e8fq9c
fad8f44,t1_fac6hup,"This is good- for OP, that is. But try telling this to his victim. You need to take all this cuddly stuff so you feel nice and better OP, then let your poor, damned victim go, for her own sake, if you actually do care.",t3_e8fq9c
fadelby,t1_fad8f44,"I dunno. From his post it seems like his partner understands that he has NPD and he needs love and support. If he isn’t manipulating her into staying, if he isn’t being abusive and he is just working through his disorder, I think that’s a bit drastic to just leave his partner. If they have a healthy dynamic with one another, she is choosing to stay. If OP is being manipulative, he seems like he has pretty good insight so he might agree with you. He could perhaps ask her if that’s what she wants, because that’s insightful and empathetic and good communication and shows progress. Pushing people away is the opposite.",t3_e8fq9c
fadmuye,t1_fadelby,Yes very true.,t3_e8fq9c
