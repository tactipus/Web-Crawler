fbwcmg2,t3_eesd94,"As much as I hate the ""gifted child"" narrative, I think most of us here are probably in the same boat. Had a lot of promise, unable to follow it through. It's much more common than people think.",t3_eesd94
fbwel4g,t3_eesd94,"It's a massive double edged sword. I've had so many people comment positively on my writing skills, oratory skills, and many different aspects of knowledge that I've accumulated. And yet, while I'm sure some of it holds true, I also can't seem to believe any of it. 

I have a hard time telling what I'm genuinely good at, and when people are just blowing smoke up my ass. The only things I can measure are objective statistics with things that can be quantified. But still, the words of professors and peers that seem to view me as ""gifted"" only skew my own self-perception further. 

I try not to take any of it seriously, but I would be lying if I didn't say it is definitely ego-stroking. I seem to sway between disbelief of these comments, and over-relying on them for supply. It's a troubling cycle.",t3_eesd94

fbxtuu3,t3_eesd94,"Yup totally, actually I still am (I'm just 19) ppl complement me on my writing, art,public speaking,.  social skills, my intelligence and guess what on my empaty, I love psychology and people watching so I developed really high cognitive empathy (but no effective empathy, I don't feel it, actually I managed to turn it on a fever times but it was a really bad experience so I switched back for good), I can put together what's going on in someone's mind often faster/ deeper than they do (okay like 40% it's just cold read) (except romance and sexuality, trauma probably messed up a lot in my head and I haven't sorted that out jet). Also I'm the problem child of the class not by behaviour but since I have serious authority issues I'll politely tell teachers what could they do better and I always go around assignments to do it in a more fun/ engaging way. Ppl look up at me a lot often adults ask for life advices n generally ppl week my opinnion. And I find this weird and disappointing at the same time, I really need someone for a friendly (or not) competition. And I'm disappointed cuz tho I have quite a good self talk I still often feel I only managed to do the bare minimum. (Probably cuz im into a lot of things (especially since I'm better and have a medication what actually works) and don't feel like I'm metering anything). And it's weird cuz often I'm like bluffing n just doing/ saying random stuff n hope it works out, also sometimes the god of anxiety hits me w like an anxiety lightning and I get anxious about something I never had issues. But I learnt to use my god complex, pride, arrogance, anger and the fact that I still don't get what consequence means, so I manage life pretty neaty lately, also the fact that I somehow managed to quit being suicidal n cut out my self destructive coping mechanisms a few months earlier took me to a whole new level I never knew exist (trust me this level sucks too but way less)",t3_eesd94

fcmp1l8,t3_eesd94,"I could have written your words myself.

I remember in kindergarten, I refused to take naps. I thought it was very juvenile & embarrassing to sleep in public, like some kind of toddler or puppy. My teacher would have me sit in the hallways & read books everyday at nap time. Occasionally, she’d send out another sporadic insomniac, so that I could read out loud to them until they were ready to attempt their nap again. Nobody ever forced me to try to nap, though. In my usual adult-like manner, I explained to the teacher that I simply could not sleep at school, and she thought it was more constructive for me to read anyways since I was pretty bored by our curriculum. A 6 year old bringing her own copy of Harry Potter & the Sorcerers Stone to school was clearly beyond spelling her full name and counting to twenty.

 All throughout school, this budding complex was compounded upon - “gifted” classes, a middle school teacher revealing to me that my IQ test returned the highest score at my school in years (not that great really, small town), “you’re going to an Ivy League” SAT & ACT scores, winning math competitions & writing contests. I became so accustomed to my name at the top of every list and 100% on every test that it was a shock to see otherwise.

Of course, I’m not really all that smart, I just learned to read and write at an oddly young age & have a bit of an eidetic memory for numbers. American public school is just a giant exercise in memorization, anyways. But my teachers treated me like a prodigy, and other kids my age seemed pretty dumb, so I assumed that I must be the genius they claimed I was.

After years of being the model student with perfect attendance & grades, around age 15-16, I discovered my precociousness translated well into the party scene. I gave a speech at high school graduation for top GPAs in my class with a blow ‘n go in my car from my first DUI. Gradually, the drinking & drugs started to eclipse the smart girl aesthetic. I’d found something else to be good at, a new outlet for my ego. The best part, for me, was juggling being a perpetual teachers pet with my “extracurriculars” of older boyfriends, amphetamines, & alcoholic tendencies. The balancing act of it all fueled my transformation from smart, obedient child to narcissistic, egotistical adult. Also made a nice cushion for the inevitable “holy shit, being the smartest kid in a class of 200 won’t carry me through life” realization. At least I was also cool.

Long story short, after all that praise for my inevitable bright future as a famous writer or an engineer or a doctor, I ended up scraping through college barely clinging to my scholarships, getting my Bachelors degree in business(?) from a notorious joke of a university, and not even going on to grad school. I don’t know what is really to blame - personality disorders, substance abuse, or the undeserved praise from all of my public school teachers - but I’m in my late 20s now & am depressingly mediocre. All those AP classes for middle management, damn.

My kindergarten teacher is still my Facebook friend. I wonder what she thought when one of my (several) early 20s mugshots ended up in my tagged pictures. She probably should have made me take a nap like everybody else.",t3_eesd94
fbwdg30,t1_fbwcmg2,"That second sentence summarizes my life, but there is still time! ...Nah, part of me admitting my NPD was noticing how the perception of people wasn't as good as actually liking and connecting with them (at least for me), which I couldn't do. Becoming an eminence pales in comparison with that, IMO. Unless... Maybe being Xi Jinping (power) or PewDiePie (devoted asslicking regardless of anything reprehensible you do) can compensate for the inner void and loneliness.",t3_eesd94
fbxu8p4,t1_fbxtuu3,"Ok, so most of this wall of text reads like you are doing good in life and then you mention suicide. Why? People also compliment my empathy, I am a sensitive person but also have obvious narcissism and have done criminal/evil stuff (nothing spectacular, don't call Interpol) so it's a weird mix.",t3_eesd94
fbx99yh,t1_fbwdg30,any buddhist can compensate for the inner void with a bowl of rice a day and a dirty monastery to be cleaned all the time.,t3_eesd94
fby15gb,t1_fbxu8p4,"Well good question, I'd rather say I mentioned overcoming suicide cuz I view it as one of my biggest acomplishment, since I'm suicidal from the point where I understood the concept of death. Also I'd never say I'm a good or an evil person, I never had a concept of good or bad since I was published totally unlogically and I figured out pretty fast that ppl have very opposing views on the topic anyways. But yes I did things most ppl would categorise as immoral, but my motive is pure curiocity, like I've cut up animals, but not for the thrill of the kill, but so I can understand more about how they work, also I stopped it when I saw my brother cry because some guys killed a mouse, this doesn't mean I have morally a problem w it. I manipulated a lot of ppl not to hurt them( I think they got hurt like 30% of the time but mostly I gained n they got nothing or even they got out of it good, I simply don't care about it (like I manipulated my parents into divorcing cuz it had a bad effect on me, and it was really hard on them for nearly a year but now both of them have a better life cuz they poisoned eachother) but to test my limits n to figure out how ppl's mind works and stole a few things (mostly not from ppl but I stole a crap load of art supplies cuz they are bloody expensive and a few random things just for the thrill) idk punched a lot of ppl cuz I read faces hostile and I still hate phisical contact especially if I drink, minor stuff like this and planned a bunch of stuff I could seriously get in trouble but didn't done it. The point is my curiocity is outwaights my concern for others even tho I don't gain anything long therm from turning ppl against me (did I pissed off or made ppl fall for me just cuz I was interested if I know them enough for this? Sure I did but never w the intent of hurting them also never w regard to their safety) also I really don't want to reassure the stigma around npd so I sometimes go out of my way for that",t3_eesd94

fby3cv2,t1_fby15gb,"Killing animals for curiosity would be ""evil"" but stopping because it upsets your brother would be ""good"" as long as you do it because him feeling bad makes YOU feel bad and it's not just a learned façade. Social morality is relative only to an extent, as a rule of thumb harming other lifeforms for pleasure or advantages is evil. Now, don't get offended if I don't address the rest of this new wall of text, but you need to use paragraphs or write much less. But I will say you also seem ASPD on top of just narc. Although at your age I behaved fairly similarly, and I am not a psycho/sociopath, maybe you will mature and it will pass.",t3_eesd94
fbxbwzm,t1_fbxbtdc,how many years do you need trying to become head of the chinese government?,t3_eesd94
fbys22d,t1_fby3cv2,"Huh paragraphs okay I'll look out for them next time, thx.

Well it didn't made me feel bad in a feel bad for him way, but I learned pretty early how cruel ppl can be so I tried to not be like them, also as I got older I got a strong sense of ""I'm better than everyone"" so I'm trying my best to act accordingly, and it's working out pretty well. Also I want to give the finger to ""cluster b folks are all abusive dickheads"". 

Tho nthe line between getting better and getting better but being more influenced by aspd is really blurry and I really try to avoid that stuff tuc I have enough trouble here thx.

So yup I'm also diagnose w aspd too but npd simply effect my personality way more (I mean I'm a girl and I only met w guys with aspd and they are effected by it more I think, but gender can be a factor here too)",t3_eesd94
fbxc1tu,t1_fbxbwzm,"Haha, what a bizarre comment. But I think I understand what you mean, and for sure I am treading more that path than trying to acquire glory.",t3_eesd94
fbz250z,t1_fbys22d,"Why you ""don't want to be like the cruel people"" exactly? Do you feel this would make you ""less"" or you  felt in your own flesh their cruelty and don't want to do the same to other people? Because the last option would make you LESS antisocial, y'know.",t3_eesd94
fbzus7r,t1_fbz250z,"On one hand I just want to rectify my never ending disgust and deep hatered. My constant desire to hurt them n destroy their lives (I'd kill out of curiocity but never out of punishment, tho tell it to 14 n 16 y old me)

On the other, I know exactly what a monster could I be and she's a nececarry evil I know so I don't hate her, or try not to, but especially since I can't say ""yea whatever in the end I just kill myself"" cuz I do have long time plans n stuff I can't be her. And I'd snap n it would be a downward spiral ending up in jail cuz I'd want media attention.

Also my problem w her is that I'm really proud of my intelligence and she is too driven by pure emotion and I'm a control freak so I don't like it. And I get way more attention n affection being a hot girl w talents. So tho I still play w the thought I know it'll stay there cuz it doesn't worth it. 

(N when it comes to aspd I'm rather the ceo tipe than the criminal)

So it's a mix of the anger of kid me and the calculations of adult me. Tho I really hope that makes me less antisocial too, I've been fakeing the whole fucking dsm5 to not get diagnosed but than curiocity was my doom also I just wanted to see the reaction of my doc.",t3_eesd94
