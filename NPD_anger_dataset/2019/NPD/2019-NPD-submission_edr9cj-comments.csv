fbkkq92,t3_edr9cj,"Where you will get caught is people's subconscious assessments of you. Coverts think they're masters of disguise, and in limited social contexts they may be. But prolonged contact will always, always give away the covert. At first subconciously, but eventually even conciously. Every relationship just becomes a life long game of hide and seek, as the covert tries to avoid any negative feelings within. It's impossible.

This is fundamental to why covert narcissists have troubled relationships. 

If you're a covert narc, I recommend letting yourself be found. It will help people genuinely want to seek you as a friend, partner, etc.",t3_edr9cj
fbk9v5t,t3_edr9cj,"People who know me well usually figure out that *something* is off in one way or another, but I don't think they realize just how severe it is. I don't have a lot of close friends in the first place, though, so maybe that speaks for itself.

People I only briefly interact with would never know. I'm friendly, shy, whatever.",t3_edr9cj
fblu4py,t3_edr9cj,"I like to think I am an undercover narc, literally everyone negates very firmly that I am narcissistic when I tell them. I am such a lovely shy boy after all... Except that I am full of hatred, envy and visions of grandeur.",t3_edr9cj
fbkvf1r,t3_edr9cj,"I got caught and called out point blank recently... by another self-diagnosed ASPD / NPD.

We both then said we want to become friends because nobody else would understand or would want to be genuine friends.

The big dilemma is that we both know (or at least I do)  that ASPD / NPD should not be trusted as they always eat up and discard supply etc; but we both now know the other person knows ... so in theory there’s too much danger in throwing the other under the bus (mutually assured destruction...).... and there might be a chance to make a super rare genuine friend.

Both our ASPD/NPD histories seem very high functioning, but icy destructive to all our friends/family. (At least mine is... the other ASPD/NPD could be lying.... ohh the mind games!)",t3_edr9cj
fblysny,t3_edr9cj,Do you think the cure is to find a stable sense of self esteem so that you’re able to interact with people without projecting you’re insecurities?,t3_edr9cj
fbk9rsc,t3_edr9cj,"Not at all. I’m really good at hiding my narcissism though. I’m self-aware enough to manipulate people’s perception of me and hide what I don’t want them to know.

I’ve spent a good deal of time determining what tone, facial expressions, body language, etc. most convey interest and empathy (even when I couldn’t care less and don’t really experience empathy).",t3_edr9cj
fbky1sj,t1_fbkkq92,"Fuck, that hit hard.",t3_edr9cj
fblvel7,t1_fbkkq92,"Yeah people always seem to feel self conscious Tallin to me, likely my insecurity bring projected onto them. How would you recommend telling people?",t3_edr9cj
fbmf6te,t1_fbkkq92,Exactly what my therapist is always telling me. God damn. Lol,t3_edr9cj

fblui28,t1_fbkvf1r,"ASPD isn't equal to NPD, although they touch. Why do you conflate them?",t3_edr9cj
fbtv8sb,t1_fblysny,Well a stable sense of self esteem or rather the lack of it is kinda the core of the whole problem,t3_edr9cj
fblucbj,t1_fbk9rsc,"Wait, this is identical to what you could read in r/Sociopath. I thought we narcs do have *some* empathy and interest in what others have to say?",t3_edr9cj
fblat6a,t1_fbky1sj,"Spoken from pure experience, my evil dude / gal",t3_edr9cj
fbpdh4u,t1_fblvel7,Telling people what? That you're a covert narcissist?,t3_edr9cj
fbpddpb,t1_fbmf6te,"My words come from direct experience, so I hope this helps strengthen your relationship with your therapist!",t3_edr9cj
fbpfgyv,t1_fbmhstv,"Yeah! So it's an attack on two fronts. Let yourself be found by yourself, and let yourself be found by others. 

For yourself that means allowing yourself to feel your full emotions. Do not repress or hinder them. Let them be ugly and imperfect. Express them even if they're imperfect through art or journaling. Dont necessarily give them full control of decision making, but certainly let them play a bigger role (i.e. dont murder someone cause they make you mad, but if you need to go hit a literal punching bag that's good!). Experiment with letting your emotions rule every decision for a day or two. Start to connect with the self that is true but flawed i.e. let your true self be found.

Thheennn let people see you in imperfect states. Give up on being perfect to achieve an alterior motive, and instead allow people to know you for your true self even if it means risking their disapproval. Be vulnerable with people. Tell them about your feelings, in healthy ways. Risk being unattractive or unsuccessful if it means being true to your emotional state. 

I'd recommend doing this first with your therapist, because it's their entire job to be non-judgmental and get to know you. If you're therapist is bad you can DM me and we can practice a little too!",t3_edr9cj
fbnbfbn,t1_fblui28,"Yer I know they different. NPD has a specific goal, ASPD doesn’t seem to have a goal, but the means and approach to interactions are so similar enough.

The second reason is because there aren’t that many NPDs and ASPDs, so finding like people who are also willing to be transparent is so rare that the attraction to the sharing of experience is too high. Call it settling for the harder drug because the usual drug is already super rare if I dare with such a metaphor.",t3_edr9cj
fbm0zw4,t1_fblucbj,"I was diagnosed NPD with ASPD traits, so my experience probably doesn’t represent the whole NPD population.",t3_edr9cj
fbm0a0g,t1_fblat6a,"I find that standard NPD produces evil but isn't evil itself, whereas malignant narcissism would fit the requirements fully.",t3_edr9cj

fbpbfgf,t1_fbm0a0g,"Mostly I was commenting on their username, but I love this assessment!",t3_edr9cj
fbs2317,t1_fbr4fuz,I appreciate your observation; I think you're right.,t3_edr9cj
fbqr046,t1_fbpbfgf,"Oh, right, my bad.",t3_edr9cj
