faecj9y,t3_e8qyhp,"I'm a chronic weed smoker. It's actually my weed use that has allowed me to realize a lot of narc things about myself: the masks I wear, my selfishness, my fakeness, etc. But it also makes me feel like a stoner and a loser and adds to my shame hugely. I need to quit.",t3_e8qyhp

fadx76w,t3_e8qyhp,"all the drugs and shit i did was back in highschool when i was an addict, i don’t do it anymore though. now that it’s out of the way i’ll get into everything i did. MDMA gave me month long depressive episode and i felt like offing myself for a long time after. the high was fun but eventually i felt sick and paranoid. hallucinogens as a group are alright, though it’s basically like the MDMA but not as long lasting in terms of lingering side effects. comedown was still rough but only lasted i’d say a long as the initial high did. not as much of the colors and imagery you’d expect, but things do stand out more. id compare it to a full body high after smoking a ton of weed. weed was fine for my honestly, i liked it for a while but eventually after a few years it lost its touch after smoking it chronically. i don’t miss it though, it definitely was the thing that led me to do everything else. adderal and ritalin didn’t do much for me in the way of a high, it just gave me a headache and made me pretty calm for a while (then again i have adhd). opiates are the worst just don’t fucking do them. oxy’s were a favorite but i completely regret even trying them. it’s like you got really drunk but you feel really heavy and warm, it was odd but honestly it was a nice feeling. but i would never do it again after how much i used to do them. coke was fucking awful. you’ll be off the wall for a solid 30 minutes and then have to do more, and after you finish what you’ve got you crash *hard*. it wasn’t a depression type of effect but it was definitely a negative one, i don’t know how i’d describe it. and then there’s standard alcohol, which i did plenty of. blackout drinking was a typical weekend (and oftentimes school night) activity for me. vodka in water bottles type deal. eventually i did check myself into rehab since it took over a good part of my life, and after a good 3 years of sobriety i’m not feeling the need to go back to it. shits terrible though, just don’t do drugs if you haven’t already. it only leads to being worse off in life.",t3_e8qyhp
fb0pwnh,t3_e8qyhp,"LSD. “Nooooo one can stop me” attitude. It also gave me this weird effect where I can really sense someone’s body language and inner thought, but it only makes me more awkward since I still can’t emphasize and use it to further “leech” off people.

It’s funny. Psychedelics and mdma do make me more empathetic but it’s all inwards. I do all of that growing and finding, straight to the Ntrait.",t3_e8qyhp
faey9rm,t3_e8qyhp,"I only recently became aware I have NPD. I'm completely dysfunctional and only smoke weed at home. However I remember a time I had access to MDMA (ectasy) and was very functional as a human being. I had a job, a girlfriend and socializing a lot more. Gonna start a therapy for cannabis soon because it's apparently the only therapy I have access to.",t3_e8qyhp
fae3tho,t3_e8qyhp,"I abused a lot of prescription drugs in high school. Clean for a year, relapsed once and it made me so sick I never did it again, now I've been clean for three years. It honestly never made me feel good so much as it made me pass out and sleep for 14 hours straight during a time when I was really depressed and would rather sleep the day away than be conscious.",t3_e8qyhp

fag4g6t,t1_fafhome,"Good on you for quitting, man. It's not easy. 

I think weed has its use but it sounds like it's done all it can do for either of us. Getting baked and realizing stuff is significant in its own way but doing the work to change shit is on a whole other level.",t3_e8qyhp
faf1grc,t1_fadw5za,">Wow, that sounds like hell, you got prescribed?

yes, not that it makes it any better. Private clinic => pretend to have ADHD or narcolepsy symptoms and ask for it directly => they give it without question, legal drugs if you are willing to pay.",t3_e8qyhp
