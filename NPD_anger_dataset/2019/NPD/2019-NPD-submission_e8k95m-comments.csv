fadelob,t3_e8k95m,"Look I'm no expert, but it's more likely you're covert, like myself - and not overt..which is why the signs or symptoms are harder to see. I'd try get a diagnosis, and honestly you seem to be SUPER self-aware so I'd carry on with your path. 

I do recommend as you mentioned, not doing this for her. Don't go the easy route though either, go the hard route, fix yourself and then whoever you get together with will appreciate it - or, moreover you'll be able to have a normal fulfilling relationship. So not going the easy route is actually to save yourself, years - honestly, literal YEARS of fighting, confusion and therapy.   


Good luck friend",t3_e8k95m
