fbv1hj1,t3_eekpqt,"Yep. Comes in cycles for me. Ups and downs between thinking I'm fucking awesome and can do anything, and feeling like there is no point to even trying. Part of not having a secure identity I think which if you're NPD is something you probably struggle with as well.  


You can get through it, you have to accept that there will be peaks and valleys on the path forward, it isn't going to be straight improvement. There will be lows, incredibly low lows.  


Step 1 is starting to take responsibility for your situation. Even if it really isn't your fault, Jocko Willink's Extreme Ownership concept is useful in these circumstances. Next, get into a therapist's office. EMDR, gestalt, DBT, whatever you can find. Work on controlling your responses to these thoughts and changing behavioral patterns. There is a great book called Self-Therapy that is an introduction to IFS style treatment that is great.  


Good luck, it's hard but it's worth the struggle. Feel free to DM me if you wanna talk/need support.",t3_eekpqt
fbvb7b9,t3_eekpqt,"Yes, but even though you may be a toxic person, you still deserve to be understood and a chance in life. I often find that we get trapped in our own thoughts of unrealistic negativity, but it’s just how we feel with the hatred we have. 

A lot of people dislike me because I can’t socialize normally. And you know what? I accept it. I don’t really care or expect normal people to have sympathy for broken people like us. People don’t have empathy for us. Despite the challenges I’ve had in life, I still made it further in life than most. So I’m happy about it. People may not like me, but I have an amazing job, I have a lovely boyfriend, and I am really proud of the things I’ve accomplished.",t3_eekpqt
fbu8tec,t3_eekpqt,"Yes. It's tough. Turns out I can't really change. I've been disowned at this point and am about to spend my second Christmas alone with little food. Sad times but on the flip side, I don't really care. Shit happens.",t3_eekpqt

fbv481w,t1_fbv1hj1,"Thanks for the reply!

I'm actually ready for the extreme ownership thing with regards to the future.  Got to do what I can to make things better.

I've wasted an absolute fortune on therapy over the years.  Most of it utterly pointless at best.  Counterproductive at worst.  Sometimes I'd come away from sessions and later the same day I'd be reading a book about another kind of therapy altogether - trying to fix myself. 

With another experience of therapy I made a lot of progress but then trashed everything in a way that was almost traumatic.  

I'm in therapy now and I think that perhaps we are starting to get somewhere after about 18 months!  It's psychoanalytic/psychodynamic therapy.  A friend looked her up for me while I was in a crisis and couldn't think clearly.  Part of me thinks I need something more directive but I'll stick with this therapist for the time being as we do seem to be getting somewhere.  It was a directive approach to therapy that ultimately prompted me to trash everything all those years ago.

I will certainly DM you.  Thanks for offering.",t3_eekpqt
fbub57k,t1_fbu8tec,"I am really sorry to hear that.  My family still want me to visit at Christmas but I don't really want to.  I've been feeling too low about myself and very ashamed of my past.  They ""forgive"" me (or rather they want us all to completely forget my past).  They don't understand why I'm feeling depressed and I feel like they judge me for it, which causes arguments.

I still believe that people with narcissistic traits can change.  Maybe I won't change completely but I can learn to love alongside my traits.  So far, I've only ever been able to embrace the traits or feel full on self-loathing but I am feeling the occasional glimmer of hope.

Best of luck.  I hope you don't feel completely alone and manage to find some support.",t3_eekpqt
fc03vlq,t1_fc02qat,"You seem to have misunderstood so many things.  I wasn't self-pitying, I was self-loathing.  I didn't want to kill myself, I wanted to change and still do.  I wasn't trying to find narc supply from strangers, I was looking for others who had been in a similar situation and wanted to hear their stories.

Not sure why I'm bothering to reply, as you seemed to have your mind made up before reading what I'd written.

Merry Christmas anyway.",t3_eekpqt
fbuol8x,t1_fbub57k,"Thanks for that. 

Like I say I don't really care at this point, they turned against me , as a group, when they knew I was suicidal. The fact I managed to stay alive is enough for me to completely forget about the people who treated me badly and would have left me to die alone. Fuck them. They can have a shitty Christmas without me. I'm better off alone.",t3_eekpqt
fc47lzd,t1_fc03vlq,"Nah, don't engage with these types, I will actually report the abuse.",t3_eekpqt
