fcfeybt,t3_eh4yc7,"if you are not apologetic out of remorse you'd be gaslighting after the fact.

In criminal procedure you would be guilty if you obtained knowledge of a crime and did not report it.

It's up to you to decide if you see the act as done and over with or an apology at a later date to be part of the deed.

A district attorney wouldn't give you a free pass in this situation.

An apology would be a promise for the future. You feel bad about something with enough force, you are much less likely to not notice it the next time.

There is a chance that you knew what you were doing at the time, but you removed the doubt from your mind quickly, if you reject guilt, remorse, responsibility. It's up to you to not be a negligent person.",t3_eh4yc7
fcesr0o,t3_eh4yc7,"So many ignorant things are said about narcissistic people. I'm always baffled by how y'all are portrayed as *willingly* hurting/manipulating/gaslighting. I've read a great book that explains (and correct me if this book's wrong) that pwNPD cannot have denial. 

Denial means you push it aside and avoid dealing with it - but it'll pop back like a jack-in-the-box through physical or mental issues later. An NPD brain genuinely deletes the memory, so that whatever new memory it creates fits your inner scenario. The effect is the same as willing gaslighting, but the process is definitely not the same.",t3_eh4yc7
fcgdrpb,t3_eh4yc7,">you're making shit up (because that is what I actually believe at that moment and am convinced off 110% because it is me who is believing it) so you must be in the wrong.

person without NPD here. i'd be interested to hear more on this because this was a big problem for me with the way a friend used to deny things. in one case, he told me and another friend who's story matched mine that we were both wrong, with his usual dismissive and amused arrogance. i couldn't ask him if he could bring that 110% down to a 99% with something like ""i'm almost certain that's not what happened"" but maybe you can answer whether that would ever be possible? i'm guessing it's easier said than done because of defense mechanisms working ""in the moment,"" but i think it could be another avenue to your own progress and less drama.

IIRC, a youtuber described this as ""authoritative denial"" but google isn't turning up much for that term.",t3_eh4yc7

Damn this hits home. I've aways had trouble wondering why I cannot seem to remember half the things my friends or partners say I do or did. It makes it nearly impossible for me to right my wrongs as I'm always seeing myself in a way that exonerated me of any wrongdoing. I was *sure* that I didn't do anything wrong.

Now I've learned to just listen to their pains and worries and know that if they feel that way, I probably had some part in it. It's difficult for me to willingly admit that I did anything wrong at first, but I'm getting better at reading into situations. I've taken it upon myself to trust others before my own narrative, knowing that I am simply an untrustworthy narrator, especially within myself.",t3_eh4yc7

fci3e8o,t1_fcgdrpb,"I have solved it and am teaching others to know how to handle me when I get in my ""110%"" by using this method on and around them whenever I can (works great on BPD emotionally charged situations too):

First agree with their point of view X, as it is obviously correct for them 110%. Then, without any accusations, list the facts that might have been missed by them (and could trigger the memory recall) and are causing your point of view to be Y.

If stuck, agree to disagree and continue this discussion at a later time.

This way we can save face if our memory gets triggered in few hours and we realize we were in the wrong. No problem to apologize then, we did not convince you of anything YET.",t3_eh4yc7

fcf0n4w,t1_fceyubg,"1) there's no need to be narcissistic to gaslight someone

2) from what I understand, most NPD people who are *not* aware of their disorder reshape their memories thus gaslight but they basically gaslight themselves along the way

3) in every group there will always be malignant people who do stuff in order to hurt people",t3_eh4yc7

Look at it from the self-serving standpoint if you wish to know the direction of the thought process.

fcfnzq6,t1_fcf0n4w,"The malignant part comes from sadism which is not a part of NPD traits. It can be from ASPD or BPD which are comorbid...

There always could be collateral damage from the results of our action, but it is never intentional, you were just in the way (speeding or DUI are super typical examples).

Actually planning to hurt someone with some evil plan, this is not someone with only NPD would care to do. To much hassle hiding it from other people, what's in it for me?",t3_eh4yc7

That works if the relationship is superficial but what if a friend/family member is in need and you couldn't care less? They would be mad at you and start complaining a true friend/relative should do this and that and if they start giving you a hard time about it too much (from your pov) that's when you could start hurting them so they will eventually run away (meaning: stop bothering you).",t3_eh4yc7
fci6iyg,t1_fcgfnov,"You can keep up appearances in the short term. This is exactly to prevent this ""you don't care"" shitstorm (more common from partners as they are more demanding).

This is same as gift giving, gift of my time and my help to you will need to be repaid in something I value in the same way and amount. Else you can buy the gift of my time the same way my clients do. Quid pro quo.",t3_eh4yc7
