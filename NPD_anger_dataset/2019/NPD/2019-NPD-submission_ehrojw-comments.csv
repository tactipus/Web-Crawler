fcl4ewh,t3_ehrojw,"Well the idea is to get over needing a supply, not find more of it.

It’s like realizing you’re addicted to smoking, then coming to a cigarette addiction support subreddit and asking where to get more smokes.

Narcs are addicted to supply, but it’s not a sustainable system you want to encourage. It’s something you want to get over.

....that being said, you’re young so I’ll tell you that sex, popularity, money, and grades are big sources of supply throughout college and young adulthood. Eventually you’ll find them hollow but go for it.",t3_ehrojw
fcmh2pp,t3_ehrojw,"The replies in this thread are heartwarming, and give me hope as this subreddit grows. Stay strong OP. Stick around here for awhile, I think we all have a lot we can teach each other.",t3_ehrojw
fcl5r2n,t1_fcl4ewh,"Thank you so much for this reply. I haven't really found very reliable sources of information for npd so far and I honestly thought supply was a good thing that I was supposed to be looking for... I really wish there was some book or website or something explaining all this, but all the information I manage to find seems to either be enabling or about fucking narc abuse ffs. So really, thank you so much because I really needed to read this.",t3_ehrojw
fclf73t,t1_fcl5r2n,"Cannot stress how badly you should Read “The Drama of the Gifted Child,” for a good thorough explanation of narcissism. 

My informal Reddit post stab at it is that Narcissist brains are conditioned to think that external rewards are the only way to feel good because of poor parenting, usually in the very early years of childhood. Your genuine self was underdeveloped, and so instead of being effectively attuned to your emotions and wants in healthy ways, the mind copes through a series of defense mechanisms. These defense mechanisms manifest as narcissism!! 

(Stephanie Lyn coaching is a good YouTube channel to hear about narcissism from the perspective of the abused too)

I’m around to DM if you need it.",t3_ehrojw

fclmkou,t1_fcl5r2n,"This broke my heart a little. When I originally read your post I was a bit shocked, and that was the wrong response to have. Then I read Silvergreen's kind and we'll phrased response, and your response, and I feel ashamed. You're right, there isn't a lot of information out there. The research I've done in order to try to understand my partner a little better and be able to act appropriately to his NPD (something I'm still working on) took a very long time. This subreddit is actually a wonderful source of information, but as Silvergreen intimated it is for people trying to overcome or better control their disorder, or at least find a community where they can talk about their experiences and feelings and what they've done without being demonized or criticized. Welcome to the sub. I hope that you can find the information you are looking for here. Good luck, OP.",t3_ehrojw
fcmh470,t1_fclf73t,I'm not OP but thank you for the recommendation!,t3_ehrojw
fclqymg,t1_fclmkou,"Honestly I tried really hard after my initial diagnosis to learn more about it. The best way I learn is through books, but all the books I found are basically just narc abuse this and sociopath that. Everything on Google is more of the same. So the only information I've learned about it was actually from the personality disorder corner of Tumblr, which is extremely enabling and anti-recovery. It's where I assumed seeking out narc supply was normal, because I read that crashes are caused by lack of supply, so it seemed natural to assume that finding new supply would make me feel better.

My problem with everything I read there was that I genuinely just don't want to hurt anyone. The only thing I currently have as far as supply (how many times am I going to say that word) is my boyfriend, who's been really supportive about the whole thing. He does give me lots of compliments and attention, but I didn't want to put strain on him by asking him to drop everything and validate me. But I also didn't want to do what a lot of people on Tumblr do and find people to use to feel better about myself or whatever. I saw someone there mention this subreddit and thought it might be a place to find out what I was supposed to do.

Trust me, I feel like a total asshat rereading my original post. I swear I didn't mean it in a ""how do I support my addiction"" way; I was genuinely under the impression that this was what I was supposed to do as part of having npd but I was looking for a way to stop crashing every week that didn't involve hurting someone. I didn't want to go into too much detail in my original post because everyone knows I need to stop talking about myself so much. I'm new to Reddit in general to be honest. 

Anyway, sorry for all the information you didn't ask for, I'm just trying to explain what I was doing I guess. Thank you for your response and I hope you have a good day.",t3_ehrojw
fclwrpn,t1_fclqymg,"Hey, wasn’t trying to insinuate you’re an asshat. You’re on the right track, keep going!! There’s a dark phase for recovery that everyone goes through and it’s rooough but know that it’s fixable and in a way you are as much a victim as anyone else. Work to avoid being the villain, and you’ll be okay!",t3_ehrojw
fcqfaqk,t1_fclqymg,">My problem with everything I read there was that I genuinely just don't want to hurt anyone.

That is incredible, I have so much respect for you. I believe the reason that most sources are about npd abuse is because it is so widespread, so you being that self aware and not wanting to hurt others is huge. I understand it must be frustrating for you though not to find the info you need, I hope this changes soon. :-)",t3_ehrojw
fclxhfh,t1_fclwrpn,"Sorry about that, I totally didn't think you were! I'm working on a response to your other message I've just been a bit busy at work but I saw this and wanted to reply! Thank you so much, you're very kind!",t3_ehrojw
