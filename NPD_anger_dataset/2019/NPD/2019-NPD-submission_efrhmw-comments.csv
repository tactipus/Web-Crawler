They're are many subreddits dedicated to the support of abused spouses, but as the person above stated, there is no concrete and decisive evidence in your recounting that your wife is narcissistic. Even if she is, this isn't the correct sub to post this. Good luck to you; I sincerely hope you find your way through this horrible experience and emerge a stronger person with someone who loves your and treats you well.",t3_efrhmw
