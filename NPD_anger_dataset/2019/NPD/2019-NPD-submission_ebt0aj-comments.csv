Narcissists are notorious for being disconnected from their true selves. You feel like when you let yourself be ""you"" i.e. let your coping mechanisms run rampant, you're a narc asshole which you know is unsustainable. When you try to be nice, you feel like you're being inauthentic, which you know isnt genuine. Both options are incorrect, dont live in this dichotomy.

Being polite isnt being fake, and being considerate of others isnt inauthentic if it's a skill you want to develop. What you really want to focus on is learning to connect and then express your genuine emotions in healthy ways in way that doesnt alienate others.

So when I went through my transition I let myself be super misanthropic and sarcastic unfiltered for a few weeks...until I found I personally didnt like how that made me feel. I explored other ways of expressing my true negative feelings (art, exercise, etc), and by processing them in healthier ways and accepting that I was always going to have flawed negative emotions, they started to let up a little. Anyways, long post but focus on the idea that there is a third option here and you don't need to shut yourself off from society to be your true self!

fb7vawq,t3_ebt0aj,"The pretending or ""false self"" is the safest place for those who struggle with narcissistic tendencies.  I think you need to change the language around how you look at things.  Consider this, when you're being nice, you're not pretending, you are essentially unlearning what ever you have been taught.  You cannot ""pretend empathy"".  You can however do things that somewhat force you to tap into empathy with acts of kindness, consideration and mindfulness.  You need to do the opposite of what you have ever done.  So if your first inclination is to be mean or rude, take a min, breathe and then do the opposite of what you feel or are used to.  You also have to make these changes because you want to not because you want people to want to be around you.  There's a subtle difference.  Something happened to you in your childhood that lead you to narcissism.   But if you're here seeking answers, you're not as ""narcissistic"" as you may feel.  Happy Healing.",t3_ebt0aj
fb7ik3d,t3_ebt0aj,"I can and also can’t relate. Pretending to show empathy or kindness doesn’t feel like myself at all, and it gets rather uncomfortable. Recovery doesn’t feel like “recovery” it just feels like covering your true self. If I recover I won’t be me anymore and I don’t want that to happen. That’s why I’m just staying self aware but not trying to improve really, I don’t want to lose myself and my own happiness during the process of making everyone else happy by building a fake persona.",t3_ebt0aj
fbcw328,t1_fb7vawq,"I agree so hard. Just the fact that some part of you wants to be nice, even if it's not the dominant part, shows that it's not pretend, but genuine. You just have to nurture and cultivate those habits, and soon enough being a narc will feel like pretend (though you may still want to).

Everything is habits.",t3_ebt0aj
fb7zxch,t1_fb7ik3d,"I like what you said here. I would also add that once you create an expectation with people about what your persona is, you have to keep that up. Be careful what expectations you set. I also think it’s better to, as much as possible, have the same persona all the time. It just makes life simpler.",t3_ebt0aj
fb9u9kz,t1_fb7zxch,"That’s why I just don’t bother with it. I don’t like to feel unauthentic, if someone likes my persona more than they like the actual me then that just makes me feel frustrated honestly. I want to be liked as *me* not a fake me. I don’t want to put effort into upholding something that I don’t particularly care about. That’s why I just act like I always do, the people who actually like me (most people I’d say) can stay and those that don’t can just leave. I don’t want to waste my time on people who hate the real me, so I find it much simpler to just weed them out to begin with. You don’t have to put any effort into it that way.",t3_ebt0aj
fbali9w,t1_fb9u9kz,"Do you lives alone, now?",t3_ebt0aj
fbato6b,t1_fbali9w,"No, that’s another reason I don’t bother, because if I did then I’d have to pretend 24/7 and that’s exhausting for any person to do really.",t3_ebt0aj
fbau7kv,t1_fbato6b,I don’t live alone and so I pretend 24/7 and it IS exhausting!,t3_ebt0aj
fbbae2w,t1_fbau7kv,That sucks. Hopefully you’ll be able to live alone soon.,t3_ebt0aj
