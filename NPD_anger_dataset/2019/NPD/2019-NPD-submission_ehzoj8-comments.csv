fcmjoxc,t3_ehzoj8,"I think you have a really good point. Our ego is more concerned with limiting negative traits rather than cultivating positive ones. As you said, this is still mainly a narcissistic viewpoint.

In another thread we discussed the importance of outward compassion, and how it can actually lead to more love for ones self than curbing the negative behaviors. There's a lot to be said about developing a true sense of self through positive service, something I have recently been learning a lot about in my support group. 

Again I think it comes down to self love. Stopping our negative behaviors is important, yes. But focusing on stopping them almost never works in and of itself. It has to be creating a self that we appreciate, a self that is compassionate and caring beyond the ego. Through these acts of goodness, the bad ones will naturally dissipate. 

Instead of trying so hard to kick a bad habit, we simply replace it with an alternate healthier one. In this case, we don't put all of the burden on ourselves to stop being negative. Instead, we focus on doing good things.",t3_ehzoj8
fcmsy93,t3_ehzoj8,"I feel like that’s more of a covert problem. Coverts focus on the negative and overemphasize it like you said. Grandiose narcissists like myself however overemphasize the positives, and regularly ignore the negatives or don’t even recognize them. This often makes us the more delusional ones when it comes to awareness. I’m self aware to a degree but not nearly as much as I think I am. Personally I don’t feel a need for “positive” behavior because I just really don’t want to, I don’t think it’s necessary for me. I take a neutral and logical approach to things, so whether it’s positive or negative really is situational. I just behave according to what the situation needs and what I feel is right in the moment, even if it would be seen as negative. If it needs to be said or done then it will be.",t3_ehzoj8
ff0gv7f,t3_ehzoj8,I love the point you made there. Wish I had come across it a few torturous self-hating months ago (of mostly wanting attention for how hard I am trying to stop myself from hurting my partner/mum and how desperate that fights is). Never too late I guess.,t3_ehzoj8
fcni7hh,t1_fcmjoxc,"I really think this approach is the key.  I noticed once I incorporated more acts of kindness and mindfulness into my daily routine, I wasn't so much focused on what i was doing to hurt people.  I had this epiphany while I was home for Christmas.  My sister whom I don't have that great of a relationship with really needed help.  Her car wasn't working.  I offered to drive her which I normally wouldn't do because duh, I hate being inconvenienced.  Later that night I went to drive her home in the pouring rain and she left her keys at my moms house.  She was having a visible breakdown, just overwhelmed.  The narc in me wanted to be outwardly annoyed but instead I asked myself what would happen if I did  something different.  So i did.  I offered her compassion. Drove her back to pick up her keys. Didn't make her feel completely dumb or shame her (like i normally would) and simply did what she needed.  Not only did it feel good, but her response to me was refreshing and genuine. I thought I would feel ""fake"" but honestly it made me feel really good inside.",t3_ehzoj8
