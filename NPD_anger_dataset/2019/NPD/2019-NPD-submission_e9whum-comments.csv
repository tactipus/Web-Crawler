I can very much identify with a lot of this.

I had an experience of therapy years ago that went very awry.  Seeing things like this helps me to come to terms with it.

I always knew that I had some grandiosity - it had caused me a lot of embarrassment and social isolation during my childhood and adolescence.  I could look back on it and say that things would have been better for me if I hadn't been so grandiose.  However, I found it very difficult to be aware of my grandiose traits in the present moment.  But I did I try, I really did. 

 It was addiction therapy so when the concept of cognitive distortions came up in group therapy, I openly admitted that the idea was hard for me and that it made me feel like I was stupid and that my mind was letting me down. No one else in the group seemed particularly bothered or to get where I was coming from.  I was glad that I'd said it.  It was a true moment of vulnerability from me.  I wish we had been able to work on it, as it would have been a great opportunity to grow.

A few months later, on a group follow-up day, I was still struggling with the idea and said ""I don't get the idea of cognitive distortions.  I don't think I have them."".  

I think that there was also some negative counter-transference.  I felt like the therapist sometimes enjoyed seeing me feel humbled in a way that was kind of cruel.  Or maybe that was simply me struggling with being vulnerable.  It's hard to come to terms with the fact that I'll never be able to know how much of the pain was due to my own difficulties with bring vulnerable and how much was due to the therapist lacking empathy or potentially being somewhat cruel about it.

I was seeing the same therapist individually, which I don't think was a good idea at all.  I was starting to become vulnerable (and to some extent, be forced to be vulnerable) in individual therapy.  It hurt when I realised the possibility of how I could change and grow if I gave up my grandiose thinking and asked for help.  A really weird feeling started to build up inside me.  I made a really minor mistake (burned some onions while making a spaghetti bolognese) and for some reason, that was the last straw.  I emailed her to say ""I can't stop hating myself."" and to suggest that it would be better if I saw a male therapist.  

She replied and said that I might be feeling that way because the group therapy follow up day was scheduled to happen soon.  I was resisting the follow up day and devaluing the group therapy.  I was doing it, in part, because group therapy was something that she was passionate about and I didn't want to keep ""doing what she wanted me to do"".  

Although another reason I was devaluing group therapy was because I'd tried to be vulnerable in the group and no one else seemed to be in the same place as me.  And I was trying (with great difficulty and painfully slowly) to be vulnerable with her in individual therapy but then the group therapy had come round again.  

She also made a comment in the email about how, as well as wanting to see a male therapist, I might also want to see someone who didn't challenge me.  I can still hardly believe this, but she followed this comment with the winking emoji ;-).  That hurt.  It probably was a clear example of the negative counter-transference that was going on.  I don't think I had really wanted to stop seeing her up until I read that.  It forced me to make up my mind that I would end therapy with her for good.  

I didn't tell her via email but turned up to our next session to tell her in person.  She tried to convince me not to end therapy with her and instead just take a break from it.  I almost changed my mind but I dug me heels in and said that I was done.   I even gave her a thank you card and I wrote in it what I couldn't say in person - that she had helped me but that I needed to end therapy with her as I was finding it too frustrating and upsetting to keep letting her see the most negative parts of myself.

Shortly after stopping therapy, I did something really really stupid - not a big deal in the big scheme of things but, at the time, it really scared me.  I was very upset and afraid and I wanted to see her again but, at the same time, I absolutely hated myself for feeling like I needed her and I really resented her.  We exchanged quite a few emails after that.  I asked to see her again but she said it was a bad idea because my defences against shame had been too powerfully triggered and I was replaying in therapy my childhood feelings of not being understood or empathised with by my mother.

I've found it really hard to move on.  Sometimes I miss her terribly.  Sometimes I just regret throwing away a chance to change.  I'm working on it with another therapist now.  It feels strange to have to talk to my new therapist about a therapist that I saw years ago.  It somehow doesn't feel fair to my new therapist.  I sense that things are starting to change in me now.  It's not easy to know that I could have changed seven years ago but chose not to.  With help, I'm coming to terms with it though.",t3_e9whum

famlhty,t1_famgk2h,"Oh wow I didn’t even think of that. Maybe it might be because we have the diagnosis, all of our behavior is classified as narcissistic",t3_e9whum
fao29f2,t1_fang08i,"This actually happened to my ex gf. I am fucking sure that she is not a narc (has ptsd tho) but that her old psych was one. Ex had literally none of the symptoms required by a narc dx but her therapist was gaslighting the shit out of her and after a while she started believing all these twisted things about herself.

Side note: Kinda funny looking back that I didnt realize then I might be a narcissist lol",t3_e9whum
faopxqt,t1_fang08i,"I actually found it on twitter. It’s a [Cambridge analysis](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bjpsych-advances/article/current-understanding-of-narcissism-and-narcissistic-personality-disorder/4AA8B04FB352F8E00AA7988B63EBE973/share/0b49f5c6a428c7bd30546916b8af3507e008006b?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf#)  on NPD. 
 
I’ve been stuck with this diagnosis for a while, and it’s definitely impacted the way that people treat me medically. I’ve tried to challenge it to no avail.",t3_e9whum
fao7vq2,t1_fao5ygg,Symptoms might increase during major life events which leads to drop out in therapy.,t3_e9whum
faoatzl,t1_fao7vq2,Thanks. That makes sense. I'm dense lol,t3_e9whum
