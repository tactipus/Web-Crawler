faiocou,t3_e9gbyo,"I have a tendency to view everyone around me as just assets to my goals. Having them around has to benefit me in some way, even indirectly. I have a difficult time viewing them as people with their own lives and feelings, and always just assume they‚Äôre as enamored with my brilliance and beauty as I am.",t3_e9gbyo
faj8wp4,t3_e9gbyo,"Sometimes I think I‚Äôm the perfect human. I think about it whenever I do something well, and I think about it whenever I watch people act completely stupid. I think ‚Äúwow I was born so much luckier than that tool.‚Äù It‚Äôs a nice thought, but sadly I‚Äôm not perfect. I‚Äôm just better than everyone I‚Äôve ever met. I think if I was more consistent with working towards achieving my goals I would be completely flawless.",t3_e9gbyo
fakb6hh,t3_e9gbyo,"A lot, but my favorite one is that whenever I achieve something or succeed at something, I tend to view it as the best achievement ever. For example, if I got a high grade on a test, I‚Äôd feel like I changed the world or something, like the whole world should stop and give me a big applause for getting a high grade, and even if others got the same grade I come up with weird reasons to prove that their success is normal but mine is completely different and unique.",t3_e9gbyo
fajibrc,t3_e9gbyo,"comparing myself to others in order to feel better. oftentimes i‚Äôm the most depressed when left with my thoughts, but when i compare myself to others i can easily pinpoint areas where i‚Äôm better than them and it makes me feel good about myself. also a feeling of ‚Äúit‚Äôs not me, it‚Äôs you‚Äù when it comes to behavior that people view as unacceptable. debating and arguing for the sake of being right and trying to control others beliefs that i think are wrong. making excuses and blaming external problems for my internal ones. blaming other people for my external problems. i really do have a lot of thought patterns that i can recognize as narcissistic, and it‚Äôs probably the worst place to be as a narcissist. either you‚Äôre not one or you‚Äôre ignorant to the world around you, which i think is a lot better. being self aware of all of your behaviors but not being able to truly accept that they are the cause of said problems is hell. i can see it happen but i can‚Äôt change it, that takes acceptance, and most of us can‚Äôt do that. i really do think it‚Äôs one of the main reasons that even self aware narcissists rarely improve.",t3_e9gbyo

faj9snz,t3_e9gbyo,Being treated unfairly by society all the time.,t3_e9gbyo
faw5plr,t3_e9gbyo,"- I don't get the recognition I deserve
- I am lonely through no fault of my own
- empaths aren't real 
- I have suffered more than most
- I am gorgeous and that's why I can get away with stuff 
- one day I'll do something great

These are the ones that pop up the most. They're not constant but they're triggered by various things.",t3_e9gbyo
fajmuzl,t1_faiocou,Same,t3_e9gbyo
fb9d18k,t1_faj8wp4,"Yo I have this too. I kind of think I'm the best and judge others harshly. But by that same token, I judge myself just as harsh. I try to make everything I do perfect, and if I slip up I beat myself up, and then reflects onto others. How do I fix this man?",t3_e9gbyo
fb9d3eg,t1_faj8wp4,"And I overthink everything now, can't even be a regular human. I think a lot of it has to do with too much weed though. I used to be much nicer, to myself and those around me.",t3_e9gbyo
fb9dabf,t1_faj8wp4,"But I really am the best at a lot of stuff, and I sometimes I look at others like jeez man.",t3_e9gbyo
fakbsk7,t1_fakb6hh,Holy shit same lol. For example I think a college degree doesnt matter for shit unless it's MY degree in which case it's very impressive.,t3_e9gbyo
famib6e,t1_faj3fea,[deleted],t3_e9gbyo
fakuadf,t1_faj3fea,"Wow- SAME. When I was arguably in the height of my NPD, I would literally have fantasies about my entire family dying that were so intense they made me cry. In fact, fantasies like these are kinda my default so I have to force myself to not daydream about, for another example, a school shooter coming in, killing everyone but me, and then I‚Äôd have to go on TV to talk about my traumatizing experience. Lmfao it‚Äôs so fucked.",t3_e9gbyo
fajn7li,t1_faj3fea,I don't have this thoughts.,t3_e9gbyo

fajhzjo,t1_faj9snz,i get the feel,t3_e9gbyo
fajn8r1,t1_faj9snz,Yeah. I often get angry at society but also I have problems to see things rational. Either im the best or the worst and should die. No middle ground üòÉ,t3_e9gbyo

fb9dbde,t1_fb9dabf,Clearly not the best at english,t3_e9gbyo
fb6n0xs,t1_fakbsk7,Lol exactly. I have a UK degree and I find that to be very honouring title for myself and I feel like I need to keep talking about it and literally everyone around me is trash lol,t3_e9gbyo
