faasbny,t3_e8b48t,"Most people ive told dont believe me. Tell me im such a nice person...etc. I actually find it really annoying, and then at some point i’ll speak my mind, my genuine mind, not the ‘socially accepted’ one, and people are all ‘woah....where did that come from? You’re such a bitch’",t3_e8b48t
fab2pmo,t3_e8b48t,"I find that the public at large likes to toss around the term 'psychopath' and 'sociopath' without any idea wtf those terms mean, even when they were in the DSM. Hell, even in my psych 101 class, it was just taught that they were people who didn't feel emotions and therefore would harm others out of interest. A fairly stupid and unnuanced way to describe it.

ASPDs tend to be VERY emotional people, and hardly look like the criminal masterminds you see on TV. They are probably the most dysfunctional of the Cluster Bs, and tend to be over represented among the homeless and incarcerated, because of the poor impulse control and lack of insight that defines their PD.",t3_e8b48t
faaro2c,t3_e8b48t,is he a narc or a sociopath?,t3_e8b48t
fabdemx,t3_e8b48t,"I opened up to my mum about it and she doesen’t believe I have it despite the countless arguments we’ve had cos of me being selfish, maybe your friend is also forcing himself to see the good in you, narcs don’t really have true friends tho, is this a friend that knows you or do you wear a mask in his presense? I don’t think I’d ever open up tbh, the thought of it is terrifying",t3_e8b48t
faecwhp,t3_e8b48t,Yeah i told my friend that i am narc too and he just said ´okay´ lol.,t3_e8b48t
fabd9ot,t1_faasbny,Yeah I can relate. I tried to tell my old gf once that I wasnt a very empathetic person and she started disagreeing with me and telling me I was so sweet and loving etc etc. I was sweet and loving to her... but that's because I thought she was better than everyone else and deserved good treatment. Classic lol.,t3_e8b48t
fabcp0h,t1_faasbny,i can relate,t3_e8b48t
fabcyxm,t1_fab2pmo,I didnt know that about aspd. Very interesting. Thanks for the knowledge. I know almost nothing about psychology and I appear not to be alone in that lol. So dumb that an intro psych class would simplify things to that degree!,t3_e8b48t
fabcpbe,t1_faaro2c,"I dunno, he doesnt have a dx as far as I know. He describes himself as someone who doesn't feel emotions very strongly or very often but that might just be his personality.",t3_e8b48t
fabinnc,t1_fabdemx,Yeah I'm sure my mom would be the same. People don't want to accept it. Neurotypicals are loyal. And they can overlook a lot. I think you're right. He's been letting me act like a prick for years and giving me the benefit of the doubt when he shouldn't. He doesnt hold grudges or get mad at people and we have a good time when we do stuff or just chill. I'm *almost* myself but definitely still got a mask on. When we hang we get grandiose and wind each other up sometimes. I only realized that the other day! He is genuine tho. I am just fake.,t3_e8b48t
fabx4gb,t1_fabcyxm,">  psychology

Neither do most psychologists, tbh. It is a highly subjective field, with really poor research models. The fact that it is sometimes called a science, or even a STEM field makes me laugh. It's honestly probably the single academic field that gets WAY more respect than it honestly deserves. In university, a psych major is tantamount to majoring 'in college.'",t3_e8b48t
fade2g5,t1_fabinnc,Narcs are still humans underneath. He prob just sees the human in you and likes you.,t3_e8b48t
fablebm,t1_fabinnc,do you have discord bro,t3_e8b48t
fai1msl,t1_fablebm,No sorry dude. I am a dinosaur lol,t3_e8b48t
