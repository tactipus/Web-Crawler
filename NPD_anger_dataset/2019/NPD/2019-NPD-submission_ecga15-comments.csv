fbb4r58,t3_ecga15,"I‚Äôm interest to hear which are your favs? Mine are random Gladiator, Troy (omg was Achilles a Narcissist üò©?), The Color Purple, Dying Young. The list goes on. I never really thought of if the movies I like starred Narcissistic characters. ü§î",t3_ecga15
fc0f0cg,t3_ecga15,"The House That Jack BuiltGone GirlAmerican PsychoNightcrawler

the typical shit

also a space Odysee and nymphomaniac",t3_ecga15
fbbac5a,t3_ecga15,"My two favourite movies are Silence of the Lambs (1991) and Atomic Blonde (2017). Obviously Hannibal is like a psychopath so we share some traits, but Atomic Blonde I just like for the visuals and how bad ass Charlize Theron is in it",t3_ecga15
fbbbxvs,t3_ecga15,Star wars the last Jedi,t3_ecga15
fbbxlk9,t3_ecga15,"Platoon, Wall Street (the original, not that wolf of Wall Street trash) , Mississippi burning",t3_ecga15
fbb5fh7,t1_fbb4r58,"Good picks! I‚Äôd say my all-time favorite movies are The Social Network and Beyond the Black Rainbow. Both have significantly narcissistic characters, but they also share commonalities with having incredible soundtracks and stunning visuals!",t3_ecga15
fbc7t1a,t1_fbb4r58,"I love gladiator so much. I don‚Äôt know what it is exactly but it‚Äôs the perfect cinematic experience. I think it came at a good time when there was a strong ‚ÄúHollywood‚Äù element and also interest in the period, popularity of the actors, balance of violence and dialogue etc. 

This movie is never boring and it‚Äôs so memorable without being corny.",t3_ecga15
fc0ie4c,t1_fc0f0cg,"Great taste.

Love Gone Girl, American Psycho, and 2001!üëåüèª",t3_ecga15
fc1vwvj,t1_fbbac5a,Did you see Red Dragon and what did you think of the Hannibal TV show and other movies? Great collection of thoughts and creativity. Scary as hell too....,t3_ecga15
fbb8f49,t1_fbb5fh7,"Mine used to be American Psycho lol. Now, I'd say Drunken Master 2.",t3_ecga15
fc1vp25,t1_fbc7t1a,Im gonna watch that later. Thanks,t3_ecga15
fc1v5yx,t1_fc0ie4c,":) you have great taste! Have you seen Lain as well? super cool anime but not a movie unfortunately, it just came to memory though. painfully quotable dissociative coming-of-age story about a technology obsessed egomaniac girl (with a deep ending)  
u got any recommendations? and dont say The Grinch",t3_ecga15
fbb9t7z,t1_fbb8f49,"American Psycho is a great one. Never seen the other one, though.",t3_ecga15
fc1zau6,t1_fc1v5yx,"I haven‚Äôt! Have heard of it, though (but had no idea about its plot).

I think I listed some of my favorite movies as a reply to the top comment. So, I recommend those!",t3_ecga15
fc1v79q,t1_fbb9t7z,Two very different types of movies lol,t3_ecga15
