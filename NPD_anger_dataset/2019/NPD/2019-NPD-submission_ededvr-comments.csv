fbhetw5,t3_ededvr,"This is the understanding I've come to believe:

The grandiose and the vulnerable narcissist are in fact the same person. Whether they are grandiose or vulnerable depends on whether or not they're getting their supply (i.e. validation in whatever area of self esteem they perceive themselves to be deficient in). Grandiose is the ""on"" state, vulnerable is the ""off"" state. These two polar ends of the spectrum then masquerade as ""happy"" and ""sad"", even though they're really just stand-ins for genuine emotions.

For me its really simple. If hot girls are in my life, I'm grandiose. If my phone isnt lighting up, I hate myself. My supply is really straightforward though so for some the relationship might not be so direct.

Extroversion / introversion come into play too but they seem to be coefficients rather than variables in the equation as far as I can tell.

What do you all think?",t3_ededvr

fblz2rz,t1_fbhetw5,"Nailed it. I always am upfront about this, the only reason I never blossomed as a prick was because life forced me to go the covert/vulnerable route through shitty decisions and bad luck. Because back in my teens whenever I had ""success supply"" it was uncanny the almost absolute lack of empathy and disregard of the opinions of others.",t3_ededvr
fbpcjlb,t1_fblz2rz,"Haha same!! Life gave me a devastating 1-2 punch. My dream girl turned out to not at all be perfect, and then I immediately moved on to date a borderline malignant narcissist who out narc'd me. I lost my primary coping mechanism (ONE day I'll be with dream girl) and then got eviscerated by a girl who was superficially everything I ever wanted in the span of 3 months. Everything I thought I wanted evaporated, and I was left with nothing but myself. Took my ass straight to therapy and here we are lol",t3_ededvr
