fb6t39l,t3_ebqo4v,I think this is such a great idea. After fervently researching narcissism/NPD I’ve noticed there is a real need for a space for those of us who actually want to heal. People think that people suffering with varying degrees of narcissism are just these soulless people that have no capability to change. That’s not the case. I’m seeing through the need for this space an array of people with similar experiences that actually want to heal. I plan on writing a blog to do my part to contribute. Thank you for this.,t3_ebqo4v
fb7mexo,t3_ebqo4v,"This is one of the most positive things I’ve ever read :) on so many levels, what a wonderful idea!

Absolutely support it. A pinned resource post would be amazing, 
So for myself in a community I am looking for several things:
- mirroring of my feelings about the incredible stigmatizating of this disorder is
- feeling connected with others, by reading their stories and struggles, and relating to that, and their thoughts/feelings
- ways that I can learn to improve myself, since the information on it is hard to find.

In respect to that last one, I think that would offer so much in the community.

As for weekly posts, I think I would prefer monthly posts. But that is just me personally, I don’t really know why, haha sorry. This is such a shitty response I realize, I apologise if it upsets anyone, but I am being honest and that is what matters. Maybe something with that I have trouble with accountability and feel that weekly stuff is too much? Or maybe because of my insecure attachment style weekly updates seem something I would avoid?
I don’t know, how does the rest feel about that?
Sorry, really working out why I feel some things the way I do. 

But that doesn’t mean they are bad or that you shouldn’t do weekly posts. Because my brain and feelings are by no means any standard I would wish anyone to follow.

Can’t wait to see them both :)",t3_ebqo4v
fb73t56,t3_ebqo4v,"As someone in love with and helping a recovering narcissist, I love this idea. It would definitely provide a better sense of community and support for those going through the process or wanting to try to find a way. And, it would help to see the way others deal with it and what works and what doesn't, and other ideas. I would support this 100%, and my partner would too. Thank you.",t3_ebqo4v
fbcyyux,t3_ebqo4v,"This article was a real game changer for me.  The author, Preston Ni, is so clever; he frames his suggestions for healing in a way many narcissists would find appealing, mentioning increased 'success' regarding personal and professional relationships.

fbdcr8x,t3_ebqo4v,"Sounds like a good idea. I'd like to see more resources that are recommended by clinicians too, since a lot of what exists currently is just this spiritual self discovery stuff",t3_ebqo4v
