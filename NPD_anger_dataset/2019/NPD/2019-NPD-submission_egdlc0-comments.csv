fc5wlvr,t3_egdlc0,"Hey there. I can empathize...lol. I do realize how fucking ironic that is.

My partner is NPD (we share this account) and it took some mind shifting to try to understand his similar inability. Especially since he was so very good at faking it. 

I may be completely out of line but it turns out....it wasn't exactly that he was incapable of empathy/connecting/loving. He simply did it differently. And since none of us are the same, that's really not all that abnormal, is it? For example... He can understand motivations behind the actions of characters. He can be affected emotionally by music - not sad emotions for the most part, but nostalgia, anger, excitement, longing. In other words, he has feelings, they are just stunted and very narrowly focused on himself. 

That leads me to another thing that I found interesting during my research phase of his disorder; the Empathy Switch. Take a moment and Google it. There is a theory that narcissists have the capacity for empathy but they need to learn how to turn it on. Some studies have found promising methods for stretching that under-utilized muscle. As with any exercise, the more you use the muscle, the stronger it gets.

My partner still struggles with this, and his range is very, very limited. But he's been able to extend his emotional concern/mental investment a little behind himself. The trouble with this is that it makes him feel more vulnerable, and that is not a comfortable feeling for anybody.

All of this is to say, you are not alone. Others have experienced this as well. I suppose the real question is, how MUCH do you wish you were ""normal""? Because there may be some things you can do to try to be. 

Feel free to message either of us. It may be easier to talk to him (Kenneth) rather than me. Just know that we are willing to discuss our journey so far in learning to navigate, accept, and control his NPD. Good luck. ðŸ’‹ Kasey",t3_egdlc0

fc6ih2v,t3_egdlc0,"I would give anything to be normal. At first, prior to understanding what this actually was inside of me, I thought it was possibly a good thing. That I just had a good control over my emotions, and that I wasn't overly attached to anything or anyone as I had been in my youth. Part of me actually convinced myself that this was beneficial to me, most likely as a defense mechanism to prevent me from being hurt emotionally ever again.

Now I see it as a waste of life. I feel like I am doomed to be hurtful piece of shit. I'm trying to keep hope that I can be a good person and still work towards that every day. But most of the time I just think I would help everyone else by ending my life. And yet, that would hurt some people close to me even more. Kind of a paradox.

I find myself wishing to just be hit by a car or get murdered or something so I don't have to make everyone think of my own suicide. I'm sure they would still be sad to an extent but it wouldn't be as burdening knowing it was just an accident. Then I can finally just rest.",t3_egdlc0
fc6t2em,t3_egdlc0,"Fake it until you make it, every action done enough times becomes a habit.",t3_egdlc0
fc6357p,t3_egdlc0,"Do I wish that I was normal, of course.  Its tiring and it is destroying my relationship tremendously. I'm still trying to identify my triggers/defenses.  I'd be doing well with everything then something happens, and I go off the trails...  I wish that there was a magic pill but I can only brush myself off and keep trying to do right",t3_egdlc0
fc66ftd,t3_egdlc0,Not really I don't wanna be like everyone else there's some shit about this I don't like but I still don't wanna be normal. I can't explain it but I'd rather be like this than be normal.,t3_egdlc0
fcaam40,t3_egdlc0,Do you feel empathy for characters in movies?,t3_egdlc0
fcb9qki,t3_egdlc0,"Yes and no. I seek the quality of peace and I've found some of it, which makes me look more normal and feel more free.",t3_egdlc0
fcb9jsw,t1_fc5wlvr,"Narc here whose empathy switch is turning. I agree. I do not believe pure narcissism is an inability to empathize. It is not easy. I prioritize growth, and even though I didn't see the value in ""being normal"" in itself, as an auxiliary development I have learned a few things. I've spent countless hours in meditation, pushing too far with life and death itself it seems. I've stepped a little too far a few times and this shell is only just starting to crack. And it sucks but I have a compulsion to be my best self.",t3_egdlc0
fc5xnul,t1_fc5wqjp,"Oh yes, absolutely the same thing here. I yearn for power but mostly wealth. A ton of it but based on my IQ, skill set, and several disabilities I know Iâ€™ll never achieve it. Sometimes it drives me nuts, sometimes I donâ€™t care. But yes, I know the feeling all too well. Itâ€™s weird too because when I do buy myself stuff Iâ€™ve wanted for a long time or expensive things I just end up taking them back or selling them. Iâ€™ve had people tell me I could win the lottery and still be miserable though. So yeah...",t3_egdlc0
fcap9a8,t1_fc6ih2v,The fact that you worry about people being sad if you were to kill yourself shows empathy. Im not npd and actually am prolly over-empathetic and thats honestly the thing that has kept me from offing myself too. Idk if me saying this helps at all though. Hope it gets better for you.,t3_egdlc0
fcf0bsy,t1_fc6ih2v,">I feel like I am doomed to be hurtful piece of shit. I'm trying to keep hope that I can be a good person and still work towards that every day.

You do get better. Because you learn from your mistakes. You stop promising things. You know how to respond and avoid the problems preemptively.

We do not hurt people on purpose, we just don't care or feels too big of a chore for us to keep up with their whiny bullshit.",t3_egdlc0
fcezx00,t1_fc6t2em,"With empathy you just become better at faking the physical signals demonstrating an absence of (actual) apathy.

If you do not react to people like a dumb sheep, you can not change yourself into a dumb sheep, feelings do not work that way.",t3_egdlc0
fcyzjvq,t1_fc6t2em,This only works somewhat.. for me it took several mistakes plus watching my grandparents die (over several years). Operating outside of yourself (to where you aren't the center of the universe) helps a lot. It isn't faking - it's acceptance.,t3_egdlc0
fcf1k1j,t1_fc66ftd,"It's a superpower, with great power comes great responsibility. You can light up a city with few kilos of uranium in multiple ways.",t3_egdlc0
fcbuscz,t1_fcaam40,Sometimes but extremely rarely and its forced. But weirdly enough easier than real life people,t3_egdlc0

fcarjva,t1_fcap9a8,"As a young child I was also overly-empathetic and it made me very vulnerable to certain people in my life. I started to swing hard the other way when I was emotionally abused, and now I'm trying to get back to the middle ground. I wouldn't say I'm NPD but I certainly have adapted many damaging Narcissistic traits that are not healthy for myself or the people around me. 

I appreciate the kind words, I will certainly try my best to hold on to hope. Knowing my family and friends would be devastated has always kept me from following through with it. I suppose I can live in limbo for awhile if it means I won't hurt anyone else",t3_egdlc0
fcf1t46,t1_fcf1k1j,Woah yeah,t3_egdlc0
