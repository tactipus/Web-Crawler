fc9x75t,t3_egt1za,"also keep in mind that if you catch yourself too late slipping into emotional responses like that, an acknowledgement and apology to your kids can make all the difference! let them know that you're doing your best, and remind them that it isn't their fault when you lose your cool. 

sometimes adults react inappropriately to their children making mistakes even without NPD - I don't have it myself but did grow up with it from my mom. I can't remember her ever taking responsibility for her feelings or outbursts when I was a little girl, so that's something I work very hard at now with my own child.",t3_egt1za
fc9ojpg,t3_egt1za,"This is exactly why I didn't want to have kids. I was afraid of repeating the cycle. At least you are aware and have insight. As soon as you start feeling off remove yourself,  go for a walk, go to another room and listen to music or do something that will help you relax.",t3_egt1za
fc9set1,t3_egt1za,Look into DBT distress tolerance skills and emotion regulation skills. Read up on stoicism. These three things help increase my frustration tolerance.,t3_egt1za
fcass5c,t3_egt1za,"I work with kids and I struggle with this sometimes (or perhaps often). 
I find removing myself from the situation helps a lot, if I can take a couple minutes to breathe and remind myself that it's a kid and they're not a person yet, they're not doing it to wind me up, they're learning, all that kind of thing. Trying to let my logical, wise mind win over my emotions.",t3_egt1za
fcchmv5,t3_egt1za,Don't know about others but for me eating sugar makes me a very unpleasant person to be around.  Takes several days to detox and my mood improves drastically.,t3_egt1za
fcb22gj,t3_egt1za,You guys are so helpful!! Thank you for these suggestions.,t3_egt1za
fchtf4h,t3_egt1za,I legit never reproduced because I'm scared I'd kill the kid. My little cousins are awesome little dudes and I still want to throttle them sometimes. Then I see my parents around kids and I'm honestly baffled why they ever thought they should reproduce!,t3_egt1za
fqx4z71,t3_egt1za,Damn...I feel really bad for the kid. I hope you don't fuck him up too bad.,t3_egt1za
fcexqfi,t3_egt1za,"The child's purpose is to make the parent look good. When not serving its purpose, no wonder it pisses you off.

Wouldn't a car that regularly breaks down (refuses to function as intended) and screws your plans up piss you off? Exactly the same problem. Kids are a total waste of time, they do not serve their purpose in 60% of cases and are eternal disappointment in that regard. This is the black-sheep:golden-child dichotomy.",t3_egt1za
fcasu60,t1_fc9set1,"Strongly second DBT, I have found bits of it really really useful.",t3_egt1za
fchxnwz,t1_fchtf4h,In hindsight I would have never had a child knowing what I do now. I’m grateful and I love my son but nothing stirs up your childhood trauma like your own child staring you in the face. It’s a constant battle for me.,t3_egt1za
fcey76m,t1_fcexqfi,"And you should never give half a fuck about what losers think about your feelings, that's their problem, you feel what you feel. How are you gonna (re)act on those feelings, that is another story. Do what needs to be done, never without thinking.",t3_egt1za
foa50k0,t1_fchxnwz,What about him? You're going to cause him childhood trauma,t3_egt1za
