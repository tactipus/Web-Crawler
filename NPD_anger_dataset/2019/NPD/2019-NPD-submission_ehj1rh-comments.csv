fcjlnz4,t3_ehj1rh,"Looking back, most definitely my mom as well. Very self centered, nothing was her fault, and she used guilt as a weapon on me and my brother. I felt guilt and shame all throughout my childhood. I actually used to be quite empathetic, and I think it's my base nature as odd as it seems. 

Sadly, she herself was heavily abused, both physically and mentally. Her adoptive mother beat her senseless and constantly berated her. Even said she only adopted her so she would have someone to take care of her when she got old. 

Seems like these traits are heavily influenced by our parents. My hope is that by noticing them now, perhaps I can break the cycle with my own children. Time will tell.",t3_ehj1rh
fcju0rx,t3_ehj1rh,"CPTSD from parents caused it, grandma was the definition of NPD high aristocracy fine lady, then I self upgraded into NPD as it is a superpower while having CPTSD is just being a whiny victim.",t3_ehj1rh
fcjmpz7,t3_ehj1rh,"Personally, I don’t believe in “narcissistic abuse”. I believe that every single cluster B personality disorder can be horribly abusive and toxic, not just the ones with NPD.
My mom is a textbook “narcissistic abuse” case. She gaslighted me to the extent where I doubted reality. She manipulated my therapists to believe that I’m delusional and that she doesn’t hurt me which led to a misdiagnosis of schizophrenia and me taking tons of anti psychotic meds that messed me up and she couldn’t care less.
She abused me physically and emotionally and even told me to kill myself so many times and when I tried to commit suicide she didn’t care and didn’t even visit me in the hospital.
However, she doesn’t have NPD. She is actually diagnosed with BPD. On the contrary, my dad who isn’t diagnosed with anything but most likely has NPD (that’s what my psychologists told me anyway) is actually much better and much more empathetic than her, despite being abusive and self absorbed too.",t3_ehj1rh
fck2cxr,t3_ehj1rh,"In no way did this solely shape me (she was only one of MANY people who bullied me), but a narcissistic and manipulative girl locked me in a shed after telling me to grab something for her when I was 10. She kept me in there for 20 minutes and laughed. Oh, and she even brought in an audience of her similarly-toxic friends.

She was a conniving bitch and a master at gaslighting. She was actually the first time I experienced gaslighting, and it fucked me up good. She’d just deny everything she’d ever do and say to me and while I knew I wasn’t wrong, no one would ever believe me.

Everyone in my family agrees that she’s evil. I still hate her guts.",t3_ehj1rh
fck40fa,t3_ehj1rh,"My mom. I have read those theories about narc mommy issues and I get it. Ed Kemper talking about murdering his mom (dunno if he was a narc) was a big mood when I was young. I got really fucked up from her abuse. Never learned to access emotions constructively, never learned how to process anything, developed some interesting frameworks for dealing with the world and people.",t3_ehj1rh
fcm0sca,t3_ehj1rh,"Nobody honestly, I had a predisposition and I was never disciplined as a child. I just grew up entitled and it got worse.",t3_ehj1rh
fcjq28c,t3_ehj1rh,"Not abusive, just a very goal-oriented environment with high expectations.",t3_ehj1rh
fcjzg1p,t3_ehj1rh,A bunch of them. Mom and dad went back and forth between neglect and over-compensation. I think my parents are coverts. Grandparents and aunts and uncles were straight up malignant narcs. I hate that I'm following in their footsteps.,t3_ehj1rh
fcql673,t3_ehj1rh,"Oh boi, I don't like to diagnoste, but dad n mother side granny are textbook bpd+ npd (both low functional) mom's a general cluster b and a fucking rat and father side granny, well I'm not quite sure what was going on there, but she was super distant, had no empathy (neither effective or cognitive) and super looked down on ppl ect ect (tho I actually liked her, she was in her early 20's at WW 2 , than came the sovijets, n she thought me that your pride n hate 'll get you through quite a lot so no bad feelings for her",t3_ehj1rh
fcjoz7f,t1_fcjmpz7,">She gaslighted me to the extent where I doubted reality

This explains my experience as well. Always wondering why your own mother won't believe you, always questioning your own sanity.

Now it seems I developed this tactic unknowingly myself. Do you find the same happening?",t3_ehj1rh
fckiovm,t1_fcjmpz7,Wow! This is just like my parents.,t3_ehj1rh
fckvg1f,t1_fcjoz7f,"I mean, I’m not super self aware of my behavior tbh but yes, I became even 10 times more manipulative than her and I constantly gaslight and act defensive when anyone accuses me of literally anything.",t3_ehj1rh
