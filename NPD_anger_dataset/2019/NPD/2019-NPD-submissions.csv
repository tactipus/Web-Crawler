ehzoj8,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/ehzoj8/curbing_negativity_vs_cultivating_positivity/,Curbing Negativity vs. Cultivating Positivity,27,4,1577777226.0,"I wanted to expand on a point I made in my previous post, which discussed how people often talk about how they treated their ex like shit, how they lost their friends, and how they are working to prevent these toxic (negative) behavior patterns in the future. However, I rarely see people diagnose their own lack of positive behavior patterns as a problem, and I rarely see solutions for how to increase positive behavior. This imbalance should make us suspicious that we are overly focused on the our negative habits, rather than our lack of positive habits –– in fact, this squares with the typical narcissist profile, since it's a lot easier to get attention and feel sorry for yourself when bemoaning your own negative traits/destructive behavior patterns.

As a covert narc, I think that I have mistakenly overemphasized my negative (toxic) behavior patterns, when in reality, the bigger difference between me and the person I want to be may be found in my lack of positive behavior patterns. 

I am trying to take this one step at a time now. For example, even simple things like accepting a compliment for being caring/kind is challenging for me, and I usually have to soften the compliment under irony/cynicism or by making some exception for why it was OK for me to be kind in that moment. However, I feel that I am becoming more aware of this, and that even though I may instinctively shy away from these compliments, I am able to now consciously accept them. Hopefully, these habits will engrain themselves into my subconscious and strengthen my ability to be a force of positivity to those around me without feeling emotionally strained or disingenuous to myself."

I've been crashing a lot ever since then, and it's only been a few months since I actually got my diagnosis and started to make sense of everything that's happened. I've realized the reason I was doing better then was that I was the head of my AP class, with teachers constantly telling me I was oh so gifted and going to change the world and just a bunch of other bullshit. Now I don't have anything like that and it just really feels like my whole life was a lie or some shit.

But from what I've read, one theory explaining the root of NARC behavior is that we cannot love ourselves. As a result, we cannot form a stable sense of self independent of being above others. I rarely see people discuss this aspect of their personality. Do you think it drives your behavior? Do you think it's at the root of how you mistreat others? What steps are you taking to love yourself more?

I'm still ruminating over how this relates to me personally, but I'll probably post an edit in the morning."

I have some pretty serious traits that pervade every aspect of my life and feel like I'm not getting anywhere. Not sure if a diagnosis is getting somewhere either though.

So how has being dxd helped you? Has it hurt you? What do you think of the treating symptoms vs diagnosing and treating symptoms debate?

I mean, if we aren't gonna dx personality disorders then we should just burn the DSM V already.

eh4yc7,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/eh4yc7/unintentional_gaslighting/,Unintentional gaslighting,11,15,1577618839.0,"I have seen many ""explanations"" about gaslighting from the so called ""victims"" point of view and they all sound the same.

What intrigued me is why I **never had any intention** of doing that, which they are accusing us actually of doing on purpose (like us being aware of it, planning it, etc...).

Then I realized that I created a rule in my life many years ago which solved many of my problems, it is: *Never promise anything to any partner.*

Why has this rule saved me? Because I actually do something which *looks like* gaslighting. My frame is rock solid and when I convincingly defend myself about forgetting a promise in the default way: like the promise never existed and you're making shit up (because that is what I actually believe at that moment and am convinced off 110% because it is me who is believing it) so you must be in the wrong.

After that, I remember many situations, when many days, even months later, something reminded me of me actually promising that thing...

Better to avoid getting into this situation in the first place."

Well I've been doing a fuck ton of work and there is one ex in particular I kind of ran through the ringer. For years. Well I guess she finally got fed up because I reached out casually and she was like let's never speak again. I sort of don't know what happened between now and the last time we talked but I probably left her heartbroken.

I was jealous and insecure with her. She loved me to death and I couldn't come out from behind my masks. I couldn't see shit. Learning empathy aside from cognitive has expanded my perceptions. And makes me realize what an idiot I was. Definitely not perfect now but the level of motherfucker I was, was vile. 

God I've lost so many friends, relationships. Everyone, pretty much. And cut out my narc mom. What a brutal fucking year. This year marked me losing 3 very good friends, 2 of which I've been friends with for several years.

I was so much at the point of doubting my motives that I wondered if I should have even apologized to my ex or was I doing that narc thing I always do. I believe I meant it, but I always believe I mean it. Then again I've offered serious genuine apologies this year so maybe I'm getting better. I hope so. 

I'm at the point where I am typically happy alone and can modify my behavior although I have plenty of moments. Talk about a journey of a thousand steps. It's tiring.

It seems like despite their worries and issues in their life they still appear friendly and happy. They still buy stuff, talk to family, etc. They care about things and love people. 

As for me, I don’t. I’ve tried countless times but I lack the empathy needed to give a damn about someone else. People tell me about their problems or when they lose a family member and I just have to put on a sad face and try to exit the conversation as fast as I can. My mentality is that if it doesn’t apply to me or affect me in any way, it doesn’t matter. It sounds awful and it is but its the way I have been since I can remember. Heck, even as a child I viewed people as tools or cards to be used. I’m manipulating as heck. Another unfortunate thing is that I absolutely do not enjoy life. I don’t really have any hobbies I like, no passions, nothing. As someone put it, I  feel like I’m just watching my own life in a theater and bored out of my mind and just waiting for the end credits. It’s miserable but sometimes I don’t mind it though. That’s the weird part because despite all of my faults I still like myself sometimes. 

But yeah, back to my point. Sometimes I wish I was like other people though if I’m going to be here a while. Being this way is freeing but it comes with its own costs. Especially when you can’t change, only fake it. But then I realize other people are so easily hurt by life. They lose a loved one and sometimes their whole world can fall apart. At least I don’t have that problem. I generally don’t like people either, so my social circle is basically zero to none. But eh, just wondering if anyone feels the same."

I'm trying to be better about listening to other's needs because I know I'm not the easiest going person when it comes to emotional things. I just feel smothered and have voiced it several times.

I believe this mindset stem from childhood of being constantly condescended by others, constantly regarded as a weak, sensitive, dumb, and a failure, usually by peers, parents, maybe even teachers, and were easily toyed around by sadists.

Teachers flattered me in general (with one female particularly harrassing me to write something and comparing me with a ""disoriented sage in a child's body), classmates even years later would comment how *oh I write soo well* upon me commenting dreams of publishing a book, and several shrinks bought into my projected *desired self* and recognized me verbatim as ""brilliant"", ""a great conversationalist"" and so on. 

Granted, *I am all of those things* lol, but all this supply coupled with childhood sexual abuse basically made me unable to care about other's people opinions and led to disastrous decisions in my 20's with the anhedonia/apathy that ensued and that makes ""being interesting"", ""oohh soo deep"" and gifted verbally completely joyless and null. I kinda feel that at the end of the road all this book reading and effort to understand stuff has been investing in a character that doesn't make me happy.

In the past, separation has been a big trigger for me, leading to feelings of despondency, loneliness, anger and eventually withdrawal.  

Perhaps because I'm more prepared (mentally and emotionally) for this particular stretch of separation than I have been in the past, I feel strong.  I feel confident in my ability to control my narcissism and in my ability to prove to my partner that earning her trust is important to me.

And my first thought is to be suspicious of that confidence.  

One of the things I truly hate about NPD is coming to the realization that you cannot trust your own emotions and reactions, and therefore I end up second guessing any extreme emotion that I experience.  Should you feel confident about this?  Should you REALLY?  Does it mean you're taking things for granted, falling asleep at your post?  Is it going to make you even more likely to lose control when emotions run high?

I hate asking myself those questions, they make me feel tired and angry.  I want to just...BE CONFIDENT, BE HAPPY...except I know that just happily going along with the good times means I'm less prepared for the bad, and that means explosion.

My partner pointed out to me not too long ago that I should be planning for the bad with every bit as much gusto as enjoying the good...I guess I'm still learning that.

Do you ever really trust yourself enough to be confident?"

Its so cool that there is a sub reddit for people with NPD. It's a wonderful opertunity to get your perspective on things.

Feel free to share both external behavior and internal thought and feeling patterns.

I grew up with NPD parents who doesn't seem to be aware that they have NPD. 
I also have a slight fear that I may have NPD. I have had certain delusions of grandeur in the past, lack of responsibility and entitlement but those traits have luckily diminished over time. The more time spent away from my parents, the more of the NPD traits I can see in myself appear to diminish.

God.  The Hallmark of the Narcissist: Realizing too late how stupid you were being.  The image I most associate with NPD is me with my palm on my face.  Stupid, stupid, stupid.

So much damage done, so much a TINY bit of empathy could have fixed...so much that the love that I feel for my partner could have saved, had I only listened to it instead of just closing all my mental doors and locking them.

And only when my partner tells me all that to my face and after a lengthy discussion, I break down to my ""wanted self"". I see my mistakes, I can acknowledge them. I agree with my partner and try to make them believe me.
But with all my lying I did, with all the cheating and manipulating I did, they can't believe me. And worst of all: most often, I fall back into old habits, thereby completely invalidating my ""epiphany"". Rinse and repeat, until the next time I fuck up so hard, and me and my partner have the same discussions over and over again.

I really want to always be that person I am after I break down. Always want to be able to appreciate others, my partner at the forefront. I want to be able to know when I am going to lie, and actually be able to see them as that. At the moment, I am in that ""wanted self"" state. I am aware of my mistakes and try to correct my behaviors. But even then, I tend to fall back into old habits. Lying, forgetting, and straight out refusing to believe others.

I know, there is a way out of this. But I can't seem to find it myself. What are ways you managed to change all that? Please help me."
ecphhq,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/ecphhq/overcoming_narcissism_through_the_framework_of/,Overcoming Narcissism through the Framework of Grief,31,11,1576737592.0,"I want to propose a new framework for how to think about narcissism and narcissism recovery: the framework of loss. Lately, I've seen a lot of posts (most recently from /u/anodyne123 and /u/evilbutlovingit) talking about the shame they feel due to being a narcissist. The typical narrative goes as follows: you know how much pain you are causing to others and yourself, and in moments of clarity, you feel a visceral remorse for being the source of all that pain. But once you go back to normal life, you invariably revert to your old ways, causing a cycle of self-hatred and despair. To quote: 

>I’m sorry. I’m really fucking sorry and it’s just not just a ploy for attention. If I had the nerve, I’d do what I should’ve years ago and spare you all from my bullshit. I don’t know how when I can’t get outside my head. So I’m sorry for that.

Grief is usually associated with the loss of someone so close to you that you know that losing them will irreparably change your life. Usually, it has to do with the fact that a core part of your identity was shaped by and contingent upon your interactions with them. When you grieve, you grieve not just losing a person, but also losing the part of yourself connected to that person: an identity loss. We grieve deaths but also less significant losses, like breakups or divorces. A particular characteristic of grief is the black-and-white nature of it: you often feel the need to valorize or villainize the person you are grieving.

In a similar vein, recovering from narcissism involves either minimizing or completely annihilating a part of ourselves. In many ways, this loss is greater than the identity loss from grief. After all, our narcissistic persona may be the deepest part of our identity. It is the basis of our humor, our social patterns, and our worldview. It might be the part of ourselves that our friends, associates, and acquaintances like. It may even be the part of us that they like *most*. And parting ways with that is going to hurt, no matter how you cut it.

I have found this framework helpful for bridging the gap between my moments of ""clarity"" and the mundane day-to-day, where I often find myself reverting to old patterns of behavior. Reverting to these patterns is like texting an ex, or revisiting your parents' home: it slows down the grieving process. But that doesn't mean that overcoming these patterns is happy or fun. It will feel sad, just like when you part ways with an ex. On the road to recovery, you will miss your narcissistic self. But that doesn't mean you're failing –– it means your grieving, and moving on."

Maybe the solution, is to not ""pretend"" when I'm completely alone, (So I don't hurt someone.)    
But DO pretend when I'm around other people, because, while pretending is uncomfortable, it makes me happier seeing other people happier. (Because as a result people are usually nicer to me. Which I guess sort of feeds that narcissistic addiction to attention and approval.)    

However, this would probably mean I should avoid making a family, or move in with someone I like. As that would mean they'd be around me constantly, so my true nature becomes more apparent, I wouldn't be able to ""pretend"" ALL the time. And I'd end up hurting the people I love.

(Note: my partner would rather be here and rather that I am not an asshole NPDing out. He would rather a great Christmas for everyone)

So I am working on the backup plan of what I will do if I NPD out over the holidays. I am wondering if you may also have a plan like this?

What I am including so far to prevent an episode
1) in a framework of sharing, actively including things at Christmas dinner that are part of my tradition so that I feel included and more at peace (food, music etc) 
2) taking breaks (without it being overly obvious) to gather myself through meditation and quiet reflection
3) ...

If i lose control, I will apologize and remove myself from the situation. If my negative thoughts swirl and i do not stop them and I am on the attack, i will apologize and go for a walk.

I am in need of a plan if I go over the top and my negativity and defensiveness destroys everyones holiday. I worry about leaving to a hotel alone or the like as other peoples holiday will alreadt be ruined. 

I am mostly brainstorming here but would really appreciate any ideas, tips, critiques around how to deal with the holidays and NPD freakouts."

My mum has full blown NPD (I have tendencies and a diagnosis of ASPD) and she fully obsesses for years about love she's lost. Her and her ex broke up two years ago and it's still all she can talk about, and the relationship wasn't even that great and she went out of her way to play as many games as possible with the person, but after they broke up she obsesses and tells the same anecdotes about their perfect romance. Before him, she had a partner that she spent 22 whole years never shutting up about. How common is this? Like I say, I had a similar fixation on my ex (although it ended differently as he has passed away and i've developed Complex Persistent Bereavement Disorder bc of it, but I wonder if the narcissism was part of the development of that disorder?

Which is what narcs do don’t they? To protect their poor wittle fragile ego. In class once the teacher was giving everyone a talk about something they were doing that they shouldn’t have been and even though I knew didn’t even apply to me and got upset anyway because I irrationally felt like I was being “attacked.” And I don’t really know who I am because I feel like I’m just trying to change to the situation like a chameleon (and failing horribly due to lack of social skills and social anxiety/awkwardness)

And of course no one can answer me anyway because they’re not a mental health professional.

Edit: I’m also extremely passive aggressive to the point of going the other way of being nice to people who were rude to me for the sole purpose of making them feel like shit for being rude in the first place. I once literally gave $200 and wrote an apology letter to someone who was a total asshole to me for no reason. Though part of me also saw that they were poor and I feel like part of me did actually want to help. But I was also mad and wanted them to feel horrible for being mean to “”””such a nice person”””” (which I’m not but what they did *was* actually unjustified and out of nowhere)

Edit 2: When I still had a counsellor I tried to bring it up with her and she straight up dismissed my concerns she says there’s no way I’m a narc blah blah blah and that’s when I realized thats probably because of my bullshit nice act. 

Edit 3: Also I have no idea if I’m acting or genuine unless I stop and really think about it, it’s all just ingrained."

After reflecting, I have come to the conclusion that the breakup was mostly due to my narcissism and selfishness. People have sometimes accused me of being narcissistic, but I always ignored them or laughed it off as a personality trait. I haven't been diagnosed with an official disorder, so I think I am more narcissist-resembling. I presume this is way easier to treat, but probably much harder to (self)diagnose because I am able to function normally in relationships for quite some time.

I was very selfish in my relationship. I would rarely think about how the things I said made her feel. When I said mean things, I would often just chalk it up to ""being completely honest, as you asked me to,"" when in fact I think I knew inside I was saying it to make myself feel better. I would sometimes make mean jokes at her behalf, or joke  about her failures.

Often, my behavior would lead her to become extremely sad and distressed. For example, one time I refused to set the alarm ten minutes earlier so she could have time for breakfast so that I could get my ""7 hours of sleep."" She started crying next to me in my bed. When she became extremely sad and distressed I would break down, and comfort her and hate myself for being so selfish. But sometimes I couldn't tell if I was actually angry at myself, or exaggerating to make her feel bad for me instead of herself.

I wanted to post this as a way to come out to people who have dealt with similar (but possibly much worse) narcissism. As of right now, I am confident that I will be able to be treated. I will be seeing a therapist. I am trying to think through everything I say, to think about whether it is mean, or hurtful, and whether I am saying it just for attention or to make myself feel better. Every selfish or narcissistic thing I say or do I write in a journal, where I write down ideas for how I could have avoided it.

I hope that in a few months' time, I will be able to enter a relationship and be confident in my ability to be caring, loving, and selfless. If this time comes, I will meet with my girlfriend and try to win her back. I am doing this both for myself and for her, but if she rejects me, I think I will be fine and able to move on.

She tells me to just move on and that she can never love me again. But our love was so deep that 'moving on' would feel like living a lie. I know that I could channel my cynical side to bury my emotions. I could dismiss her criticisms, and pretend like she will come back to me in no time (or at least miss me deeply). Or, I could hang out with friends, and just take my mind off and eventually forget the love and pain and just move on. But this feels disingenuous, and would require me to become a more shallow and less emotional person. Beyond that, I'm not sure how I could take love seriously after moving on from this relationship. It feels like it would require me minimizing the notion of love, since I would have to admit that the love in our relationship didn't mean enough for us to be successful.

Thank you for reading, and I look forward to joining this community, and to healing my broken mind and soul."

I am openly NPD in recovery. I openly acknowledge who I am, and work through therapy and anything else I can to get better.  To manage it.  I am past thinking there is a cure. And it has worked, up to a point. Avoidance of alcohol and caffeine helps.  As does exercise and good sleep. I was making progress, thanks mostly to an understanding and committed partner. 

As ""successful"" as I have been managing the daily NPD struggle, I am making no progress when something big, serious happens. When stress and fear rise, my filters fail.

A few days ago, my partner had a seizure in my arms. It was my first experience, and I was terrified. But once she returned back to consciousness, and as my relief came and went, my emotion was anger at her. We had been discussing some relationship issues before it happened, but after, once she was back, I continued to harangue her. 

I am ashamed writing this. Instead of spending the day (and days to follow) caring for her, I expressed anger and frustration at stupid, plain vanilla relationship grievances.  

I needed to dip into the well of love and care for her.  And came up empty.  That's a terrible measure of a person.  

I don't want to be this way."

Probably because he himself doesn't have much in the way of emotions, so I never show any around him. Just easier that way. Pretty sure I am not aspd tho. 

Has anyone else come out as a narc? I was stressing about it but it turned out all right for the most part."

Wanted to use them, or write them off as bad and acted toxic or hostile towards them. Now that I look back on it, I can’t rememver why I disliked people... but it usually was because I thought they were ugly, seemed fake, etc... 

But the reality was, I barely knew these people. I don’t know anything about them and yet I got so offended throughout my life that I never really got along with most people because I kept hating them. I always wondered when I’d finally meet “good people”, and make some friends, and then I realized that it’s me.. I’m the problem. Holy shit, I don’t even know what made me think like that. How the fuck did I write off like 80% of people throughout my life without really knowing them? 

Damn I think I act toxic to overcompensate for my lack of social skills. I feel awkward and uncomfortable around people, and my first reaction is to simply label them as bad and hate them. Wow...... I wonder if I have extreme social anxiety... idk, but I’m also not afraid to approach people if I need to use them for something"
