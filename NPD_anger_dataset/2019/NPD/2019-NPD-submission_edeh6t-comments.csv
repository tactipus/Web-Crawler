fbiiawj,t3_edeh6t,For me the holidays are spent with a lot of family i otherwise never see. It's just so fucking stressful being around a bunch of people I essentially see as idiots. (I actually have a theory that the only reason I think I'm smart is that my family are dumb as fuck lol.) You can't have any interesting questions with any of them and someone is always crying or angry or both. But everyone pretends it's all good and we have no problems at all. This whole situation stresses me to the fucking max and I act like a prick. I cant realize I'm fucking up til it's too late and I've messed up xmas again.,t3_edeh6t
fbhsnbr,t3_edeh6t,"I don't have NPD or virtually any of the traits but my mother is diagnosed AsPD and my sister has borderline.

For me and my sister, we get stressed and highly vulnerable around the holidays because our mother made every holiday this huge fucking affair, she would scream and yell at us to get everything ready and she would cry if we didn't do it exactly as she said and get angry that she didn't have a ton of money. Then she would flip and pretend everything was sunshiney golden when we had guests.
So, our mother created an environment of stress and awful that is relived, cos of cptsd (ptsd but for multiple traumatic events, not just a single). 
Pain in the ass!
Possibly similar depending on the type of childhood you had.
I'm not sure how much is nature vs nuture for NPD's but childhood trauma is a pretty god damn big factor there. And one that is unfortunately very common amongst PD's.

Edit: screwed up a spelling.",t3_edeh6t
