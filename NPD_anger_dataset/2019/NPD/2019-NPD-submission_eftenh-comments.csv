fc2d5vu,t3_eftenh,"This sort of thing doesn’t necessarily affect us only- good people can feel smothered, too. Maybe it’s just a regular boundary thing.",t3_eftenh
fc2mfbg,t3_eftenh,"Try to talk about it, I thought it's impossible n ppl gonna run away or think I'm rude but turns out asking for a bit less phisical contact or telling them when you really want to feel but you can't really or you don't understand why they do something or you don't know how to deal with their emotions or stuff. Your relationship ll be more real like honest n less like a play w pre written characters.

And I'm still learning this. But like there was a girl w bpd and it was super surreal like I can't handle ppl who are close and i don't remember a lot of stuff cuz we changed so much but I know that she went on about how much I mean to her n I told her that I can't believe it n whenever I hear it it feels like a lie and I'm afraid to say it cuz I don't want to hurt her and I'm not sure I mean it or just want to believe it. N she slowed down n we talked about it and I understood that I feel the same too.

I also told her when I wasn't able to care about her but I really wanted to and she told me about so much, she never dated to tell anyone so it was bloody Scarry for both of us but it helped a lot. (Also I have mayor memory problems, I don't really remember my childhood maybe for good but she brought back a bunch of memorys and I was at a place where I was able to deal with em)

So moral of the story try to be honest, you probably won't manage to be honest about everything at first but you'll get better, and the other person will be more comfortable around u and you can work on stuff together. I really believe in u and really hope it gonna work out",t3_eftenh
fc2f908,t3_eftenh,"I think you are being very kind trying to find a way to cope with this other person's lack of respect for your personal space. I personally find it interesting that you ""don't want to dip""; do you know why? 

In any case, it is important for your mental and emotional health to be able to set boundaries. Compromise is good in relationships, and there is give and take. But I think your need for personal space is not really one of those things that you should force yourself to compromise on. Not only will it cause problems in the future when you cannot take it anymore and maybe end up exploding towards them or hurting them with a shocking statement of ""stop touching me"", but this sort of thing is likely to lead to resentment.

One of the things I've noticed while helping my partner navigate his NPD is that it's difficult for him to delineate between things that are okay and not okay. For example, I tried to explain once that it's perfectly normal to be attracted to/aroused by other people, but lying about it creates a profound feeling of doubt in me because I begin to wonder if there is a deeper reason for the lie. The next time we went out he pulled me aside and told me that he found the group of women at the table next to us very attractive 😂 Of course I understood what he was trying to do, but I had to sit him down again and explain to him know that he doesn't have to tell me. Just, don't LIE about it. And of course I knew he would find them attractive - they were his type, and I was checking them out too. Telling the truth does not equal telling me everything without prompting. This is only one example of this difficulty to grasp the point. The most comforting aspect is his eagerness to do better. Even when he takes it in a completely strange direction/interpretation, at least he is trying very hard.

I don't know if this is the reason you are seeking a way to deal with this situation, an attempt to not let your NPD control your reaction. I applaud you sincerely if it is. My suggestion would not be try to find a way to accept this person's touchiness, but open a dialogue about it instead. In this case, your friend ought to respect your wishes rather than the other way around.

The hardest part about this is, of course, doing it in a way that won't hurt their feelings or trigger an emotional response from them that in turn triggers rage or a shut down from you. One of the absolute hardest things for my partner to do is to talk about his feelings, or find a root to his behaviour and discuss it BEFORE it gets out of control. If you'd like to try talking to this person, I suggest spending some time reflecting on WHY you have this personal bubble, and what exactly it is that your friend does that you dislike. Then find a way to word it in a way that is vulnerable rather than demanding/complaining/blaming, and a way to ask for a different sort of physical relationship between you two. 

Make sure that this person knows that you want them in your life, you are afraid that voicing this will make them feel like you don't, and that you are taking a chance by discussing it. Maybe that you aren't good at this sort of thing. Appeal to their empathy, because you night make a blunder in speech here and there. And if they feel protective and concerned for you, they may be less inclined to find criticism and meanness in your conversation.

I don't know if this helps. I just want you to know, boundary issues is something everybody struggles with. I hope you are able to find a way through this tough situation!!",t3_eftenh
fc4ychv,t3_eftenh,"Yeah I hate it when I get smothered by people with excessive amounts of admiration or other types of positive attention. For example from my mother or my colleague (both codependants). Like you I feel smothered. 

I've read that it can be quite invalidating. Say something positive happens for me,  then my colleague is being excessive about it ""omgomgomg that's amazing!!!"" It's hiddeous and that's not how I feel, I'm just happy and glad. So I feel invalidated by their reaction because it is different to mine. A supportive colleague would say ""good for you"" and let me enjoy my wins.

So yeah I completely understand where you're coming from man. Even my therapist wasn't quite on the same page on this one with me. I reckon she is borderline, bless her.",t3_eftenh
fc2rz1h,t3_eftenh,"I read the first couple of sentences and thought, ""I bet the person giving attention has BPD"". I hate being the ""Favourite Person"" of someone with BPD because it comes with a lot of emotional obligation and that taps into my panic and empathy issues. I once had a woman who had BPD come to my home who I was trying to establish a friendship with, she got really drunk and kept trying to hug me and tell me I'm her favourite person. I asked her to leave and haven't spoken to her since. I don't get on well with people with BPD because I find it hard to accept their constant displays of very heightened emotion and I know personally I'm not good for them either because I tune out the noise a lot, people with BPD need a lot of validation in the form of a constant supply of empathy and reaction to drama and that's absolutely nothing I can safely deal with without lashing out so I can't do that to either myself or the person with BPD.",t3_eftenh
fc2s3jd,t3_eftenh,"Also when a person with BPD constantly flatters you and idealises you, you know it's only a matter of time before the splitting happens. My sister has BPD and I love the absolute bones of her and really do have a lot of empathy for her because we had the same upbringing and I know what she's been through, but at the same time when she goes through a phase of calling me constantly and doing everything she can to make me feel like I'm special, I'm always wary that within a week or so she'll hate me because I didn't reply to a facebook message quick enough and that makes me extremely angry. I don't like being given emotional jobs I did not consent to, but that could be more because I have ASPD.",t3_eftenh
fc34x7d,t3_eftenh,"Yeah that is more along the lines of it. Flattery is fine, and I don't have a problem with touching when it's something sexual, but the intimate, loving gestures physically, repetitively, just make me feel smothered.",t3_eftenh

fcf2btg,t3_eftenh,"You do not like attention from the wrong kind of people.

You DO like attention from the RIGHT kind of people.

Simple example for a male: your ideal hot chick : her polar opposite

Which one would be a chore to tolerate even for 5 minutes, which one would be a dream and an hour with her would feel like 5 minutes?",t3_eftenh

fc37ywj,t1_fc2mfbg,"Empath here, I want to thank you for sharing these thoughts. My father struggled mightily with BPD and towards the end of his life (he had recovered tremendously through years of therapy) would tell me, ""son, you are only as sick as your secrets.""",t3_eftenh

fc33nj0,t1_fc32q3w,"There are different types of attention. Flattery and desire and admiration are different from sexual or abusive attention. ""I want attention"" does not mean they want the negative attention of the authorities for example. I'm making extreme points here just for illustration; I imagine that for OP, the attention they seek out is not the physical clingy hugging attention that they receive from their friend. 

Of course I may be wrong, but I'm wondering why you would ""call out"" someone on here. Are you a troll, in that you seek out negative responses and get your kicks from putting people down and causing reactions of hurt and shame? Not that OP would feel that over your little ""SMH"" lol, but it just seems senseless unless you have some sort of vendetta or enjoy causing arguments.",t3_eftenh
fc34qwa,t1_fc32q3w,"I made this post because I do care about the person and wanted to know if I was in the wrong or they were. Nothing to do with attention, I've accepted that I can be better as a person, and it's hard to define what I need to work on and what boundary I need to push. 

Nice try though. See what you did there.",t3_eftenh

fc3emcw,t1_fc38ijj,"You did not get the love and respect that you deserved 🙏 

It does! You are being very giving when you are honest. It invites trust, compassion and patience not only from others but for yourself. It is an act of self love but it takes courage, these I think are traits of healthy narcissism.

Thank you again for sharing. I applaud your courage.",t3_eftenh
