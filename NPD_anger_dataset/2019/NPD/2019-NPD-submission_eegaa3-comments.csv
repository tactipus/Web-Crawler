I imagine you'll get a lot of polarized responses to this question.

I for one hate it because I'll never win at it. It acts as validation for a time, but then I just see some hot girl on insta with half a million followers because shes hot and it makes me irrationally jealous. But this is just an expansion of the basic theme outlined above.",t3_eegaa3
fczl2oa,t3_eegaa3,Only time I use IG is to post. I NEVER look at other people's profile. I get so fucking depressed even if I'm doing better then they are.,t3_eegaa3

As I always tell my therapist regarding social media:
“As long as the only thing I see is my reflection in the mirror, no one can convince me that someone is better than me”.",t3_eegaa3
