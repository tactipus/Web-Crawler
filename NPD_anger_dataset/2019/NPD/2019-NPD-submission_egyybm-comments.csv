fcbd6o0,t3_egyybm,"I relate to this a lot. Having that ex that loved you in spite of your flaws and still not seeing it. Not *getting* it. Treating them like shit but telling yourself it's normal. And then questioning if you're really a bad person.

I really empathize (hah) with the desire to reach out and tell them how blind you were and that you think you get it. But that's not fair to them. I can't talk much because I would give it all to be able to talk to that ex of mine. But they are truly better off without us, even if it means vilifying us forever. 

Our egos don't want to let that be true, to leave the last perception of us in the eyes of a loved one as a monster. But it's not up to us. Sometimes we just have to accept that we truly broke someone's heart and we can't fix that. It's heartbreaking itself. But it's nothing compared to the pain we have caused some of these loved ones. All we have is now. And to try to be better and not hurt anyone else.

Keep working on yourself and moving forward.",t3_egyybm
fcbccvj,t3_egyybm,"Thanks for sharing. Like the other person said, you are not alone. Along with my NPD, I think I’m lazy. I wish my lady friend would just dump me.",t3_egyybm
fcbur6n,t3_egyybm,"*I believe I meant it, but I always believe I mean it. Then again I've  offered serious genuine apologies this year so maybe I'm getting better.  I hope so.* 

I really relate to this, especially with the doubt on being genuine and doubting my motives.  Being self-aware means doubting so often and learning to ""trust myself"" whatever that means. The mutable identity thing is stressful at a very deep level and not something I can well explain to others, so thank you for sharing this here.",t3_egyybm

fcbdzck,t1_fcbd6o0,"It''s also hard when people love you and you end up thinking they are stupid or weak for not seeing through the ruse.

Well, I ended up sending a short apology after saying nothing for 2 weeks. I really struggled and wanted to make sure it came from a good place. Can't undo it now, and if I'm vilified that's fine but I also didn't want her to, I don't know, it felt like her world might be a little darker without something. Not hope exactly. I can't explain it.

Thanks for your response. Incredibly relatable.",t3_egyybm
fciw21p,t1_fcbd6o0,You can fix it a little bit if you apologize. I’m not a narcissist but I’m broken by one. And having that last image of him as the worst person I ever crossed paths with is indescribable painful. I would give my right arm for him to reach out and acknowledge the hurt he caused me by ghosting me out of the blue. It’s closure and healing and that can’t be bad. Even a short apology could make a broken heart feel better.,t3_egyybm
fcbvdj8,t1_fcbccvj,"such a strange thing to wish someone would dump you. I feel the same way about my partner sometimes and I think its because I am 1) a coward 2) believe that I deserve it. 3) have a fragile ego and dont want to admit that I am wrong.

What a mess it is combined. :/ Similar for you?",t3_egyybm
fcdzdh9,t1_fcbur6n,Mutable identity....nail on the head. I get that. Developing a real identity and discovering my motives has been insane. It's like meeting someone for the first time. It also feels like I've gas lit myself this whole time.,t3_egyybm
fcds6mo,t1_fcd8lu2,"Edit: not going to entertain this. This isn't the sub for it.

Did you even read all the good shit I wrote, what the fuck, I did not need to wake up to this fuckery. This is not your sub. This is our sub. I didn't try to emphasize the getting better part because it's a vent, and most people here are active in a variety of forms of therapy. As in, I don't find a need to look shiny, good and digestible for the masses. This isn't for shiny feel good shit, this is real shit.

So idk and idc who you are or who hurt you, but this kind of shit sets me back. Fortunately I can smoke a lot of CBD and calm down but not before writing this out.

Why the fuck do I have a hard time talking about my issues? Because even in a sub by people with NPD FOR people with NPD I still wake up and read this asinine fake-curious drivel. Reported. Checked your post history too.

You need to check your morbid curiosity. Go to r/narcissism, I left that sub because of shit like this.

This hurts us more than it helps. It places that ""otherness"" onto us. I cut out my narc mom so I'm pretty aware of the pitfalls of NPD. 

Seriously. What the fuck.

I come to this sub to honestly vent and know people have enough implied context that I don't need to be a well behaved narc for the pony show. I don't want to come here and watch what I say because that's every waking moment of my fuckin life.

I can't believe you have the gall to come in here and be like ""why do narcs do (insert crucial part of disorder)"". What I find curious is how people who allegedly know enough about NPD don't seem to understand why they may not ""get"" the parts of the disorder that sets us apart and makes us disordered.

Would you go into a PTSD sub and say ""gee, I am just so fucking innocently curious about HOW people with PTSD can become violent in response to simple things????""

I don't go into narc abuse subs and be like, guys, I find it really curious how you can't move the fuck on and why you're hurt.

Jesus. 

And yeah, I'm a little pissed off because it never ceases to amaze me how fucking entitled you sorts are.",t3_egyybm
fcbfgro,t1_fcbdzck,"Yes, it's like you can't win with yourself. That feeling that everyone who likes you is dumb because you're clearly a piece of shit, but anyone who dislikes you just doesn't ""understand you."" It's a convenient mechanism to never have to care about anyone. But it fucking sucks. 

It's like, what is left? It makes you really feel alone. And then the ones who do love you are forced to feel alone too because you just can't keep that gap bridged. Sure, sometimes there is genuine connection. But it always falls short in the long term as we slide back into our Narcissistic hole. As I said earlier in another post my general feeling towards this ends up being suicidal but I'm trying my best to fight it.

As for the apology I don't think it's a bad thing. To be honest it's okay to do it for yourself too. If that's part of you healing your narcissism then I say go for it. Her response is her own means to handle, it negative or not. I think it's actually admirable to be able to claim your flaws and let her know that she didn't do anything wrong, so long as you're not trying to get anything out of it (praise, reconciliation, etc.)

I think a lot of us here are really looking to be better people. It's hard when we aren't really sure what to do or where to go. But I will say, some of the most relatable conversations I have had are with others like you on this subreddit. It's nice to know I'm not truly alone. Thanks for the reply.",t3_egyybm
fcj1aqq,t1_fciw21p,"I think all cases are different unfounately, as with my ex I can tell she genuinely hates me but not for any unjustified reason. I simply earned the reputation of distrust and disgust through my behavior so I'm not sure she would even take any of my apologies as genuine.

You've made me rethink it though, as if I can help heal any pain, I want to",t3_egyybm
fcbwi5a,t1_fcbvdj8,"You have described my scenario well. Although I don’t experience empathy in the same way as she, I’m not so out of it that I don’t understand how some of my actions or inactions are hurtful.",t3_egyybm
fcd6iq8,t1_fcbvdj8,I had these feelings forever for the same reasons. The belief of deserving it combined with cowardice of not being able to talk about it just let it fester inside forever. I ended up cheating on her and then telling her and imploding everything. Definitely not the right way to handle it,t3_egyybm
fcfc3q6,t1_fcds6mo,"I wish I could upvote this more than once. You said everything I was going to say, but better. This person can fuck off back to the abuse subs. The last and least productive thing you wanna do is criticize somebody who has NPD when they’re actively trying to evolve. Fuck this person. God this pissed me off so much. As someone who is currently (successfully, loving, and happier than ever) in a 12 year long relationship with a partner who has NPD, this post is so relatable and made me well up a bit. You’re doing great.",t3_egyybm

fce09ms,t1_fcbfgro,"Hearing that apologizing can be good for healing narcissism made me feel better. I had some of my worst narc moments with her and I'm not sure I could recover without addressing the issues (which I mostly did without her). I don't need or deserve anything from her but she hasn't blocked me for some reason so I didn't block her.

And yeah, you aren't alone. There's dozens of us haha. I think the way from here is integration, whatever that may mean to folks.",t3_egyybm

fcego0a,t1_fce58mu,"Not an NPD sufferer: OP is right. This is a forum for people seeking help and community to deal with a difficult, poorly-understood condition.

I lurk here because seeing the genuine thoughts of people with NPD helps me understand what they are going through and what their relationships mean to them. There isn't, since r/narcissism became an adjunct to r/npdabuse or whatever, any other forum where I can gain this insight. More crucially, there isn't anywhere else for people with NPD to get support from fellow travellers.

You've come in to, as OP has pointed out, muse - pointlessly - on why NPD sufferers appear to lack empathy. Like, d'uh. You haven't been respectful. There's nothing in your post which isn't a dig at people you actually don't know. Also, your non-apology ('I'm sorry you feel that way') doesn't at all express any empathy on your part.

Finally, this is very clearly and specifically a forum for people with NPD. It says as much in the info for the sub. I'm chuffed i get to lurk, and I would hate this community to disappear because it becomes flooded with comments and posts by people with axes to grind. There are plenty of places to do that already.

Mods, sorry for interrupting. I will resume silent lurking immediately.

OP, good luck. We can't change the past but we can all aim to make a better future.",t3_egyybm
fce7rkx,t1_fce58mu,"Don't tell me my emotions are misplaced. Do not fucking tell me how I feel. And it was definitely directed at you.

""Innocuous speculation"" my fucking ass. You literally highlighted one of the most talked about narc traits. 

You weren't respectful. You dismissed my more salient points. I don't even know why you're here. You aren't a narc and you had a post removed for bitching about narcs.

Also, if you aren't surprised by my outburst, maybe you shouldn't have said anything at all.",t3_egyybm
