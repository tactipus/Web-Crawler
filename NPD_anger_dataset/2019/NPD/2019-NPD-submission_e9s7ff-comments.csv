fan5ygt,t3_e9s7ff,"Please destroy the idea that only the “golden child” gets NPD.
NPD, just like any other personality disorder, often stems from childhood trauma.
I was emotionally, physically and sexually abused and also emotionally neglected. Guess what? I still developed NPD that was severe enough to almost ruin my life. On the contrary, my sister who was the “golden child” developed BPD.",t3_e9s7ff
falffgz,t3_e9s7ff,Yes absolutely. I was abused by a narcissistic father and a borderline mother. Now I meet the clinical criteria for both NPD and BPD. What a shocker lmfao I have to laugh,t3_e9s7ff
famupks,t3_e9s7ff,No I didn't really go through any trauma and wasn't really abused but I just feel like I was neglected alot my parents just didn't interact with me much and so I'm extremely distant with them also I didn't have any meaningful relationships or friendships in school while growing up but I still got diagnosed recently.,t3_e9s7ff
famep1q,t3_e9s7ff,"abused as in childhood? not that i can remember or identify. abused as in bullied or harassed? yeah, all throughout middle school and some highschool. bottom line, anyone can be abused including narcissists. whether it’s bullying, childhood abuse or neglect, relationship abuse, etc. it can happen to anyone, we are no exception.",t3_e9s7ff
fao2w46,t3_e9s7ff,I wasnt abused per se but my therapist helped me to see that my childhood was abnormal and my parents neglected me and my brother. It makes a lot of shit make more sense.,t3_e9s7ff
faw55mo,t3_e9s7ff,"I was the scapegoat to a NPD and BPD mother and I ended up with ASPD with NPD traits. The scapegoat golden child narrative is just more pop psychology bullshit and the chance you have of developing NPD depends on the kind of abuse you received, for example ASPD is more consistent with violent abuse.",t3_e9s7ff
fb9sea2,t3_e9s7ff,It is pretty common.,t3_e9s7ff
famutn9,t3_e9s7ff,"Definitely emotionally abused by my mother and step father throughout my entire childhood from 3 years old onward. I left them at 17 to live with my father and started to get a little better.

As an early teen I was also in a heavily emotionally abusive relationship that I still have trouble going over in my own head. It triggered a massive depression for me that lasted a good year or two.  

I think it resulted in me having severely stunted personality growth. I still feel the mental scarring 7 years later, couldn't even bring it up to my previous girlfriend for fear of being ostracized",t3_e9s7ff
fdqrwpd,t3_e9s7ff,My parents were normal. I was bullied abit in middle school nothing major though.,t3_e9s7ff
faw58if,t1_fan5ygt,Same. Golden child sister has BPD. Scapegoat me has ASPD with NPD traits.,t3_e9s7ff

fbddjs9,t1_fb9shrb,"People can have been abused / be abused and also abuse other people. In fact, having been abused makes it more likely for a person to become an abuser through stuff like maladaptive coping mechanisms (eg. borderline's efforts to avoid abandonment through push and pull relationships) for example",t3_e9s7ff
fb9tutm,t1_fb9shrb,"Hokey pop psychology and ""self -help"" books geared towards the ""friends"" and family of (un)diagnosed narcissists and how to wage domestic guerrilla war against them or something lol. Sure, narcissists are frequently manipulative abusers. But where does abuse come from? It does not just come out of a vacuume. It is often is learned behavior. And that is unfortunately. It can be generational. Sure, there is a certain type of narcissist who was given everything, and expects to get whatever he wants, and will abuse others who don't give him that and go along with his facade. But for many others, their fake self is just a mask for the real, fucked up and abused person who has been dealing with chaos throughout life. They do it to others in turn.   


Get this: I would pre-emptively cheat on women. You know, because you cannot trust them. So if I found someone new, even if I really liked her, and perhaps especially if I really liked her, I would find someone else to roll around with. Might get bored of the first one and take a vacation from that relationship to enjoy my lover girl for a week and then hightail back. I did not think of that as abusive but it was. Now I see. And I saw that I had no justification for it. I just assumed that women my age were liars and they wanted to use me for their own pleasure and find a place to sleep and smoke dope away from their even more fucked lives. 

And I wound up with women who had traits of my own abusive mother! Neat. Married a BP, one who turned out to be the most abusive woman I;ve ever met. There were more.",t3_e9s7ff
