fbm3y63,t3_edyaag,"If a narcissist did this on a place like r/raisedbynarcissists they‚Äôd get banned minutes later, and it‚Äôs happened multiple times before. NPD mods gotta keep up",t3_edyaag
fbmmka8,t3_edyaag,"I‚Äôm a victim of a Narcissist, not a sufferer of NPD and it‚Äôs important that it‚Äôs said from a perspective like mine: 

This is not an appropriate place for this. It‚Äôs unfair, especially to the people with NPD who are actually trying to get better. 

Please get the help you need. Bashing people here is not the answer. They are never going to give a stranger sympathy when it‚Äôs presented this way anyway, or at least it‚Äôs very unlikely. 

I‚Äôm sorry your head is spinning with grief and suffering but there are many places on Reddit that can help you. This is not it.",t3_edyaag
fbm66vj,t3_edyaag,User bant for threatening others. Keep it civil please!,t3_edyaag

fbm460o,t3_edyaag,"First of all, this sub is for people with NPD only.

Secondly, if this is such a strong trigger, I seriously suggest you stay away from even the mention of narcissism let alone a sub run by narcs, **for** narcs. 

I was also abused by a narc. Horribly. Many people here were. It isn't fair to you **or** us to enter a specific part of the Internet specifically quarantined so we don't have to hear what pieces of shit we are.

I went no contact with my narcissistic mom 2 months ago because I got sick of being called a piece of shit. I got banned from a sub today because I even dared to mention having traits of narcissism.

I have suffered abuse multiple times at the hands of the abused. Do not continue this cycle.

Edit: also I'm in a bad fucking mood and I have to stay level or else I'm another abusive asshole in your eyes. You ALSO just told someone to kill themselves",t3_edyaag
fbm3szv,t3_edyaag,"It's weird how emotional and oversharing you come across, I think you yourself have massive issues, which is not an accusation btw, just a pointer. At least you apologized AFTER FCKN PROMISING TO MAKE A LIST AND HUNT US DOWN hahaha. Thanks for the entertainment.",t3_edyaag
fbm5gwm,t3_edyaag,"Yeah because of people like this some of us  rage and act out , this seriously triggers tf out of me",t3_edyaag
fbm4hla,t3_edyaag,Holy shit you're still yelling at people.,t3_edyaag
fbmd43e,t3_edyaag,Idk the backstory but your making terrible comments to people in other subs. Are you acting like a troll or just a troll period?,t3_edyaag
fbm38nk,t3_edyaag,"Literally nobody here cares. We don‚Äôt like people like you. You add to our stigma. Take your business elsewhere, and stop playing the victim even after you claim to see the ‚Äúerror of your ways‚Äù. It‚Äôs annoying.",t3_edyaag
fbm38n7,t3_edyaag,I understand,t3_edyaag
fbm3ltb,t3_edyaag,It happens! Appreciate the apology. Best of luck on your healing journey.,t3_edyaag
fbm5jbr,t1_fbm3y63,"Kinda tempted to post screenshots of this lunacy in raisedbynarcissists.....

Also they just told a narc to kill themselves nice",t3_edyaag
fbm4v8z,t1_fbm3y63,"Tbh, I went through a phase of wanting to go guns blazing to that sub but realized I would just get deleted and banned without getting any supply I mean responses.",t3_edyaag

fbm568p,t1_fbm4v8z,I learned the hard way lmao. They really don‚Äôt give a fuck about anyone else but themselves over there. Also if you want some entertainment look at OP coming at me with the ‚Äúkill yourself‚Äù comments on my page lol,t3_edyaag
fbm6j8b,t1_fbm62g1,Would y‚Äôall be accepting new mods because it seems understaffed lol,t3_edyaag
fbm4kt6,t1_fbm41pc,"I doubt it, I am covert and only devaluate people psychologically (*and want to stop doing it*), if your story is real I have never assaulted a woman (or anyone) like that. But really, no harsh feelings, you did provide me entertainment while I couldn't sleep so thanks.",t3_edyaag

fbm3rmj,t1_fbm3jc3,"I wasn‚Äôt even here for it, kinda wanna see screenshots now that I think of it lol",t3_edyaag
fbm5ho9,t1_fbm4bmt,"I am cringing so hard at even attempting to write to you. I know you are very angry right now, but just as you would immediately dismiss or tell a person to GTFO who threatened to kill you inside your safe place, it should be no surprise that there are some people who are upset at what you wrote. I'm so sorry for what you went through...I can't even imagine the hospitalization part. But please bear in mind that a lot of narcs are going to be abusive to the mind and heart and I don't think anyone here has stomped someone's head 50+ times for being called out on their lies. I am the partner to a narcissist, and I have also suffered for it, but he hasn't ever abused me physically. Before he began his very hard journey to becoming a more empathetic and self aware person, he would just completely shut down and nothing I said or did would touch him, and he's be mean if I called him out, and he ghosted me three times. Never did he hit me. Please understand that you were abused by a person, not a disorder. In the end, we are all responsible for ourselves. Letting your past partner get away with blaming his NPD for what he did to you is not taking responsibility, and blaming your PTSD for the death threats and cruelty you posted here tonight is definitely not taking responsibility. If you are fresh off from this relationship (in the last two years because fuck, it takes forever to overcome this kind of shit) then please desist before you say more that you might regret later. Please, stop, and think. Try to understand where they may be coming from after you threatened to kill all of them for having a mental disorder and seeking companionship in a place where they can go and talk about the things they do and how they try to be better with people who might be able to relate. Please, try to use that empathy you were gifted with naturally that they have to strive so hard for. And if you can't at the moment, please step away from this and stop reading the responses.",t3_edyaag

fbm4nnl,t1_fbm4bzw,"Yeah this person definitely has issues, you literally didn‚Äôt say anything wrong ü§î",t3_edyaag
fbm45zz,t1_fbm3rmj,"Basically said we all deserve to die, aren't capable of getting better, spew out narcissistic bs like robots, and that OP is gonna study us and maybe try to kill us all. Cuz OP has ptsd from an abusive narc she was with for years",t3_edyaag

fbm4kks,t1_fbm45zz,How‚Äôs that even forgivable? If that‚Äôs the case then this apology was useless and I don‚Äôt see why anybody would accept it. I mean take a look at the response the bitch just sent me. Talk about deranged.,t3_edyaag
