fap82a3,t3_ea9m5x,"I don’t have NPD, but I’m certain an ex was highly narcissistic if not NPD.

Honestly, I wish I knew. From my experience, at least from that relationship, it would take a certain type of person to be understanding of a NPD partner without falling apart or jumping ship. If I would have known, I wouldn’t have run, but it would have made some disagreements make a lot more sense before it was too late and I could have managed my own responses better for the sake of the relationship.

I can totally understand why someone with NPD wouldn’t want to tell someone. It’s highly stigmatized. But if someone with NPD is hoping to have a successful lasting relationship, I think they deserve that chance, it’s just going to be much more difficult with partners that don’t know what they’re facing.",t3_ea9m5x
faqfxz8,t3_ea9m5x,"I don't have npd. I dated someone I am pretty sure had it. I'm pretty sure everyone who ever liked me romantically had it and that my father and brother have it. 
If someone I was dating told me, I would want them to tell me what they're doing to work on it. And id want details and if want to see proof (naturally, and not faked or after I demanded it) and I'd want it to be consistent. 
It's like if someone told me they were a recovered alcoholic, I would expect them to be able to manage themselves without me breathing down their neck, or pretending it's not happening and not doing something. 
I am not a therapist, so I could easily be wrong. But this is what I'd want.",t3_ea9m5x
fapelu4,t3_ea9m5x,"You absolutely tell serious romantic partners about health issues, including mental health issues. 

Plus if you actually love someone, you would want them to know the truth. 

Imagine someone not telling you they are borderline or bipolar or ASPD...

Don’t be with someone you don’t trust in the first place. If you can’t trust anyone, you’re not ready to date.",t3_ea9m5x

faori1c,t3_ea9m5x,Just don’t bring it up,t3_ea9m5x
faoyfj3,t3_ea9m5x,You don’t.,t3_ea9m5x
fap9b5t,t3_ea9m5x,"If you trust the person you're with, you can definitely tell them. But it really depends on their nature as to whether or not they'll leave. You need to figure out what the aftermath will most likely be first before deciding to trust them. 

If you decide to tell them, maybe start off by outlining how it's a disorder that you can't really help.",t3_ea9m5x
fapja81,t3_ea9m5x,"This situation sucks. If you ride it out and you have NPD; it can and usually will royally fuck shit up (personal experience.) I've never heard of someone being able to control and handle this issue; hence why it's a mental illness. Try to be honest but in a smoother way than ""oh I have this thing that might make you view me as batshit."" Do therapy or psychiatry and move carefully. If there is love then compromise will fall into place eventually. Be open and honest but be serious and mature if you want it to work.",t3_ea9m5x
fbdczgs,t3_ea9m5x,"If you struggle to manage your symptoms and get manipulative then you should tell them. If your symptoms and behaviors are well managed it should be fine not to tell them you have NPD, but it could help to tell them about individual things you're struggling with",t3_ea9m5x
faqupad,t1_fap82a3,"I think the problem is lots of narcissists don't want to believe they are narcissists, and so there are a disproportionate amount of them ""flying under the radar""

In my previous relationship, had I known for sure I was NPD I would have made an effort to reach out. But I always assumed I was depressed/misunderstood. Took way too long to get to the point of openness. 

As for OP, I think there's no easy way. You have to approach it from the understanding that its a legitimate disorder, and that you are committed to changing it and finding ways to live and love around it. Many people will still run for the hills anyway, as its a scary thing to deal with at times. But that's life. Living with a disease or disorder is never easy.",t3_ea9m5x
faqpi7j,t1_faqfxz8,That’s very good advice. Thank you!!!,t3_ea9m5x
fapf0tz,t1_fapelu4,Yeah those were my thoughts too. That’s why I phrased it as a “when” question and not an “if”,t3_ea9m5x
faxysha,t1_faoquj9,"Don’t you think they have a right to know if they’re planning on being with you for a long time? To hide it and pretend like nothing is up is just going to make any conflicts as a result/ connected to the disorder that much more difficult. If they know, they can respond and act more accordingly to help support *you*, 

Does anyone really wanna be the ex-narc that left someone they cared about wounded and confused?",t3_ea9m5x
faqw4nc,t1_faqpi7j,"I think the fact that you're asking, and considering your partners needs is a good step. Keep it up.",t3_ea9m5x

fayphvj,t1_faxysha,"Giving a name to the symptoms does not help the conflicts, it just tells the partner that they will continue to happen. They will look up the disorder or tell others and get bombarded with, ""get out now! You don't want to be with a narc!""",t3_ea9m5x
