fckou4h,t3_ehpf2m,"Hello! You'll probably hear this a couple times before seeing your post removed but this is a subreddit for people who have NPD, not for the victims or observers of it. While your post is not abusive or degrading in any way that *I* can see, the rules still remain that only narcissists can post. Non narcs - like myself - can comment, but only narcissists can post here.

There are several places - a significantly greater number of places in fact - where people who have suffered or are suffering through interactive with narcissists can go to talk about their experiences. This place was created for the people who are wholly unwelcome in those subreddits. 

If you'd like, you can message me and we can talk a bit - I share this account with my partner who is a narcissist, and that is one reason I frequent this page. I don't have any answers for you, and I'm not exactly sure what you are seeking with your post, but I'm open to talking if you need to. 

Good luck to you.",t3_ehpf2m
