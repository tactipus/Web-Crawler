fbk5z1p,t3_edoy35,"Never been angry about it but I have felt disgusted when I hooked up with people I normally wouldn't. It's a shame thing is my guess. It puts a dent in the persona. *If I'm* ***so*** *attractive and perfect, why did I just fuck someone who's not even attractive to me?* Most people in that situation would feel some negative emotions but obviously NPD is going to amplify them.

The real issue is whatever led up to the hook-up. Sex should be simple. You want to fuck someone, they want to fuck you. So, you fuck and, if all goes well, it's fun since you both wanted to do it. If you never thought they were to your standards but did it anyway, I think that might suggest you feel like you need to prove something.  Alternatively, there's always the possibility that the standards are unreasonably high, so they have to be broken. Then you feel bad that you broke them.

But I'm not a therapist, psychologist, or anything like that. I've just had similar experiences and this is my guess.",t3_edoy35
