fb6f1sk,t3_ebmam1,Really good stuff! It’s so crazy how there is literally no information on this. It’s all the negativity about the narcissist and abuse but never really a space for people dwelling in the gray area. My guess is all of us seeking help are truly not full blow narcs. But it’s all semantics right? Thank you for getting the ball rolling on this. I’m looking to create my own blog as well. Thanks for the inspiration.,t3_ebmam1
fb6ocda,t3_ebmam1,"This is really awesome! A small piece of advice: I wouldn't put too much stake in the ""Elevate"" app, unless it does wonders for you. Other methods of modulating the default mode network can consist of: psychedelics, therapy, exercise, sleep (and sleep deprivation, although I wouldn't recommend it), and meditation (although some kinds of meditation have the opposite effect).",t3_ebmam1
fb6wrwd,t3_ebmam1,"Hi,  I want to commend you for taking action on , and going public with, your journey to healing your narcissism.  Even though I am fairly exhausted, being at the end of a long day,  I read through your blog and it came across pretty clearly as being written by someone who understands what their problem is and that they are sailing into largely uncharted waters in order to  heal themselves.  This is no small feat.

First , I must point out that I am a victim of NPD abuse and almost lost my life because of it.  Part of my own healing is to work with others who are victims of emotional abuse.  To help them as they figure out their own path to recovery.  On my journey I  have tried to learn as much as I could about NPD.  Why did they develop this way? The underlying causes.  Can they change and ""fit in"" with the rest of society?

You are absolutely correct in saying that there is very little information to be found about how one may heal from NPD or even where they might begin to make changes in order to do so.  And I don't need to remind anyone here that there is not a lot of love (or understanding) out there for NPDs,  especially from those who have been abused by one.  These are mostly people who have been deeply wounded and are lashing out at what they see directly in front of them.  I try to make sure that the people I help understand that NPD is a disorder,  brought on by childhood trauma (with some genetic help).  They did not choose to develop NPD; they are victims themselves.  It is the ultimate self defense mechanism,  with some very unfortunate side effects.  So, I just want you to know that some non NPD people do understand |that.

I like the approach you are taking with using citations and references to actual studies and published papers.  So much of what is put out there as help for victims of  emotional abuse is just click-bait, drippy, feel good crap that does not offer any real useful information about moving past the abuse and living life again.

Wish you the best in your healing and will continue to read your blog.  It was < interesting and enlightening so far.  Thanks.",t3_ebmam1
fb5vv14,t3_ebmam1,"As a way to hold myself accountable too, I am already sharing it.
It’s of course still heavily under construction.

Feedback is always welcome
Enjoy :)",t3_ebmam1
fb76nvw,t3_ebmam1,"Thanks for this.  I'm looking forward to reading it later.  I had a glance and it seems detailed, well thought out and positive!

I was wondering how an NPD support forum would really work.  Your blog seems to have got lots of positive responses which is exciting!",t3_ebmam1
fb89xd5,t3_ebmam1,"Don’t worry about perfection...you are doing a great job and you will get better as you go.  Just a thought...Would you consider putting a Q&A section on it for non-NPD people to ask questions to get your perspective?  Just wondering if answering questions from your point of view would help in  the self- discovery and healing process? I am not NPD and never even knew what it was; until I ended up with one.  I am also going through the healing process trying to understand why things turned out the way they did.  At first I hated the person for all the horrible things done to me. However, I did not like living with so much hate in my heart and slowly forgave this person. I now understand a lot of the things done were defense mechanisms. We do not associate with each other anymore...it is better that way for both  of us. It is what it is...we all have our demons we fight., so I don’t want to hate anyone...just trying to be more understanding and tolerant of people.",t3_ebmam1
fbfapli,t3_ebmam1,Nice!  I will check it out!  Hope your progress is still going well!  I admire your commitment!,t3_ebmam1
fe2lyh0,t3_ebmam1,"Update: I opened up to my friend. She is a smart lady too and together we are going to create a new website completely focussed on self help for narcissism. But more neutral. Since this method is working for me already so much, it’s something I feel can help us both in healing (she suffered from NPD abuse from her ex). Excited :)",t3_ebmam1
fb6vcv4,t1_fb6f1sk,"I spoke to a therapist about this, I was concerned I had undiagnosed NPD but she insisted that it has to be extremely pervasive to be a true diagnosis. And that most true NPD people will never seek treatment to begin with.

The way she put it, some of us have highly narcissistic tendencies we have developed. The key diagnosis comes into play when we are unable to make informed changes and decisions based on these tendencies. Seeking help is usually a good sign that your personality has not yet solidified.

Most of us here probably have a large sway towards these narcissistic behaviors. But I agree with her in the case that it is largely on a spectrum, and true diagnosis requires much more than just a feeling that we are full blown narcissists. 

It's difficult because we all identify with these traits and want help with them. But it is much more complex than simply identifying with certain traits and reaching a self-diagnosis. That's why professionals are necessary to clear the confusion. 

This doesn't mean to stop working towards self help and growth. But it should give us pause to how far gone we are.",t3_ebmam1
fb6ktro,t1_fb6f1sk,"Yeah it’s crazy right, I don’t understand it why there are so many self help books for NPD victims, but none for actual NPD’s. Doesn’t make sense to me. Anyway, thank you for your kind words, zi appreciate it. And tes, you should totally go for it! 
Try to make your life as stress free as possible and you should be able to handle it much better (from everything I’ve read/learned this seems to be key). Would love to read your story and progress :) best of luck on your journey",t3_ebmam1
fb7ndq8,t1_fb6ocda,"Sleep deprivation haha I need to look into that, never heard of it, seems dope. Have you tried the Elevate app yourself? I am new to it.
If so, how often and how long have you used it? Would love your insight on it. 
If you have any other ideas (mental exercises) on improving the Central Executive Network, apps, puzzles, websites or books, feel free to share. I feel that we can only learn from each other",t3_ebmam1
fb7bqt0,t1_fb6wrwd,"Thank you for your kind words. I am sorry you’ve been through so much and being so understandable at the same time. Takes great wisdom :)
Best of luck in your healing too <3",t3_ebmam1
fb6cshw,t1_fb5vv14,"Wow! I read your blog and it is great!  You have put a lot of hard work into this and are to be commended.  Good for you!  Three months of doing these exercises on a daily basis is a big commitment and you should be proud of yourself.  I don’t think I could do the same.  I want you to know what you are doing is fantastic...you see a problem and can’t find answers, so you are setting out to find your own answers.  Quite honestly, with such fine/tuned insight, are you sure you have NPD?  Are you diagnosing yourself? Or, has a licensed professional made that diagnosis?  Either way, I want you to be proud of yourself!  You have put a lot of work into this and you are clearly, trying to improvise your life.  Good for you!  I will continue to  read your blog and root for you!  Very well-done!",t3_ebmam1
fbdlfaj,t1_fb89xd5,"Ah, really seems like you’ve done a lot of work. Yeah I agree, in the end, living with hate isn’t something healthy. I think that when you find meaning in it, and learning from it is a way to give it a proper place in your head and actually heal. Seems like you’re really nearing the end process of grief and trauma healing :) I respect that a lot, it’s healthy.
I only had about 30 minutes, so I quickly made a Q&A page, seems like a good idea. I divided it into one for people with NPD, and one for without. 
This way maybe people without NPD feel more safe, I have difficulty seeing anothers perspective but this is what seems kind to me. 
And also people with NPD (diagnosed or not), acknowledging it in some way you have it, and writing on the page dpecific for people with NPD is a way of opening up, and that seems healthy to me too for their journey.
But if one page Q&A is seems better, feel free to share your thoughts on it.
Have a good day!",t3_ebmam1
fb6jhz4,t1_fb6cshw,"Hey Rachash! Thank you for your kind words :) I’ve updated the “about me” section after reading your questions a bit more in depth. But yes I got officially diagnosed 2 weeks ago by a specialised psychiatry center who only does diagnosing, so should be pretty accurate. Plus I completely agree looking back on all my behaviour. On your question of insight, I don’t really know any other way to put it, I am a scientist, so this is what I do by default everyday, really have no other way to explain it sorry. Hope that the text I added will explain it a bit further. Sorry it’s not perfect by any means, normally I always want things to be perfect so it annoys the fuck out of me, but I figured this is learning in itself right ;) I write as I go. I am a vulnerable narcissist btw. Used to be more grandiose, but got more vulnerable over the years and this had helped me I think to be more open and acceptive of situations",t3_ebmam1
