fbi5opt,t3_edj2zt,"I never thought of the possibility of taking CBD for NPD.  I currently take it for PTSD, but do have many covert narc traits, and am now wondering if it has been helping.

The main benefit for my PTSD that I notice is a less severe reaction to trauma triggers and a lessened startle response.  I could see this translating over to reducing irritability overall.

I know that I would love to read a research paper analyzing CBD and its possibility of reducing NPD symptoms, but I'm not holding my breath for one to be released.",t3_edj2zt
fbiniuj,t3_edj2zt,"I noticed when I was taking CBD I was much less irritable and reactive. However I just recently began a journey into sobriety and had a very constrictive addiction with marijuana in particular.

I have mixed feelings about using a cannabanoid at all after my addiction. I realize it is not psychoactive but I wonder if it would have any impact on my cannabanoid receptors and their ability to regulate my personality based on prior addictive tendencies. 

Still, interesting observation for sure. I'm gonna ask my sponsor and maybe give it a go again. I'll let you know how it goes.",t3_edj2zt
fbjln1n,t3_edj2zt,"I have tried: cbd tinctures, vaping and smoking. 

Tinctures kind of helped. Vaping did next to nothing. 

But a one hitter of cbd? A joint? Remarkable results. 

I have a long history of explosive violent reactions. I'm so much more calm. I've developed empathy. It's like a super power almost. It actually improves my happiness. I know a lot of folks here think empathy is weakness but real empathy isn't what people would lead you to believe. I have some interesting theories around this but it would take awhile to write up. Might make a post later.

So far Plain Jane is my favorite brand. They have a really nice selection. 

Here is a breakdown of my favorite products so far:

Plain Jane pre rolled joints (elektra): a hit or two and I'm calm. I don't fly into rages. I'm not sensitive to criticism. Love it. 

Plain Jane CBD pre roll cigarettes (all CBD, blend, 72 mg/cig): good results but I had to smoke 2 to really get the effects. I got the joints as a shortcut almost. The cigs are a bit heavy and sedative and for me are good for when I'm really flipped out. Like existentially. 

CBD flower (potent goat, CBD content unknown): hit in a one hitter. I use this almost like you'd take prescription pills. I take maybe 2 hits a day, usually closer to evening because I find it to be a bit heavier. Similar to the preroll cigs.

If I had to pick one product I would do flower in a one hitter. Joints only come in second because I don't smoke a whole one at once and that can get messy. If I get to the point I need more, joints will likely be my first line of defense. 

Notes:

* I definitely can get a body high from smoking cbd. Now I'm not sure if this is an actual high or just stress relief that feels so abnormal it feels like I'm high. I try to be careful while driving.

* clear thinking 

* better ability to be reasonable 

* enhanced self awareness that doesn't make me want to die/feel like a piece of shit 

* issues with explosive anger almost non existent 

* less issues w impulsivity 

* food tastes even better without getting the munchies 

As a note, I hate THC. I loathe smoking weed. It forces me to confront myself with no barriers. Cbd softens the barriers but doesn't eradicate them and make me want to die. I've taken quite a few drugs and cbd is the only one that is productive, stable and not a band aid.",t3_edj2zt

fbj0flv,t3_edj2zt,I really want to try it... I have to research and find who sells it,t3_edj2zt
fblxik1,t3_edj2zt,"Damn, this is awesome news, as I am trying to cultivate or get high CBD, low THC cannabis.",t3_edj2zt
fblxpy1,t1_fbjln1n,You get body high as in wobbling/lessened coordination?,t3_edj2zt
fcf453x,t1_fbj0flv,"Ebay. At least in europe... try to find the CO2 extracted one, it looks more transparent and watery, has the same effect but without the oil and lingering taste.",t3_edj2zt
fblxzd7,t1_fblxpy1,"The body high? Warm and sluggish, similar to taking opiates. If I smoke enough it can take a little longer for my eyes to focus. Slurring words not so much, not wobbly or less coordinated.",t3_edj2zt
fblycbz,t1_fblxzd7,I see... Would you say this would make you less productive during the day?,t3_edj2zt
fblyhqm,t1_fblycbz,The opposite. I'm less keen on satisfying impulses (because there are less) and staying entertained so I'm able to focus on learning or cleaning and I don't get bored or restless. The trick is always starting something though but that's a me problem,t3_edj2zt
fblymb4,t1_fblyhqm,Damn that's good news! Gotta try them CBD puffs :),t3_edj2zt
fblz16p,t1_fblymb4,"Hell yeah! I can see huge benefits for narcissism. My eyes have been opened. I have a fair amount of ASPD traits and it definitely helps those. The narc side is more about moderating my internal state. It's some crazy stuff. It's one of those ""helps narcs AND makes them feel better"" as opposed to ""helps you just fit in."" It isn't the be all end all, but I find it as helpful as therapy. Just works on a different set of problems.",t3_edj2zt
