fafpbf3,t3_e8yqx4,"I’m not going to watch that whole thing but from a 10-second clip I watched, maybe the discomfort is the camera being on him and his reactions while he’s not verbally communicating, and I’m guessing he’s used to speaking.

Also, and I truly mean this genuinely, which age group is he popular with? Today is the first time I’m hearing of this person and I have heard of them TWICE already.",t3_e8yqx4
fahmp3a,t3_e8yqx4,I'm pretty sure it's the root of mine. Lately I wonder if I ever really had social anxiety. I found out about social anxiety in my late teens and I felt like such a special little anxious victim lol. Spent the next 15 years in utter fucking denial about my growing narcissism.,t3_e8yqx4
faiigfd,t3_e8yqx4,"Didn’t watch the video but will watch it later.

Yah, I have social anxiety and I can’t carry a normal conversation. I don’t know how to be authentic and I have no social skills and I am a narc. I don’t really like how normal people can be socially normal while I’m not",t3_e8yqx4
fafewkn,t3_e8yqx4,Can you break down the thought process for those who can’t watch?,t3_e8yqx4
fagfb0c,t3_e8yqx4,"i don’t think he has narcissism. even if he did i would reject it, no way in hell am i associating myself with him in any way",t3_e8yqx4
fali4io,t1_fafpbf3,"He’s a child groomer- straight up. His primary audience is young girls (11-14), who’s bodies he was infamous for rating back in the day. Disgusting dude.",t3_e8yqx4
fafrcpq,t1_fafpbf3,"He is an influencer. He is on camera daily. There is actually a lot of drama around him, I have found.",t3_e8yqx4
faffr4g,t1_fafewkn,"In the video, there's this guy known as Onision (he's at this point well known as a malignant narcissist), he is supposedly talking to some fans consisting mostly of teenage girls, and there's this other British guy that is basically dominating the conversation, since Onision is no longer in the spotlight or the centre of attention, he starts to become pretty quiet, and seemingly upset as you can see it in his face, although he holds it in. People in the comment section were saying how he is afraid of other men dominating him, and usually only hangs around children due to that, never men his own age, and noticed how he uncomfortably sits back and quietly observing the conversation, trying to come up as to what to properly say next to appear normal.

Nonetheless, I felt so awfully relatable, because I feel and do these same exact things, the insecurities, and unable to be authentic, uncomfortable feeling when someone your own gender is dominating the group call and all attentions are on him instead of you, it somehow really bashes your ego, always see everything as a competition.",t3_e8yqx4
falib5u,t1_fagfb0c,"He’s definitely a narcissist. But honestly, I don’t feel that bad because narcissism is a spectrum. He’s clearly one of the worst ones out there, and what’s worse is that he’s unaware of how toxic he is.",t3_e8yqx4
fafj8rn,t1_faffr4g,"I used to be the same where I used to get uncomfortable when I wasn’t the center of attention. Instead of looking at it like a normal person I saw every second that I wasn’t in the limelight as an opportunity lost. I read way too into it. Actually as a way of managing my narcissistic behaviors I have forced myself to take on the role of a more quite person and listening and holy shit. It sucks to stay disciplined and quiet, but damn. When you aren’t making everything in the conversation about yourself you become soo much more likable!     

Can you explain the social anxiety connect?",t3_e8yqx4
falt4t9,t1_falib5u,yeah i guess. i just would like to really *not* be associated with him. if he gets diagnosed or comes out about it he for sure is gonna push the stigma through the roof.,t3_e8yqx4
fbm7xps,t1_fafj8rn,"I’m also interested in the social anxiety connect. OP, could you explain a bit? I’m really interested in hearing your ideas.",t3_e8yqx4
falu32j,t1_falt4t9,"Yeah that’s a really good point:( hopefully, he’s probably so delusional that he’ll never admit it",t3_e8yqx4
falv6pg,t1_falu32j,hopefully,t3_e8yqx4
