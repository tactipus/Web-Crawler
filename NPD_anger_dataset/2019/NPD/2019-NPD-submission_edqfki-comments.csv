fbk4fw2,t3_edqfki,">they’re trying to figure me out when they can’t.  They aren’t like me so they wouldn’t understand.

Hate to say this because it's such a narcissistic thing for me to single out, but I quit going for this reason. The best way I know to describe my therapist: she had a ""self-love"" cat meme framed on the wall. I'd show up half-dead after abusing speed for the third night in a row, wait in the lobby and wonder why I hadn't jumped off a bridge already, and then finally get called to her office. The first thing I always saw was that fucking cat meme. Talking to her, it was like she was nice to the point of naivety.

I'm going to try with someone else because, while I have gotten better at identifying my behavior, I need real solutions. It's too much for me to come up with on my own.",t3_edqfki
fblsf6c,t3_edqfki,"Does your therapist specialize in NPD? Your run of the mill therapist may not understand the gravity of what they are dealing with, and if they do that doesn't necessarily mean they are equipped to treat it. It's a different ballgame, no one can deny that.

You will get upset during therapy, that comes with the territory I think. Do you have DBT techniques learned to soften the blow of ego damage? That could be something you could work on if you feel you could.

You staying in therapy deserves sincere kudos, and from an objective standpoint it makes sense to stick with it despite the difficulty and frustration. Best to you.",t3_edqfki
fblt3jy,t3_edqfki,"*During* therapy I rarely got angry, but *thinking* about therapy made me angry and still does. These people charge a fortune and don't even force themselves to care about you, I have told them the craziest things and they didn't bat an eye, except one shrink that almost got me commited.",t3_edqfki
fbtcghl,t3_edqfki,"This would be a great conversation to have with your therapist because it sounds like you're experiencing transference and if handled well, you'll be happy that you brought it up even if it's incredibly awkward to.",t3_edqfki
fbtwtu1,t3_edqfki,"No, but that could be because my therapist is either unable or unwilling to push me to that point. I think therapy is good but that sounds really stressful. If it were me I'd get another therapist unless the breakdown can be used constructively in therapy.",t3_edqfki
fbw06ez,t3_edqfki,"If your therapist isn’t skilled in CBT and DBT, I wouldn’t recommend going to her. It’s obvious but people get quite offended at narcissists, so many therapists who aren’t skilled are going to go in your session with a bias against you. Someone who is really passionate about DBT would be far more understanding and empathetic.",t3_edqfki
fbkjri8,t1_fbk4fw2,"Yeah that’s why I left my old therapist, she was way too nice and never did any good for me. This newer lady I’m with is nice but she’s passive aggressive and challenging. At least I’m getting some things done with her though.",t3_edqfki
fbm3nn4,t1_fblsf6c,"She doesn’t, and I haven’t had her specifically for long (I’ve been to several over the years) so she doesn’t really know the severity of it. I don’t have DBT techniques either, I don’t really find them helpful from what I’ve seen and attempted. And Thanks, means a lot.",t3_edqfki
fbw1fb2,t1_fbw06ez,"Yeah I honestly don’t know what she specializes in. Could be CBT, but I doubt it. I used to be in CBT with my last therapist and this one doesn’t act like she did at all. Reason I left though was because we never really got anything done. We never focused on my NPD, just my other issues that weren’t having as much of an effect on me. Seems like this one won’t be that productive either.",t3_edqfki
