fb89b90,t3_ebzswv,Yep. Going on 6 years sober now.,t3_ebzswv
fb9355e,t3_ebzswv,"Relapsed so many times over the course of my life. 2 and a half years sober now, and can’t stress the importance of going to meetings where you feel welcomed and accepted. 

Remember even though we like to be the center of the universe, our stories aren’t all that different from the rest. Even “normal” people are broken, and it helps to hear some of the struggles others have faced with addiction, NPD or not.",t3_ebzswv
fb9uhet,t3_ebzswv,"Substance abuse is very common with NPD, I’ve definitely had my experiences with it. I’m sober now 6 months.",t3_ebzswv
fb9lkc4,t3_ebzswv,"Been struggling with addiction my whole life, just started my journey into sobriety.

36 days clean and sober, looking forward to more :)

For me AA made a huge difference. Don't be afraid to seek help from people who have been through it before. The biggest change for me was talking to other addicts and finding a group of friends that valued sobriety. 

It's really about enjoying your headspace. You come to like sobriety and start seeing the truth behind substances: they're an escape from pain. But the escape doesn't last. You have to build a support system for yourself that allows you to cope with pain and make healthy choices.

PM me if you ever need to talk about it! I'm very new to this so maybe we can share our experiences. It's scary but it's definitely the right choice. Takes a lot to even notice that, so good on you.",t3_ebzswv
fblnplq,t3_ebzswv,"Substance abuse yes. I guess I'm an addict but not of any one drug, although I was REALLY close to becoming an alcoholic if I wasn't already one. So I swore it all off.",t3_ebzswv
fb8arl8,t1_fb89b90,"Hi and well done on your recovery.  Thanks for replying.  Hope you're well today.

It's hard, isn't it?  I've slipped back into denial a few times.  About 7 years ago, I had a good go at recovery but I ended up spending my time in recovery with people who just helped me reinforce my distorted thinking and avoid responsibility.  I stopped a lot of my problem behaviours but I was still in the addiction mentally.  When I realised how little progress I'd truly made, my addiction escalated.

Hopefully I can stay with recovery this time, as I am learning to be vulnerable.  Although I keep thinking things like ""if it hadn't been for that fucking addiction then I wouldn't need to be vulnerable."" and even today, I slipped back into denial and started to dismiss and blame my former therapist.

Not sure if you want to talk about recovery or if you would find that unhelpful.",t3_ebzswv
