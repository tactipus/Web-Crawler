fb4w4ax,t3_ebeodn,"i don't know if i can help but i wanted to say that this incredibly noble.

if you have a friend or two that you can talk to about these things, try to have one available during the party for you to call if needed.

bring a pair of headphones. if you end up going for a walk, listen to some music that will calm and/or ground you.

needing to isolate will probably be more comfortable if you bring it up with the hosts beforehand. all they need to know is that holidays are difficult for you, you can easily be overwhelmed, and you don't want people to deal with the overwhelmed you. so if you suddenly get agitated for no apparent reason and have to bounce for a bit, you won't have the added worry that they're taking it the wrong way. if i were hosting, i'd set aside a room for you to go and chill in as an alternative to walking around outside in December.

>I am in need of a plan if I go over the top and my negativity and defensiveness destroys everyones holiday. I worry about leaving to a hotel alone or the like as other peoples holiday will alreadt be ruined.

it sounds like you're already on track for a Christmas that's better than your average. even if you ruin things, can you ruin them less than you have in the past? this post alone is a step in the right direction, as would be just one instance of catching yourself and not giving in to your emotions.

on that note, it might help with _next_ Christmas if you bring a tiny notebook to jot down things like what sets you off, unhelpful thoughts/emotions/reactions they've invoked, and anything you'd consider progress. next year (or whatever holiday comes up), use that to prepare and just try to beat your own record, with more of the stuff you're proud of and/or less of the stuff you regret.

fb4hehl,t3_ebeodn,What type of freakout are you prone to? Maybe think of certain routes you would like to steer conversations down so you avoid awkward topics,t3_ebeodn
fb7ppxj,t3_ebeodn,"Hmm interesting, you could ask your loved ones to use the SET communication method. It is used by people with Borderline personality disorder (also heavy/intense emotional responses). What SET stands for: Support, Empathy, Truth.
This is the least triggering way your relatives can deal with you. You can’t force them to do this in any way, but you can share it and they can use it if they wish. Overal it’s positive

What also works for me is to have a set if rules I can use and follow, knowing I don’t hurt or dissapoint people when having a moment. It all comes back to attachment style theory, that’s why we get triggered. 
I have found this great article that helped me implement the outcome of my emotions/ [activation of the attachmdnt system, emotion regulationand anxiety](http://arno.uvt.nl/show.cgi?fid=122764) 
Look at page 7.
Screenshot it and make it your phone background or whatever. 

If you look closely, you see that you only have to do 4 things, divided by first: not being a threat and second: being Available, Responsive and Attentive.

So for example someone says shitty things to you during xmas diner and wants a reply, and you feel anxiety hitting the roof and getting dismissive. 
Try to not be a threat in the very broadest term (passive agressiveness neither). And say you would love to talk about it because you care about them (maybe not in the exact moment, but long term you do) by saying: you have to leave & say that you come back to it later in an hour after you’ve walked or whatever you do to get rid of the anxiety/anger feelings. 
This way you Respond, are Available in an hour, and Attentive to their feelings by acknowledging that they matter to you.

There is a lot of science behind it. And I am assuming here you know about attachment styles, if not, I would start there first. Everyone has an attachment style, and there are only 4. It’s not restricted to humans, animals have it too. It’s what bonds us (or not bonds us).

Hope this helps anything. 
Best of luck though.",t3_ebeodn
fb4894n,t3_ebeodn,I find down time really important. Is your schedule really busy? If it is I would schedule in those breaks for meditation and not having to deal with people.,t3_ebeodn
