faik2q3,t3_e9en5k,"personally i feel like it’s everyone else who should fix their attitude towards us. i don’t feel shame for having NPD, i honestly feel more anger towards everyone else for saying that i *should* feel shame for having it. i’m not ashamed of myself or my behaviors, i’d say i’m more disappointed in society for rejecting it. i think we deserve more than we get.",t3_e9en5k

faktavd,t1_faik2q3,"That’s a new perspective for me, thank you. I’ve noticed that ever since I’ve received this diagnosis, the people who can see my medical record treat me a little differently.

It’s a very isolating disorder.",t3_e9en5k
faicy6k,t1_faicomz,I’m glad someone else feels this. I feel like there’s a lot of shame in the diagnosis,t3_e9en5k
faies93,t1_faicy6k,"That’s why I don’t share it with those around me. I feel the shame inside, though.",t3_e9en5k
