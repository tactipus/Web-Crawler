fadtdkf,t3_e8prx6,"If someone is talking about something and I dont have anything to add to the conversation, I'll literally just make shit up. I dont even realize I've lied until later.",t3_e8prx6
fadsqqg,t3_e8prx6,"i’ve lied about several mental illnesses to friends (that i don’t have, i guess it was to explain behavior maybe). i’ve fabricated abuse stories just for the hell of it (though at the time i guess they would count as delusions). but yeah when i lie for no benefit it’s either not serious at all or very serious.",t3_e8prx6
fafex6w,t3_e8prx6,"""I'm colorblind"" ""I hate lying""",t3_e8prx6
fdttfog,t3_e8prx6,I pretend to be a really bad liar. Whenever I tell a obvious lie I start smiling so ppl think I'm a really bad liar but when I want to tell a lie I don't smile and ppl believe it.,t3_e8prx6
fafiuxn,t3_e8prx6,Do any of you lie just for practice; to keep up the skill?,t3_e8prx6
faw6af7,t3_e8prx6,Same with the glasses! Although now I wear actual glasses and am overjoyed to get to legit wear them.,t3_e8prx6
fb7smb2,t1_fadtdkf,I do the exact same thing and for some reason people totally buy it and it emboldens my shitty behavior further,t3_e8prx6
fafgt3q,t1_fafex6w,HA I feel that last one.,t3_e8prx6
fdtuzgx,t1_fdttfog,Hahaha that’s actually brilliant.,t3_e8prx6
fafj11b,t1_fafiuxn,"Oh, definitely. Every time I lie I make sure to use the right words, time, gestures/body language, etc. It’s a skill but eventually it becomes second nature.",t3_e8prx6
fb7v3gl,t1_fb7smb2,"Same, same. Are you ever able to catch yourself in the act and shut it down? I disconnect from reality when im in social situations and go in default mode: pompous lying asshole lol",t3_e8prx6
fb7yxit,t1_fb7v3gl,"I realise what I'm doing, but at that point I'm too much into whichever character I've chosen for the day, to bother with anything else. Hence the pompous asshole liar streak continues, each time more believable and more elaborate than the last.",t3_e8prx6
