I “ruined” Christmas as I do every year, apparently. My family read into something I did as manipulative and we had a huge screaming match over it. Everyone but me has essentially quarantined themselves in another room and they’re all this close to killing me. I ruin everything I fucking touch.

Not to sound all BPD but I wish I could pull some sort of shit to get them to care about me again. I’m thankfully not suicidal but lowkey wish I was so I could attempt killing myself and garner sympathy. Maybe then they’d hate me less.

Merry fucking Christmas to me.",t3_efh4rm
fc169kf,t3_efh4rm,"I was determined to make Christmas miserable for everyone else because I only got a few hours of sleep and am sick as hell. I was able to check my behaviors and apologize and redirect my perspective and actually had a great day, even though I'm still miserable and feel like an entitled brat. It's hard holding both experiences in perspective at the same time but I'm trying.",t3_efh4rm

fc0adb3,t3_efh4rm,"Hey, thank you, you too eh?  I'm having a really good day so far - went no-contact with my mother almost a year ago.  She is similar to me in that she likely has covert NPD, but, unlike me, has zero self-reflection or metacognition on the subject.  

It feels so good to not have to deal with her this holiday season, and to have the new year to look forward to - it's going to be full of self-improvement.  Take care.",t3_efh4rm

Merry Christmas to all! And a happy Festivus for the rest-of-us!",t3_efh4rm

Also I really get the feeling, and for me it's good for my ego but than it just kicks back. So far I like low-key made peace w it, cuz I came so far, looking back so I do believe that it'll get better. 

Idk just try not to hate yourself when life sucks, it's not your fault you never asked for this, but changing it is your choiche, this sounds annoying as fuck, but just try not to treat yourself as an enemy it'll get better from than. 

Also just appreciate the fact that you want to care for them cuz than you can get there even if it sounds impossible rn ( I really hope at least, I mean I stopped being suicidal, everything can happen than). Also you can try to talk about it or write, draw do music, I often make up imaginery situations where I can care 4 ppl or conversations where I'm over the given problem.

And I'm still alone but it's a way less terrible alone than before (still not the best but babystepps I guess)",t3_efh4rm
fc0hpj1,t1_fc0feo5,"Thank you so much. I read every word but don’t have the energy currently to type a long response. It was absolutely a case of them misreading something, but I ended up blowing up  at them anyway for treating me as if I was being manipulative in the one time I wasn’t, so I own a part in it.

My reaction was full of rage especially when things escalated to everyone choosing to get away from me, because I was so frustrated and hurt that a simple thing that was not manipulative at all was misread and caused such a shitstorm. From there, my behavior was pretty aggressively angry and loud, but mostly because I felt so defeated by this diagnosis and because I felt like I could never do anything right by them. The one time I’m not displaying bad behavior they assume I am anyway. I get that my reaction was unnecessarily hostile but I was just mad that things happened all because of a misconception. The “you ruin every Christmas” statement, which I’ve heard countless times, was just the cherry on top.

Thank you again for such a kind and caring response. Judging by your username, you’re an empath. I wish all empaths were this nonjudgmental and loving.",t3_efh4rm
fc0ki9a,t1_fc0feo5,"Your username is spot on. This is a shared account between myself and my as-of-yet-undiagnosed NPD partner, so I'm in the same boat as you, watching the love of my life and so many people here struggling to overcome their diagnosis, their stigma, their shame, and their tendencies. I ache reading through these posts sometimes. From my point of view, your words are absolutely not out of line. Likely, they were very much needed. Keep talking, you empath supernova human.",t3_efh4rm
fc2r0e7,t1_fc2km11,"Nothing against people with BPD, I just didn’t want to give off the impression that I had it and not NPD since I was only diagnosed with NPD and my comment could have been misleading.",t3_efh4rm

fc0ovt8,t1_fc0m8tu,"No one is perfect. I am not referencing you as a person, or making a blanket judgment over one response to a post from someone who needed the kind words you provided. I didn't mean to make it sound like that. We've all done things we are not proud of, and as for reactive abuse....ah. I've done my share before I realized what it was doing to us, and to him. It is not a fair way to try to judge someone's progress. Now I have a word for it, so that's good. We are both learning as we go, and developing our own roughshod coping mechanisms and ways forward while we try to find the correct therapy. It isn't all on him, and reading your wisdom and your response really cemented that for me in a way that nothing has before. It is both of our responsibility. I take it on gladly. He is worth all the love I have, and more. I applaud you for your own realizations and ability to set firm and clear boundaries. I've been lucky in my life, in that most of my family is just kind of mildly neurotic. Although it left me wholly unprepared for the ordeals my partner and I have gone through before we were able to come to this place of awareness. 

We all need to vent, or release some of that anger/frustration/pain. I would never, ever judge anyone based on how they cope. I simply wanted to let you know that *I* thought your words were very kind, and appropriate. If I was OP, I would have found some comfort in them.

Thank you for being who you are, and being so transparent and available. I repeat, keep talking. Words have power, and you have a way with words. Merry Christmas.

And, yeah. Fuck 2019. Bring on 2020.",t3_efh4rm
