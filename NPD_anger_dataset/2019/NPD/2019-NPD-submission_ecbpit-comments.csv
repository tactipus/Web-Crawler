fbauhuc,t3_ecbpit,"It sounds like you're really hurting.  As someone who struggles with narcissistic tendencies I can related to all of these feelings and more.  Just because you haven't been given the tools to cope and therefore change does not mean you're a horrible person.  What it means is that someone hurt you and in your life so you actualize that pain either on yourself or other people.  But let me tell you something, if you're here, questioning why you do the things, if you're here expressing remorse, if you're here wishing  you could be a better person, then you can.  That's the beauty of the brain.  What things have you done to try and change these things about yourself?  The first step is exactly what you're doing here, acknowledging the problem. Have some compassion for yourself.",t3_ecbpit

fc02lxl,t3_ecbpit,"Not forgiven faggot.

Your ""i am sorry"" and your whole excuses mean shit, stop attention whoring and self pitying with the rest of the weak and fragile narcs. 

And no, all those traits aren't justified just cause you recognize them and you made an r-redit post.

If you have the slightest speck of dignity left in that shell you refer as a body, leave the people you torture alone. You pathetic waste.",t3_ecbpit
