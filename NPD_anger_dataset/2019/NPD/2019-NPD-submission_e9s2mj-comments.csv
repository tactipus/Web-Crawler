falthyr,t3_e9s2mj,"Here is a good neutral perspective for you to at least get you started in the a different direction.

Lack of empathy is a trait, just like eye color, height, etc. Traits arent inherently good or bad without a context. Tall on the basketball court? Superior. Tall when you're in 4th grade and all your friends make fun of you for being tall cause they're short? Inferior. Context is everything.

Yes, it is absolutely a disgustingly strong advantage to have, but the key follow up to that statement is: only in specific contexts. A lack of empathy can be a great advantage in the professional world for example. You want to go make bank on wall street by being a sociopath who doesnt give a fuck about the world? Do it!! Capitalism will thank you for your service and you will have all the money you could want to spend with people who abuse you as an ATM.

Narcissists are also really good at finding the contexts that suit them, so it's not surprising you might look at your life and see it as an advantage.

But a good place to start is to ask yourself what contexts do you think a lack of empathy might work against you? Where does a lack of empathy fuck you up? 

I used to feel the exact same way as you until life showed me the answer to the above.",t3_e9s2mj

faly63i,t1_fal7zer,"It never does to a Narc. Then your wife leaves you, your kids don't speak to you as soon as they aren't legally required to, and you lose every social connection you ever make once people figure out what you are and what you're doing.

The worst part about being a Narcissist is both that you think it isn't a problem, and that you think other people don't see you for what you are. It might take them awhile, sure. But the probability of being ""found out"" approaches 1. And that doesn't mean confrontation happens, it can also mean that people around you strategize on how best to manage your emotions for you, it can mean your wife is planning to take her maiden name back as soon as you're in the ground, it can mean that your children don't talk politics or anything of real substance for fear of whatever awful bullshit you're going to spew, etc.

Just because people aren't fighting with you doesn't mean you're clever, they've just realized there's no benefit to them in doing so.",t3_e9s2mj
