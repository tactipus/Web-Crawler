fbj0ioh,t3_ednrer,"Basically, you can tell you have a problem if it causes problems in your life. Usually following a theme.

Narcissism affects my life when I realize I jumped to a wrong conclusion and reacted poorly because of my false assumptions.

It's when I notice my hypocrisy, when I hate someone for doing something I have done or would do.

It's when I get irrationally angry.

Your parents bringing it out might not be because they are narcissists. It might be because they stress you out, have power over you, know a lot about you, challenge your greatness, worry about things you are confident about, etc.",t3_ednrer
fbjljoc,t3_ednrer,"Okay well I guess I’ll just explain most of my symptoms that I can pinpoint, since they’re what got me diagnosed in the first place lol. I get extremely angry when someone pokes at my ego or tries to challenge my authority in some way. Debate and competitive challenges are fine, but I tend to take them way too seriously. I’m always the smartest in the room, It’s almost impossible for me to imagine otherwise. I can’t empathize with others beyond a cognitive level, which makes it so I can’t make meaningful emotional connections. If I fail at something I always make an excuse for it and tell others I did better. I really don’t think others will understand me at all unless they either are me or are close to me in likeness, that’s why I come here because its easy to relate and there’s a lot of like minded individuals. Too many fantasies of the perfect relationship or the perfect life or celebrity status. They take up a good few hours of my day, but it’s not a huge issue because I like to fantasize and I often do it while multitasking. I’m not afraid to admit that I am VERY entitled. That’s probably one of my bigger problem symptoms, I expect so much of others but I never do anything for anyone else. It really strains my relationships, family in particular. Very arrogant, though I actually like how I am that way because it often comes off as somewhat normal confidence when I can get it under control. I used to fit 8 of the 9 criteria for NPD but now I fit only 6, which is still enough for the diagnosis but it’s improvement. Even if I do get to a point where it’s not considered NPD anymore it’s still gonna stick around because I don’t think it can really be “cured”. It can definitely be worked with for sure though, which is what I’m trying to do. Limit the negative symptoms and work with the neutral and positive ones to my advantage.

Edit: one more thing, I cannot apologize to save my life. My pride is excessive and even if I do recognize that I was acting objectively in the wrong I will not feel sorry. I’m more often sorry for myself when I actually am, but it’s pretty rare. I’m mostly a grandiose narcissist rather than a covert, but I do have some aspects of it in there.",t3_ednrer
fbj3sgc,t3_ednrer,"I haven't been professionally diagnosed but I've been told that I have some of the traits..... I was raised not displaying emotions. *Dont cry*, *why are you crying?* I don't like attention. I don't like special treatment. I could go on about what traits that I don't have, but the few that I have has crippled me deeply, especially in my relationship: A lack of empathy, or ability to understand and share the feelings of others, because I was never shown it, until recently due to my partner. It's a learning curve trying to learn empathy and also be empathic,  share my feelings, and be there for my partner. She's growing tired of me not being able to do anything and what I'm lacking. I feel guilty for letting people down for disappointing.",t3_ednrer
fbmk4t7,t3_ednrer,"I don't think it's useful to think about whether you ""are"" a ""narcissist"", but whether you think that your narcissistic patterns of behavior (which everyone has) are detrimental to your life. That is, shift your perspective from a question of diagnosis to a question of behavior and (corresponding) outcomes. The diagnosis perspective can become very ""woe is me"", whereas the outcomes-based perspective lets you stay grounded in problem-solving the issues that actually impact your life.",t3_ednrer
fblw6wq,t3_ednrer,"Two rapid fire thoughts spring to mind, how fckn upset and insistent I can get when people don't agree with my point in a conversation and how I literally had to give up competitive gaming because how much losing angered me and actually prevented improving.",t3_ednrer

hj6aux0,t3_ednrer,"I was raised by a NPD mother. She was my biggest bully and now I am mine. I have certain ""standards"" of how people should act. When they don't conform I find it extremely difficult to connect with them. A lot of my interactions are fake and forced. I do feel I am more intelligent than most people around me, therefore I do not associate with empathetic people. I've become aware of what I am, but I try to not let it wear off on my children. A lot of my interactions are forced, even with my children, but I don't want that life for them. I have a chance to change this pattern and I've made it my goal that it ends with me. No matter how hard it is I must try to set an example. I do ""good"" things to blend in, I say the right things to blend in, and I help to blend in. I am also married to a NPD, but we have the same goals. Past relationships I have lied and schemed to get my way. Used people as stepping stones and treating them as objects to be discarded. When I met my husband though he was aware of my game because it was his. It was weird to meet someone like myself. I hate failure and so does he. I've read a lot of NPD have toxic relationships (ours probably is in a sense) but if we lie, cheat, etc then we lose. I do not like to lose. Neither does he. We like to prove each other wrong. I noticed I felt this way when a family member died that didn't live up to my expectations. She was mean, spiteful, and a drunk. I didn't shed a tear or feel a thing when she died because in my eyes it's what she deserved. I feel this way about a lot of people. I knew it wasn't normal. My reactions were not normal and they had drawn attention. That's when I decided blending in was best.",t3_ednrer
fbj2whc,t1_fbj0ioh,"Can you be a bit concrete?

Jumping to conclusions based on wrong assumptions doesn't really say much. That can also be a way to describe hypervigilance for example. General X means Y assosiations. 

As for my parents, I did not share any info about them or their behavior, so you speak about something you know nothing about.",t3_ednrer
fbjq569,t1_fbjljoc,"Thank you,

Its quite beautiful to be able to learn how you view things. I really appreciate that.",t3_ednrer
fbjqdpm,t1_fbjljoc,"Would you mind telling me more about the concept of ""supply"" from your perspective?

Its more useful to learn from you, instead of a textbook abstraction from an outside viewer.",t3_ednrer
fbjm9xc,t1_fbj3sgc,"If you don’t like attention or special treatment you are definitely not a narcissist, that’s one of the obvious symptoms. Also none of those besides the lack of empathy are really symptoms at all. What It does sound a lot like though is ASPD, which most of the things you said seem to fit (besides feeling guilt). I would look into it and ask a professional about it, because these are very hard to diagnose and it might not even be a personality disorder. It could just be depression for all I know.",t3_ednrer
fbqc0mo,t1_fbmk4t7,Love this answer.,t3_ednrer
fbj3c8l,t1_fbj0z06,"Thank you for sharing.

May I ask, How does thinking others have ulterior motives differentiate from being suspicions? 

I'd it's not to much to ask, can you share abit more about being jealous when others receive attention and sympathy? 

Would you also recon that other people who suffer from NPD also experience this type of jealousy?",t3_ednrer
fblbony,t1_fbj2whc,"I said what parents ""might"" do. I never claimed to not be guessing, this is very general.

Jumping to conclusions is like if someone is tired when you talk to them so you assume they hate you. If someone forgets to give you something so you assume they withheld it on purpose.",t3_ednrer
fbjsm93,t1_fbjqdpm,"Of course, it’s a lot more useful to hear it directly from the source, I totally get it. For me, narcissistic supply used to have to come from other people constantly or I would fall into a depression. Over the last few months though I’ve come to realize that I can be my own supply. I was in CBT for years for issues other than NPD, so I finally started using the techniques I was given back then. A simple change in thinking knocked off a piece of criteria I used to qualify for. I’ve learned to build myself up rather than have others do it. It’s also helped a bit in reaction to criticism or judgment. Basically adopting an “I don’t care” attitude towards others, compliments are more than welcome and I still love them very much, but when those are absent I don’t have an issue with praising myself to get that “supply”. I went from almost complete covert to somewhat of a “healthy” grandiose narcissist. My inner struggles stemming from my narcissism are pretty much fixed, and I’m at peace with those internal conflicts. I don’t need external validation as much anymore because of that, so providing it myself is what I rely on nowadays. It’s a healthy way of coping so I’m proud that I can be self sufficient in that aspect now.",t3_ednrer
fbjt97r,t1_fbjm9xc,Probably so ....,t3_ednrer
fbjodnx,t1_fbj3c8l,"He’s lying, only a few weeks ago he was on this sub and many others begging for a diagnosis. Don’t believe a word. I have screenshots if you really wanna know for sure though.",t3_ednrer
fbl3i07,t1_fbjsm93,"Okey,

So what is supply?

What purpose does it serve?

ND why does people with NPD have a need for it?",t3_ednrer
fbjpz1l,t1_fbjodnx,"Anon23075, what are you doing?

Are you battling for attention or something?",t3_ednrer
fblj8bm,t1_fbl3i07,"Supply is the validation, respect, positive feedback, etc. we get from others that builds up our self esteem and makes us feel good about ourselves. We need it because whether we deny it or not most of us are deeply insecure or at least have a very impaired self esteem, so that supply is necessary to keep it stable.",t3_ednrer
fbjqyfz,t1_fbjpz1l,No I’m just tired of him taking up space in a forum he doesn’t belong in. He’s not diagnosed at all and he’s lied on several occasions about it. I have proof if you really want it. I’m tired of people believing him.,t3_ednrer
