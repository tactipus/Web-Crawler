fbv28az,t3_eektqm,"I have been selfish, entitled, sneaky, and manipulative as long as I can remember. I have always been a very analytical person, which allowed me to do things and get away with them, as well as say things to appeal to others regardless of whether they were true. I’d always assess the situation and act accordingly based on the information I gathered.

As for empathy, it’s somewhat tough to determine if I’ve ever experienced it. I was a very emotionally-sensitive child, but I still had issues understanding things from others’ point of view. more importantly, I didn’t care enough to make the effort. The most likely manifestation of “empathy” in me at that time is probably similar to how it is for me now: absent all the time unless the circumstances relate to me. For example, I may feel something that resembles a bit of empathy if I learn a friend has an eating disorder, as I have struggled with anorexia.

I was ironically a highly-anxious child. I am pretty calm and composed now but growing up, everything made me anxious. I had an anxious disposition that was further exacerbated by lots of bullying and social exclusion, primarily during middle school. I’d say that my NPD truly started to develop between 7th and 8th grade. All the things I had been teased for (my intelligence, vocabulary, knowledge, interest in school, etc.) suddenly became my assets and I took on a “me against the world” philosophy.

Around this time, I became obsessed with the idea of becoming someone great and proving everyone wrong. Having been told by my parents, teachers, and peers growing up how much potential I had and how intelligent I was, I began to see myself as somewhat of a genius. Everything in my life became about becoming even smarter. Then I realized how much looks mattered to society as well and I became obsessed with being the fittest, most beautiful person ever. That was the beginning of my anorexia.

Fast forward to now, and both those mentalities (becoming the smartest and becoming the prettiest) are still driving forces in my life.",t3_eektqm
fbuf2ws,t3_eektqm,"I had a smug face in school photographs (I was a future writer, documentalist and philosopher after all) and would be silent, disturbed and red in the face for at least a complete hour after being disrespected. And I would never forget about it.",t3_eektqm
fbujr3x,t3_eektqm,"I remember when I was about 12-13 I'd been trying to give everyone the impression that I was a genius with a wealth of knowledge and understanding beyond what I'd been taught.  I was almost inviting myself to get taken down.  I got caught out by a teacher once and it really bothered me.  I spent the summer holidays worrying that I'd get really shown up and embarrassed when school started again.  I kept trying to motivate myself to read encyclopedias to prepare myself for going back to school so I could prove that I really was that smart.  Looking back, I just find it so very sad.",t3_eektqm
fbv8oj9,t3_eektqm,"Pretending to have more knowledge than I did. Issues understanding other kids' emotions. Issues relating to people period. Feeling special. Sensitive to criticism.

I mostly remember myself as a somewhat loner who would rather read than talk to people. I was very curious and thought I was very disliked. I liked playing by myself and always felt robotic trying to interact with other people. 

I thought I was above others, above play, above breaking rules. I became an isolated elitist.

Edit: also, breaking rules varies. I was known to forge signatures, lie, play dumb, etc. But sneaking out of the house to see friends? Nah. I was weirdly a conformist rule breaker. I looked down on people who were exploring childhood and rebellion.",t3_eektqm
fbuvcw1,t3_eektqm,"Entitled, aggressive, and over confident. My narcissism has been here since birth pretty much, always been this way. Less aggressive now but I used to hurt people whenever they did something I didn’t like or I didn’t get my way. I got very mad easily, especially when kids would try to challenge me in any way. I was also extremely competitive and took things too seriously in competition. Seems like childhood narcissism that I just never grew out of and got worse over time.",t3_eektqm
fbwmf99,t3_eektqm,"I always needed to be the center of attention as a child. I remember having moods and being punished for them. I dissociated a lot so I don’t remember much of my childhood but I remember feeling sad and depressed, wishing I was someone else. I was pretty grandiose, often wanting to be the smartest most prettiest. I was also a bully. I struggled a lot with self-esteem much like I do today.",t3_eektqm
fc1usne,t3_eektqm,"superficial (quiet and aloof to others, loud and open to close ones), extreme emotional sensitivity or sensitivity to criticism, a sense of superiority and look down or pity those who were having any sort of issues (""sucks to be him/her, glad I'm not in that situation"") although this one was a lot more subtle compared to now, and going against the norms, etc. However I've made many efforts to go against exhibiting such bad traits.",t3_eektqm
fbxmatp,t3_eektqm,"I don’t remember much, other than having bad times, listening to music in my room and feeling alone. Had a big imagination that made me lie a lot, bully problems, and opposite sex problems.

A normal childhood I guess.",t3_eektqm
fcjunig,t3_eektqm,"I do not remember myself as a child. Literally amnesiac up to mid-high school.

Maybe some tiny flashes, everything else 0.

Was using some of the NPD superpowers already at that time, I remember that though.",t3_eektqm
fc1v8hw,t1_fbv28az,"very relatable here, especially the anxiety issues, now I seem to be a lot less anxious.",t3_eektqm
