I agree, people who come here to accuse pwNPD of all the shit they've been through have nothing to do here. Kudos to the mod team for keeping the place safe :)",t3_eh4sw0
fcf9z2g,t3_eh4sw0,"This is likely me thinking the world revolves around me haha but.... Ah, I post on some threads because I share an account with my partner who is struggling with his NPD and I felt as if getting some insight and supportive comments from an outside perspective might help.... Is this directed at me as well? I would never ever be mean or say something out of line (on purpose - I do sick my foot in my mouth sometimes but I don't think I have here). And if I have nothing to add that's constructive or supportive, I simply don't comment. 

I have seen dickheads post on here, and comments that are out of line and not at all constructive, but I hope you are referencing them and not people like me. ðŸ˜•",t3_eh4sw0
fcfdbo5,t1_fcf9z2g,Definitely them not you. It's a particular brand of person I'm thinking of,t3_eh4sw0
fcfhuu3,t1_fcfdbo5,"Oh thank goodness. And after I made this comment I saw the post you were referencing, and the comment(s). Yeah. I hope their ears were burning by the end of that.

 I've seen a lot of your posts and comments - you are very active on here - and it's all very enlightening and.....hope-sharing. If that makes sense. What you are trying to do - and doing - is something that I've witnessed to be completely draining and full of hopelessness at times as well. You've made a lot of progress, from what I can see. Keep it up. And feel free to message either of us at any time. We both appreciate your efforts, and you.",t3_eh4sw0
fcfjd6n,t1_fcfhuu3,Thanks. Reading this means a lot to me :) it's a long journey. Your comments are always appreciated.,t3_eh4sw0
