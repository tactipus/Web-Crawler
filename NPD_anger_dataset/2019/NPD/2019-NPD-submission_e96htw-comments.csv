fagr3t5,t3_e96htw,"This is the usual problem with NPD, its symptoms make you believe that you don't have it (or make you hide it, or make you refuse to admit it's an actual problem in your life) That's the essence of the condition. You're going to have deal with it directly, either that or live with this internal confusion for the rest of your life. Talk to your fucking psychiatrist.",t3_e96htw
fah5k5q,t3_e96htw,"good luck finding anything useful that’ll help you. everything you’ll find is likely to be about narcissistic abuse or how we’re all terrible evil people. i’d say go right to the DSM and think about the symptoms. also a good tip, narcissists *can* be aware that they are narcissists, but acceptance of the disorder is very rare (and i mean like damn near impossible). self acceptance is pretty similar to self awareness in the way of the concept, but one is definitely harder than the other. like i can totally see and recognize how i act and what makes up the disorder in me, but for me i don’t accept it as the main problem. i think it’s because my behavior gets misjudged and people overreact, which in turn causes my problems in relationship and social settings. for me it’s not the problem, i really do think it’s other people, because it doesn’t bother me all that much. it’s all external problems that are causing me to feel this way. if i’m depressed it’s because nobody’s validating me or taking the time to care or even talk to me. if i’m angry it’s because someone challenged me or a friend pointed out something they didn’t like that i do. if i’m anxious it’s because people are judging or actively criticizing me. it’s all external factors that make the internal feelings. i can say it’s actually all because of insecurity but i’m never gonna believe it, and i’ll always make excuses like those i just said.

also if you do have it the delusions should have been pretty heavy on you before you realized it. before i got diagnosed or even found out about the disorder i completely had the idea that i was always the smartest person in the room, always the most clever, always the funniest, etc. i still think this but every now and then i can break the delusion. i would describe it as your self esteem swaying back and forth but also aggressively fighting itself. like it’s two pendulums that sway the same direction but sometimes they end up at different speeds and hit each other in the middle. that’s the time when the delusion breaks. i don’t know how good of an analogy that is but that’s the best i got right now. at the moment i’m stuck in grandiose mode so i’m having trouble with perspective here, once that breaks though i tend to explain it better.",t3_e96htw

fahom6a,t1_fagskdn,I think it's probably more likely for a people who doesnt have it to believe that they do have it because they dont suffer from it.,t3_e96htw
