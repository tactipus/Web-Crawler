faic5an,t3_e9abxk,"Tbh you’re not going to like this, but them telling you you have a “unique case” of NPD just sounds like a tactic for you to admit it to yourself by appealing to your need to feel special. Similar thing happened to me",t3_e9abxk
fajab72,t3_e9abxk,Good luck to you. I can't even get therapy. I guess they feel I'm incurable or something like that.,t3_e9abxk

faksdnv,t1_faj2t1v,Yeah I’m sorry:( don’t get too down on yourself though. Reading through posts on this sub will definitely help you feel less alone,t3_e9abxk
fakca6a,t1_fajehz3,Psychiatrists don't want to give me therapy. I asked many times and they're always able to produce an excuse. Just 2 weeks ago I went to the ER to talk to a doctor and he said to me I can't get therapy because I have a drug problem. I think it's ridiculous because I smoke like 0.5 of weed day.,t3_e9abxk
fakskmi,t1_faksdnv,Yeah I've been going through this sub alot and I can relate to so much stuff here.,t3_e9abxk

faki805,t1_fakfja9,Well I'm getting substance abuse therapy now and I told my counsellor I was smoking a gram a day at first but yesterday I told her I was smoking 0.5 a day so it looks like I'm improving and making an effort.,t3_e9abxk
