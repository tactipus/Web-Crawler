fcjngkg,t3_ehijop,"Self love is most definitely what I struggle with most from narcissism. I definitely think it is the root cause for the majority of the other issues from the disorder.

Primarily, as you said in your post, we have no definite sense of self. Our being is almost entirely comprised of external relationships. What this does is prevent us from forming a stable internal ideal. Without that internal perception, it makes empathy very difficult. The reason being, we have no true morality that we hold ourselves by. We may have a concept of morality in its relation to the world around us. But when it comes to maintaining these codes, we have no *anchor* so to speak.

Our personality is often fairly empty beneath the masks we apply. This isn't to say we don't have a personality per se. But it lacks any attentiveness to our own long-term wellbeing in regards to morality/sense of self. Personally, I think they are tied together. The sense of love for ones self comes from an internal code of ideals that we hold ourselves to. And not the fake narcissistic love of the ego. But true, genuine love and empathy for ourselves. 

I believe the attachment of our being to external relationships comes from early childhood, often when a crucial relationship with a loved one becomes tainted or abusive (physically or emotionally). Because of this we develop an over reliance on external validation and an inability to form a meaningful sense of self. We begin to distance ourself from our internal monologue as we are taught that this self is ""wrong.""

The longer we exist in this pattern, the more deeply it holds. Past a certain point it probably becomes extremely difficult to form that sense of self in a meaningful way. I do think that if a narcissist can begin to find true love and compassion for their own condition, and often empathy for themselves and the reasons that brought them to this disorder (childhood trauma for example) then we can begin to unravel the causes from the roots.",t3_ehijop
fcjud97,t3_ehijop,"I see self love as an excuse for mediocrity.

They say: I can't afford nothing because I'm human trash not capable of doing anything productive to get money but I  love myself and I am good enough; ok, eat the love, buy a house with that love, heat yourself in winter with self love...

I see right through all that bullshit and know in an instant it is just an excuse to be an effin' waste of air doing nothing but taking up space.

What I achieve is the exact result of my actions which stem from my capabilities and worth. When I can not achieve anything, I am worthless by definition. That's not absence of self love, just common sense.",t3_ehijop
fck3t7c,t3_ehijop,"I think a lack of self love used to drive my behavior but I've gotten somewhere with it. I feel a lot less fragile now but it's a long fucking journey. There are definitely situations that I'll act like a fool in, but now I can identify it better and it also isn't EVERY SINGLE INTERACTION anymore.",t3_ehijop
fckcmxj,t3_ehijop,"Id like to add my own notion of self love and how I have heard a therapist describe it.

I beleive self love is a utilitarian principle. Self preservation is self love, as without the love of the self, we would not persist in our lives.

I do think it drives at the heart of PDs as well. A maladaptive self love born out of repeated traumas is how many PDs are understood.

Which is why I think it is philosophically and materialistically linked to the disorder.

I only offer this for those who might agree, as they feel it is instrinsic to their own progress or predicament. Im not saying anyone is right or wrong. ‚úå

I very much admire OP for cultivating his strengths.

I write this for those who feel their disorder has caused them pain through an inability to regulate emotions like anger and contempt, leading to isolation, ostracism or even suicidal ideation.

Self love in such circumstances is rather important I would say, as it is not the love of others that prevents the repeated behavior. It is the self preserving act of avoiding negative outcomes, not for others but for yourself.

When we protect ourselves from the mental and physiological decay of stress, that is an act of self love.

I hope this does not offend anyone. üôè

fcm0ijv,t3_ehijop,"This is exactly what I've been working on with my therapist, I told her that liking myself was 'recreational' and not the reason I go to therapy. Which she said made no sense. Haha. So I am trying to learn to like myself!",t3_ehijop
fcjxugh,t3_ehijop,"Self love has always been such an odd and cringy topic for me honestly. Like trust me I do *love* myself a lot, but not in the way everyone else does. I admire and idealize myself, I see myself as perfect and that I can do little to nothing wrong. This isn‚Äôt the self love people define though. ‚ÄúSelf love‚Äù to them is a way of accepting their inadequacy or failure to do something. I just see it as an excuse honestly. When I think of someone using the term I always think of something along the lines of ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre only human, we all make mistakes, accepting them is self love‚Äù. Why should we be accepting our mistakes and faults, shouldn‚Äôt we be working on them and improving as much as we can? They‚Äôre mistakes and faults for a reason. The concept of self love only exists to make mistakes seem okay, and I don‚Äôt find that to be something to work up to or respect.",t3_ehijop
fcmqghe,t1_fcjud97,"I completely get where you're coming from.  I've held this attitude for my entire life.

However, I've come to think in terms of learning and growth.  

For me, self-love is no longer about feeling ok with being mediocre and being an excuse for inactivity.  It's about being ok with NOT YET being as successful as I want to be and could be.  Self-love is what keeps me from flipping out when I'm not already good at something and giving myself the chance to learn.  Self-love is what ""lowers the stakes"" enough for me to face challenges with a clear head, knowing that I don't have to despise myself if things don't work out first time.

I used to think that self-hatred regarding my weaknesses motivated me to improve on them earlier in life.  However, if I look back honestly, I'm not convinced it ever worked.  I think my growth came from periods in my life where my self-hatred and narcissistic thinking were at their lowest.",t3_ehijop
fcjx4rk,t1_fcjud97,Couldn‚Äôt agree more honestly,t3_ehijop
fcwvkrv,t1_fcm0ijv,"My therapist gives me all these bullshit links and reports on ‚Äúself love‚Äù and ‚Äúaccepting myself,‚Äù but deep down I know despite how much I study, socialize, or work out, I‚Äôll still fucking hate myself",t3_ehijop
fcjzaw9,t1_fcjxugh,"Agreed. I think ""self love"" as it's defined these days is a recent thing and it's behind a whole lot of mediocrity at least in the western world. I honestly don't see why self love is even necessary. I'd rather not have any feelings towards myself at all and just focus on my actions and whether or not they are good actions. Self love doesnt need to factor in.",t3_ehijop
fckd1sj,t1_fcjxugh,"I think what people mean by self love is having a sense of self-worth that is stable independent of your accomplishments and achievements. Just like with any emotion, I don't think it is inherently good or bad, the question is only whether the role it plays in your life makes you happier or unhappier. Anger can be good thing when it compels you to change; it can be bad when you use it to destroy others.

Likewise, self-love can be bad if you use it as an excuse to wallow in pity, or to be satisfied with a stagnant and/or uninteresting life. On the other hand, I can imagine many scenarios where it confers a great advantage: for example, making you more satisfied with your own place in the world and removing the need to feel better than others or to bring them down.",t3_ehijop
fcmu75d,t1_fcmqghe,"Yup, self hatred for underperforming by our perfectionistic standards is default.

I had to fix both, hatred and perfectionism. They fuel each other.",t3_ehijop
fcwy1zj,t1_fcwvkrv,"Oh absolutely, if you are anything like me, then coming to like yourself is a long, long journey. I think trying to treat myself well is a good place to start but it's pretty fucking complicated and difficult to just 'like myself'. I know I'm not there yet. But I'm convinced at this point that it's something worth having.",t3_ehijop
fcxtn1m,t1_fcwy1zj,"I mean, I don‚Äôt treat myself poorly, but at the end of the day I‚Äôm still dissatisfied. Even after all the physical, mental, or intellectual work I put in to try and improve myself.",t3_ehijop
fcyvp8r,t1_fcxtn1m,"Oh yeah. Well to explain what has helped me - I've been doing 'EMDR' therapy to reprocess the emotional/painful experiences which led to the development of my narcisism (and other schema, eg 'I'm a bad person', 'I am unworthy').

In my case this includes bullying, childhood shaming and invalidation. So I'm not just treating myself better, we are trying to directly effect my subconcious emotional... process. The experiences which led to me having a negative relationship with myself.",t3_ehijop

fdmsdu5,t1_fdm0vxg,"The EMDR I would say.... maybe 6 EMDR sessions so far??  I have been seeing the current therapist through all of 2019, maybe for 15 or so sessions. In total I must have had 40 therapy sessions over the past 3 years.",t3_ehijop
