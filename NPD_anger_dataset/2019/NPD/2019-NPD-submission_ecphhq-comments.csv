fbcyaom,t3_ecphhq,"Thank you for your post. It really spoke to me. I have to grieve the loss of my narcissism, which is who I am and become a new normal whole person.",t3_ecphhq
fbdbb4k,t3_ecphhq,"Yeah I’ve said this in the past that it’s like grieving over yourself, and that’s why I’m not really trying to “recover” so to say. Narcissism is who I am, it’s deeply ingrained and it *is* my personality. I find it can be quite an advantage even. The thing about NPD that makes me want to remain self aware and nothing more is that some symptoms just can’t be fixed. The whole problem will never actually be solved. Another reason is I just don’t see it as a problem for me. I can recognize that my behaviors are causing my external problems in relationships and everyday life but I don’t think the solution is to cater to everyone else while making yourself feel miserable. Like why should I have to give up my entire self just so others can tolerate me a little better? And if a lot of people actually *like* me for who I am then why change for the few that don’t? It just doesn’t make sense to me. I should be living for myself, not others. I really do think that as narcissists we should be striving to coexist with our narcissism, not eliminate it. There are ways we can eliminate the negative effects of it on ourselves, we have practices that can allow ourselves to face criticism and judgment easier. We have ways that can slow the rate at how much our self esteem swings back and forth. And probably most important, we can practice self control. We don’t actually have to be these argumentative, abusive people that some of us are. Being able to control our narcissism is what we need to do, because I really do think eliminating it just causes more problems than anything.",t3_ecphhq
fbczckx,t3_ecphhq,"I understand where you’re coming from and it’s a core part of recovery (I assume, anyway; clearly I’ve got a lot of work to do still). What intimidates me is that my narcissism isn’t just a *big* part of my life, it is the *biggest* part of my life and my character. My interests, hobbies, and career path were all shaped by my narcissism to some considerable extent. When I let go, I don’t know what else to do. That’s the hard part, I think.",t3_ecphhq
fbd1rox,t3_ecphhq,"I've said the same thing without realizing what it meant. That we must let our old selves die for our new ones to be born. And I see now that you're right, it's a grieving process. 

We grieve for the relationships our narcissism built; we grieve for the systems of coping we forged around our narcissism; we will, inevitably, never be the same again. Thats incredibly scary to think. 

But to truly change we must allow ourselves to grieve. Without it, we will never move on.",t3_ecphhq
fbgm0as,t1_fbdbb4k,"Well, except that narcissism is inherently dysfunctional and its perks are in most cases offset by the disadvantages. I'd rather try to obtain a healthy self esteem and sense of self than just get comfortable with what I know was likely created by childhood abuse and later on caused immense damage not only to others but myself. I agree with you that I will never completely go away though and that it has perks.",t3_ecphhq
fbdbk0j,t1_fbczckx,"You don’t have to let it go completely though, there is such a thing as healthy narcissism. Learning to coexist with your narcissism and having self control is the key to a balanced life with this disorder. Why get rid of the thing that has caused you the most success in life for the sake of a few people who can’t handle us? It just doesn’t make sense. We shouldn’t have to live for other people like this, we shouldn’t have to sacrifice everything just to be tolerated. We can control our narcissism with practice, and that’s where you’ll be most happy in life.",t3_ecphhq
fbgnvnh,t1_fbgm0as,"It really depends on the type of narcissist you are. Coverts are gonna have a lot more internal problems than external, so I can get it if that’s what you are, but I’m the grandiose type so I don’t necessarily have that masked insecurity. My self esteem is just inflated and easily hurt in my case. What I can do for myself is learn to have thicker skin when it comes to criticism, and practice self control when it comes to being aggressive with others so I can prevent problems in relationships. Mine didn’t manifest from abuse either, I’ve just kind of been this way all my life. What I was talking about was a very general solution for people like me, because that’s what I do to cope with the external problems caused by my narcissism. I wrote it with people like me in mind, grandiose narcissists, not coverts, so please don’t derail just because it doesn’t pertain to you.

Tl;dr what I wrote only works for narcissists who have external problems because of their narcissism, internal conflict stemming from it cannot be helped by what I advised in my first comment",t3_ecphhq
fbgorbw,t1_fbgnvnh,"Hey, gotcha, but it wasn't derailing, I just swept it to my terrain like a good narcissist. Don't narc-shame me now, you are the one defending coming to terms with how we are! Lol I am definitely more the covert type, but grandiose fantasies are recurrent.",t3_ecphhq
fbgpy9i,t1_fbgorbw,"Well it was more meant to be a positive thing to learn from, not really something to question or criticize like you were doing. But yeah covert types aren’t gonna benefit much from what I put out when it comes to advice.",t3_ecphhq
fbgqv38,t1_fbgpy9i,"No harsh feelings, apparently I tried to devaluate you but you defended the position well. I saw you editing the comment at least twice too, I tend to do that as well, haha. Hopefully I learn via CBT/habit forming to not come across so questioning or devaluating, it creates a lot of conflict and often I am not even trying to attack anyone. This sub seems very useful for self-improvement!",t3_ecphhq
fbh5uuv,t1_fbgqv38,"No problem there, recognizing it is definitely improvement. Also I like to edit my comments to add clarity or to add points that I thought would make for a better reply. And don’t worry, you will. It may take some time but if you stick to it you’ll be fine. This place is great in terms of productivity, so I would hope it helps.",t3_ecphhq
