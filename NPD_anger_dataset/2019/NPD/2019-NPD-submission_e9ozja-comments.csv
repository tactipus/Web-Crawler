emotional reactivity could just be a teenager thing. 

Regardless, it's possible that you might have some narcissistic traits. If you're truly concerned about the extent to which this impacts your life, see a psychologist.",t3_e9ozja
famdywl,t3_e9ozja,"nobody here can diagnose you, but for insight i think you have a few traits. it seems like you don’t have the full on disorder though, cause this comes off as mild symptoms. it depends on how much it bothers you and how much it bothers the people around you though. go to a psychologist to find out though.",t3_e9ozja

famgi0o,t1_famedhr,"i think delusions are a big one. personally i always feel like the smartest person in the room, and i probably always will think that. in reality it’s a delusion but for me i don’t see it that way, i can call it that but it won’t be that in my eyes. it doesn’t matter if someone else is objectively right, i’ll find a way to make them look wrong or a way to justify my standpoint so that i am right, because that’s what my intellect depends on. for strong symptoms i think you really have to be able to look at a delusion, and then still find a way to say that it’s not a delusion. like you can recognize it for what it is but you won’t accept it. that’s what i think is a very strong indicator. the fantasies i say are on the weaker end of things because i’m sure tons of people who aren’t narcs think of perfect futures and careers, i don’t think that’s special to us. narcissistic choices aren’t the strongest symptom either, in reality humans are just self preserving by nature, so i think unconscious choices to get ahead are pretty normal. where i think it differentiates from a weak to a strong symptom though is how you go about that choice. if you consider “hey this might hurt someone” and you decide against it, you don’t do it because you can feel empathy for the person who might get hurt. but for it to be a narcissistic symptom, you won’t even think or consider that possibility. you don’t really have to need to think about how it affects anyone else, only how it affects you. so really the difference is “this might hurt someone so i won’t do it” vs “this will get me ahead so i’ll do it” when making narcissistic choices. the lack of empathy is shown there. i hope this makes sense bc i’m a little disoriented from lack of sleep rn, if you need clarification i can try to make it clearer.",t3_e9ozja

famk880,t1_famhsi3,"i think that might be empathy? again i lack it completely so i have no clue at all, but i’d say if you can imagine what they would feel in that situation and feel it yourself, then that would count. again i have no idea so i could be wrong there actually. that’s like the one thing i can be okay with not being the most competent about, if i don’t know it then i just don’t know it. i can relate to the value part for sure, i don’t care if someone did the same thing because the fact that i did it is what makes it special and more valuable. i also think i could do anything in any field, i mean if you’re working alongside people in that field and you have the opportunity to learn while you do it, i don’t see how it could be difficult. the only thing i think that throws off the delusion is that you can cognitively accept it as such. like for me if i’m in a room with a bunch of math majors and i’m the only science major, i can understand that they’re better at math than i am, but as a whole i’m better than them because i’m great at a variety of things other than that. it’s also not so much about skill and how much you know for me, personally its about IQ and intellect level. i always feel like mine is the highest, and i actually do have a very high IQ at 174, so i don’t have any reason to believe otherwise. i may not be the smartest when it comes to math in that group of people, but i am the overall most intelligent if that makes sense. this is something i can’t deny or say is a true delusion, because i cognitively acknowledge it as the truth and not something that’s false. the thing is though, you can, so it’s less of a strong symptom in terms of severity of the delusion.",t3_e9ozja
