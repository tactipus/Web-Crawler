faeto1o,t3_e8v4q4,"As a covert narc, I often feel like I have to battle different personalities inside of me to understand why I have chosen to take a particular action. Is it actually because I want to be nice to this person? Or am I just doing this to get attention and make people feel bad for me? This is not a battle, it is a war with many fronts, which wages on day after day. And it is always so so easy to give in to the narcissistic voice and convince myself I'm it selflessly.

With that in mind, I would ask you this:

Why are you writing this post? Why did you decide to post on /r/NPD on this particular day, out of all the things you could be doing? If you're like me, there won't be one answer to this question. Perhaps you feel sorry for yourself. Perhaps you want attention. It's okay to admit that these are part of the reason why. 

What's more important, I think, is to realize that you came here because some small part of you acknowledges that you have a problem and that you want to be better. It's not the dominant voice, by far –– that's why you're on this subreddit, and that's why your post reads the way it does. But it's there. 

Then again, this is all me projecting onto your post.",t3_e8v4q4
fajq1zy,t3_e8v4q4,"I recently awakened to my own covert narcissism when all of my normal coping mechanisms failed me, which it sounds like you might be heading towards. There is a massive depressive episode that occurs when these methods fail you, and it's absolutely brutal. You might feel like theres no reason to live, life will never be ideal, etc...that's how I felt. 

It's pretty critical you have an actual liscensed clinical psychotherapist for this. Your current counselor situation sounds inadequate. Even if you go to therapy to find you're not a covert, it will have been worth it. Expect about 6 weeks of therapy at least. Please go talk to a mental health professional! I promise it's worth it.",t3_e8v4q4
