fcgfw2b,t3_eh6tc8,"This is always tricky I think for a lot of people and therapists. A diagnosis is essentially a compilation of symptoms. The more of one group of symptoms you have, the more you “fit” into a particular diagnosis. I think some therapists feel if you treat the symptoms a person has, the diagnosis is more irrelevant. Have you studied the DSM? Do you know for sure you have NPD? Even so, part of you needing/wanting the label may also be a sx of NPD and your therapist may be trying to use this as a way to treat you. Are you able to switch your focus? Is it too uncomfortable for you to engage in therapy when your therapist doesn’t do or say exactly what you want? And now, let’s consider you get your therapist to diagnosis you with NPD? Now what? There’s no secret treatment that exists specifically for NPD. It’s all about how to treat your symptoms to mitigate as much harm as possible in your life (and others). It’s really the difference between saying someone IS Bipolar v. someone HAS Bipolar disorder. There’s a slight difference but really it’s all the damn same. There’s so many varying degrees that exist within personality disorders. The main focus should always be treating symptoms.",t3_eh6tc8
fcfre5a,t3_eh6tc8,"Diagnosis is mostly used by insurance for billing. Therapists will treat your symptoms and that will be the most helpful. Maybe knowing the diagnosis could help some people but devouring information about personality disorders made me crazier. I understood why I was the way I was but I still couldn't stop or help myself. That self awareness was very painful and led to very difficult years. Now I tell my therapist what I'm currently dealing with and we address thought distortions, challenge thoughts, practice distress tolerance etc. and therapy is much more effective for me that way.",t3_eh6tc8
fcg7xh0,t3_eh6tc8,"maybe i'm misunderstanding what you mean by ""in writing"" but it sounds like your therapist kind of sucks. the diagnosis applies at this point, but you can't have it until you quantify its value?

i'd say that having a diagnosis is important to you because it means you have a therapist who does her damn job.

**Edit:** perhaps she should have to explain why receiving payment for her services is important to her.

sorry i'm so fired up but i can only compare this to my own diagnosis of Tourette's Syndrome in the third grade. it was huge for me to finally be able to explain why i'm doing these weird things. if that were withheld from me i'd have been miserable. like, the only label that would apply at that point is ""crazy"".",t3_eh6tc8
fcgwyde,t1_fcgfw2b,"Thanks for your super long reply. Lemme tackle it: yes, I've studied the DSM a lot and am quite sure I have NPD, and multiple folks have corroborated this. I am as certain I have NPD as I can be by analyzing myself which I realize is super flawed.

Also I considered my quest to Find Out if I'm right may be symptomatic and brought it up to my therapist lol. I do get uncomfortable when she responds unpredictably and doesn't ""take the bait"" which made me realize how much I try to control convos. 

Agree on treating symptoms but for some reason I'm just so damn flustered I fit everything but don't have it on paper. I have no idea why. Could be a need for control. For some reason, having an official dx would be relieving. Maybe because so many have called me a narc and I certainly have the traits.

As a note, there has been an issue with official testing being accepted as my therapist suspects I could be manipulating them (which I think is very telling).",t3_eh6tc8
fcgxyhq,t1_fcfre5a,Thanks for your input! I appreciate it. I'll think this over.,t3_eh6tc8
fcgxqvj,t1_fcg7xh0,"Yeah, when explaining myself I invariably provide the scores for my traits and it ends up being a fucking dissertation and I feel crazy. For me it's almost like being gaslit.",t3_eh6tc8
