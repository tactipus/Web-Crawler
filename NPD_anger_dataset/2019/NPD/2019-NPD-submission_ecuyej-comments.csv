fbg691g,t3_ecuyej,"She told me once, after a bad episode, ""when you feel yourself getting mad, don't"" 

I scoffed at it at the time, so easy to do, right?  So easy to say ""just don't get mad"" when that anger just comes boiling up so FAST and so huge...but

She's right.  

I'm not always wrong when I'm angry, but I AM always angry when I'm wrong...so having to learn to recognize and mistrust my own anger is the biggest thing.  I get what you're saying, how the hell do I stop and think when I'm in the midst of an episode of pure anger and defensiveness?

There's no easy answer, it's something that I struggle with daily.  One thing that I have tried very hard to do is take a particular picture, one that is personally tied up in a lot of shame for me, and try to teach myself to pull that picture up in my head every time I get angry.  

For me, it is a picture of my partner at an airport, unsure of whether or not I am picking her up.  

Silly, I think, OF COURSE I am coming to pick her up...but my reactions have caused her to question that...and it makes me ashamed.  It makes me keep the true evidence of the havok I've wreaked right there in my face.  

I will not learn to take responsibility for my actions unless I am confronted with the damage I've done.

Hold yourself over the fire, OP.  You have to build the muscle up before you can ever hope that it will react on its own.

fbfbeqt,t3_ecuyej,"OP, I know where you are.  I've been in a relationship for going on three years now with someone who has had to deal with my NPD, someone who refuses to give up on me.  

It's a hard state to be in, being unable to trust yourself, trust the way that you react to things.  I am nowhere near good enough, may never be...but I am trying.  You have to keep trying to.  I find the analogy that makes the most sense to me is alcoholism.  You can't let up.  You can't rest on your laurels when you get some things right.  You can't take your finger off the switch, as it were, because people like you and I cannot depend on ourselves to simply react the correct way to things that threaten that narcissism.  When I am not vigilant is when I explode with temper, it's when I start trying to convince myself that I am better off alone...it's when I hurt my partner the most.  She calls it ""NPDing Out"" and it's very apt.  When that narcissism is threatened I ""NPD out"", seemingly like Bruce Banner and the Incredible Hulk...not realizing until it's too late how much damage I am doing to her, to myself, to our relationship.

You don't give up.  Your partner will have to be your yardstick...don't hesitate to ask ""Hey...how am I doing?"" and the moments when seemingly out of the blue your partner let's you know that they've noticed a difference in you...celebrate those moments.  Build the habit.  The empathy and consideration is a muscle that people like us don't know how to use, so it takes constant exercise to build it up.  When the muscle works immediately, when you handle a situation with a cool, level head instead of feeling threatened and immediately going on the offensive with someone you truly love and do not want to hurt...celebrate those moments too.

I still have bad times.  My control is nowhere near where it needs to be, and it will be tough for you as well...but remember to apologize.  Remember to talk.  Remember that it's okay to stop EVERYTHING and THINK.  It's something that I'm still struggling with, too.  It's something I've never had to do, because I've always been so happy with just destroying my relationships in favor of myself.  The lies, the temper, the overreacting, the guilt...it's all part of that.

You aren't alone.  You aren't the only one wishing they could just flip a switch and be normal...be loving and empathetic... I'm here if you want to talk about it (would love to, in fact) and my partner is here, too.  Don't give up.  

I have manipulated, cheated, put myself above all else...and worst of all, my partner, whom I love, cannot truly trust me and may not be able to for...ever, maybe.  Those horrible moments when you sort of come to your senses and see the devastation you've wrought...they are the absolute lowest moments of my life.  I have wasted so much time, so many chances.  But I am still trying.  I am still hopeful.

When that muscle works, you'll thank yourself and your partner will thank you, too...it will make them feel safe, it will make them feel loved...the things you, not your disorder, want them to feel.  I wish you the best of luck, OP.  

Here if you need me,

fbh0ayp,t3_ecuyej,"There is a youtube video by doctor grande about changing narccistic behaviors by yourself.

I have schizoid pd and apperantly narccistic tendencies (that i didnt know about), i found the methods he described to eventually kill me, if i didnt hurt others i ended up hurting myself, for exemple he recommended during a discussion to think thinga through and only then react, i tried this method partly and i ended up not geting anything from interactions, it all felt like meaningless words.

From what i read cbt therapy is the fastest change you can get, the non-therapy methods end up costing in other ways from my own expirience, if you are too afraid to hurt people you end up isolated, if you dont act on your impulses you end up feeling like a calculated robots and life loses meaning because you never do what you want to do, which is be impulsive (for me), those are the things i tried and i ended up isolated again, you can try maybe for you it will be different, you have a partner, you can leverage that for your benefit, make her or him be involved in changing, if thats what you want, i was all by myself in this but you have a chance",t3_ecuyej
fbg6q8o,t1_fbg691g,"Forcing yourself to think of something bad? A moment where you are completely ashamed of yourself?
I will try that. I will try to recall those specific images. I have a few moments in which I was completely and utterly ashamed of myself. Either because of my inability to just do the things I needed to do or due to my inability to cope and deal with the mess I did.
Looking back and trying to recall all those moments is really hard. My mind actively tries to prevent me from doing that, and it just feels like my mind is clouded and not at 100%.
But talking to you, a fellow, is helping. I know it can be beaten. I know I can beat myself. And rise anew.
Thank you, Kenneth.",t3_ecuyej
fbg18xu,t1_fbfbeqt,"Thank you for your words, Kenneth.
All this is just so hard. I am trying to force myself to write down when I am behaving differently. I try to document what the trigger was, what happened, what the underlying problem is and what I would have liked to do/say instead.

What really destroys me is that I realised all this way too late. I have abused my partner for years. Without ever realising that.
And now that I know what I am doing, it's hard to stop. It's as you said with the hulk. I feel like I am on control when I ""NPDout"", as you put it, but looking back I think to myself that I don't know why I did this. My mind just feels as if it is veiled all the time.
But if it were just about me, I wouldn't care that much. But I see what damage I did to my partner and still do. And it breaks me. And it breaks me even more that all my feelings for them are not strong enough to overwrite my bad behaviors.",t3_ecuyej
fbic3qp,t1_fbg6q8o,"I'm glad, OP.  I'm so glad that I could be of some help to you.  Stay in touch with me, I could use the support every bit as much as you.  

Our partners are worth putting the work in.  They're worth holding ourselves in the fire for.  I just finished writing in a journal that I'll give to her when more has been written in it.  It includes my own fears, my own insecurities, my own worries about my ability to change.  Everything.  Triggers, reactions, idle thoughts, lies I think about making.

Write them down, and share them with your partner.  Let them see that you are not ignoring the problem.

And good luck, above all

Kenneth",t3_ecuyej
fbg3956,t1_fbg18xu,"OP, writing it down is a great place to start.  I'm lucky enough to have a partner who sees through the disorder to the real me...but I've done so much damage over the years that like you, it's hard to comprehend why she is still here. It's hard to look back on things and try and puzzle out ""what the fuck was I thinking?' because the truth is, I was thinking about myself and forgetting or CHOOSING to forget that she is important to me, that my relationship with her is important to me, that HER happiness is important to me.

Over the past year I've had to learn some hard things about myself, but one of the most difficult things to see is just how selfish I really am.  Maybe selfish is the wrong word, but it's the most closely apt.  I have spent my life thinking of myself first and foremost and only.  Something too hard, too difficult?  Give it up.  Something inconveniences me?  Too much trouble.  Someone dares point out when I've hurt then by thinking of myself only?  Hell no, get out.  

These are embarrassing things to realize, and they fill you with guilt and shame and that in turn can be its own NPD trigger...it definitely is for me.  I absolutely hate when my own flaws and detrimental actions are pointed out, and it brings that narcissism straight to the front, makes me defensive, makes me WANT to fight...because the truth is it is difficult to change and difficult to deal with the responsibility of my actions, and therefore it is an inconvenience to me and my narcissism demands that I remove that inconvenience from my life, even it that means I end up alone and especially if it means hurting someone that I care very deeply about.  

It's a loud voice, and I've spent my life listening to it.  I'm only just now questioning it, wondering if maybe that voice is wrong...and that's a tough thing to wonder.

The thing that is perhaps most difficult for me, and something that I am learning is perhaps the very MOST important thing...

These things I have done to hurt my partner and my family...they cannot be just forgiven.  I've been forgiven and things have been allowed to slide and I've been given more chances and I just go into the same patterns again.  No forgiveness, no promises.  These things HAVE TO BE TALKED ABOUT.  I say that with authority because I know for a fact that being forgiven does me no good at all.  I have to face the things I've done.  I have to be confronted with the lies I've told.  People like you and I have to see the damage that we've done.  Putting it away doesn't help, and I know that the only thing that will lessen that trigger that comes with the guilt and responsibility for my actions is bathing in it.  Put yourself in the fire and remember that the voice in your head is not based on fact, but one that is colored by a disorder, and not to be trusted until you learn to decipher what's real and what's just your narcissism talking.

Talk.  It is the only thing that will truly show your partner that you are willing to face your mistakes...it is the only thing that will make them hopeful that those mistakes may not be repeated in the future.

It feels so unfair, so laborious, so damn INCONVENIENT...and that's exactly what we need.  

Here for you, OP

Kenneth",t3_ecuyej
fbg47ra,t1_fbg3956,"Again, thank you for taking your time to talk to me.
The thing about writing this down is that I don't always remember or /want/ to write it down. These past few months, my partner and me went through several versions of To-Do Lists, arrangements and coping mechanisms, but each and every one of them I broke. I didn't do anything, try to put it off as ""But look at what I already did!"" But never accomplished anything.
I rest on that thought, that I already did something. That I already made progress. But each and every time, it gets pointed out that I really didn't. I can't tell you how many times my partner and me had this conversation. How many times I tried to argue on practically no ground whatsoever. And yet still they stay by me.
I try to appreciate what they give to me. All those chances, because we want it to function. We want to stay together, but I need to get my shit together.

Do you have any day-to-day tips, Kenneth?",t3_ecuyej
fbg4ta4,t1_fbg47ra,"Hahaha your response actually made me laugh out loud, OP.      I've had the EXACT same conversations with my partner, only my version of ""But look at what I already did"" is ""CAN'T YOU SEE ME TRYING????""

I know exactly where you are, and above all I know that hopeless feeling that comes with something not working.  All too well.  I'm going to share something with you that I originally told my partner as a lie, but one that I think more and more is a viable coping mechanism for day to day interactions.

Let the Fat Cat Run, it stands for Listen to your partner, Feel your initial reaction, Consider whether that reaction is something YOU want, or your narcissistic personality just TELLS you you want....and finally, React with knowledge instead of emotion.  L.F.C.R.

Stupid, I know.  But when I actually DO those steps instead of just hoping to get credit for THINKING about them...it works.  You have to put something in between your narcissism and your reactions to other people.  You have to put a speed bump in between your brain and your mouth, something that will hopefully slow your initial reaction down enough for you to consider whether or not it is really how you feel.

And talk.  Talk, endlessly.  Talk when the absolute last thing you want to to do is talk.  Talk even when it's making you feel angry and put upon because something I've learned about myself is this: if I'm getting defensive, it most likely (almost ALWAYS) means I'm reacting the wrong way.

It's hard.  So fucking hard.  You have to be so vigilant, and you will want to give up so many times...you have to constantly remind yourself (not yourself so much as that traitorous voice in your head) just how important your partner is to you.

Find the triggers, and talk them to death.  

Here for you, OP

Kenneth",t3_ecuyej
fbg5as2,t1_fbg4ta4,"Trying to put a speed bump between brain and mouth. It sounds like it can work, but really only if in those moments I can recognize that I am at fault. I think, that's the hardest part for me. If I see my behavior after its done, its already done.
And trying to question your own thoughts, memories and stand when you are in that state seems nigh impossible for me.
But therein lies that problem. I need to be able to flip the switch, when I don't realize I need to do it.
Do you have a daily ritual? Does meditating work? 
If so, what kind of meditation?
Really, again, thank you for taking your time, Kenneth.",t3_ecuyej
