fbrxodm,t3_ee3rnr,"I find, for myself, I have experienced verrrrry similar things. Coming down to control, ofc. 

Anyway, the feeling I trust now is calmness. With calmness comes clarity. I'm not telling others how to be, but it seems like whenever I have really powerful emotions, I end up fucking myself over. My major focus has been stability. 

That being said, it's hard to not get excited when I sense improvement. The issue w narcs is we can change yeah - it's the stability of the change that counts. So equilibrium and being content in steadiness is my goal. I trust the confidence but I don't rely on it.",t3_ee3rnr
fbqbh2f,t3_ee3rnr,"I’m in a similar situation as my partner and i “broke up” for the millionth time after I acted out and did some dumb shit out of rage (really fear). I’m so devastated that he had the courage to finally break up with me knowing I treated him like shit. For the last week I’ve felt depressed and of course am back on my kick wanting to “change”. At first, like you, I was confident I could show him how much I love him and he’d take me back but really I’m scared to death I actually have to show up and be different this time. He knows all my tricks. He’s totally on to me so if I come with some bullshit, I know he’ll be gone. He’s in protective mode. So the difference is having to show a little bit of vulnerability. Not knowing if what I do or the changes I make will actually make him want to stay. Taking the mask off so that I’m not love bombing him or trying to manipulate the situation but really taking a step back and working on myself. I realized I’m not confident at all. In fact I’m just the opposite. But instead of trying to hide that. I think I’m gonna sit with it awhile. See what happens.",t3_ee3rnr
fbsd7gk,t1_fbqbh2f,"Really hits home, what you said about your partner being in ""protective mode."" It sucks to know that your partner is wary of you, makes me feel guilty and angry at myself, makes me feel stupid and childish.

Sigh

Going to take a long time to get things back to totally good.  Can't give up.",t3_ee3rnr
fbspgo7,t1_fbsd7gk,"Thanks for responding, honestly it really helps to have a community of people who know exactly how you feel. I wish we could all get together in person and have a support group. I hope that things work out for you. What have you tried? Therapy? Don’t give up. All is not lost.",t3_ee3rnr
fbz5we1,t1_fbspgo7,"Currently trying therapy, which has been helping.  Took some time off from it until after the holidays but I'll be getting back on the horse after the New Year.  The thing that seems to help the most is talking to others, on both sides of the issue.  I wish you the happiest of holidays, friend, and the best of luck",t3_ee3rnr
