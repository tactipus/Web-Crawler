I was super paranoid and I believed people talked about me and thought about me all the time, and that everyone secretly hated me. Well... eventually they were just totally done with me, thanks to me being batshit.",t3_e8l8os
faffagy,t3_e8l8os,"I get that way, that's why I like to hang out with people 1-on-1 and not let my friends know each other. Keep them separate and they can't talk by themselves. Having ""groups"" of friends disturbed me. I get this way even more strongly at work and my coworkers and boss really do shit-talk people behind everyone's back",t3_e8l8os
fad4ws9,t3_e8l8os,"this sounds a lot like paranoid PD honestly. the feeling that people are always out to get you, talking behind your back, spreading rumors and lies. i wouldn’t say this is part of NPD. it could just be an anxiety thing too though, but it sounds more on the delusional end of things so i’m leaning towards the paranoid PD. not a psych tho so don’t take it as a diagnosis, but i would look into it.",t3_e8l8os
