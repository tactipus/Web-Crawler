fbh2bxr,t3_ed7u74,"If you meant giving advice to me, I think you helped. And having shut down like that does not invalidate the advice you give.
But I can only tell you what I need to accept myself: It's a shitty thing to do, whatever you did. If you just thought about it clearly for a bit, you would have prevented it. But that fact is the most important. You know how to prevent it.
Try to write that down. Try to put into written words what went wrong, what the underlying problem is, what the trigger was and what you would have liked to do instead, had you thought about it.
Maybe show it to your love, keep a notebook of it. Try to write it by hand, not into your phone or computer. Make it as personal as possible, so you know it was ""you"" who wrote that. That it was you who thought that you'd want to behave differently. Maybe record yourself voice messages. Directives you give yourself.
I don't know what you did. But you have to accept that it happened. There's nothing you can do about it now. Take that loss, don't forget it and try to make it your last mistake. There is nothing else to do anyways!",t3_ed7u74
fbgau1z,t3_ed7u74,"Can you tell me what you did? I have the same issue with my tendancy to try to shut down my emotions, my vulnerability. It sucks man.",t3_ed7u74
fbjfdns,t3_ed7u74,"Not sure what you said, but the fact that you even realize you fucked up shows you're further along than most people here. Does your partner know about your NPD/tendencies? If not, maybe it's time for that discussion. At the very least you should communicate what you posted here.

For controlling outbursts, all I know to say (as someone who struggles with them myself) is that it's a muscle. If I'm not cautious and I give up on monitoring myself for a couple days, I'll slip back into anger being the norm. It sucks and I'm hoping to move past it entirely one day.",t3_ed7u74
fbw9yij,t3_ed7u74,"No, no one is better at giving advice on our issues than someone whoâ€™s lived through our issues: another narc. 

People cannot understand what itâ€™s like to suffer deeply. I honestly hate normal people so much. 

In regards to your relationship, you should hold onto it dearly. Not a lot of people would truly love a narcissist. And if you find someone who does, it is everything. Although I understand it is hard for us to care.",t3_ed7u74
fbyr1j1,t3_ed7u74,"I'm new to this place, and don't - I think - have NPD.. so please forgive any social blunders.

But my partner does, and, especially at this time of year, it's tough going at times. Hence I'm sat on my sofa reading your thoughts whilst he has his normal Christmas meltdown. Whykennethwhy - your week sounds like mine, but from the other side of the coin. 

I just wanted to thank you all for your incredibly insightful posts, really, and not sure where else to post it.

It helps a lot, to read about life from your point of view.  It's a painful read at times as it reinforces things I knew but didn't know how to articulate

He is ball of misery on self destruct mode masquerading as ok on a good day. Even telling him I'm there for him gets spat back at me then. 

Through posts like yours I'm learning, it's not an easy ride but what is?

Happy not Christmas to you all, and if you are itching for a distraction tomorrow then give me that one tiny bit of insight that might help one day?",t3_ed7u74
fbicc7q,t1_fbh2bxr,"You are 100% right.  I can't let myself lose hope, I can't allow myself to sink into thinking that I'll never be able to overcome this, that it will always be this way.

I'll keep it in my mind, but I won't let it poison my resolve.  So often and so many times I find myself feeling hopeless, that I will never be able to change...it's so hard to slide back down the hill and look back up at all the progress you've lost...ah goddamn it's so hard...

I can't tell you how much I appreciate your words.

Thank you",t3_ed7u74
fbich9g,t1_fbgau1z,"I hurt her feelings with an outburst, and when she confronted me with it, I shut down completely and tried to make her leave me forever.

I can barely think about it now, it makes my face cramp in a wince that causes me to squeeze my eyes shut and shake my head in denial, but it happened.  I love her, and I told her to go.",t3_ed7u74
fbksne3,t1_fbjfdns,"I appreciate the words.  I agree with you, my partner and I have talked long and long about it being a muscle that I've never had to use before.  I've spent my life insulating myself from others, even through marriage and children, and committing to working out that empathy muscle and learning to use it reflexively has been the hardest thing I've ever done.

It helps to know others are going through the same thing.  For a long time I just felt like a disconnected ghost.",t3_ed7u74

fbzafsu,t1_fbyr1j1,"Hang in there.  When we become those self destructive balls of irrational offense and anger, I can speak from experience and tell you that they almost always-and I mean 99.9999% of the time-lead to the most shamefaced regret you could imagine 

And that's something you, as the partner of a narcissist, has to remember...not that it is YOUR responsibility to modify yourself for THEM, just something to keep in mind...

In my experience, shame is the biggest trigger for emotional shutdown, so when they come down from their self destructive anger, when all of that righteous steam runs out and they start seeing things clearly again...it can be a dangerous place for a narcissist, especially if it's a narcissist who is trying to change for their partner.

The shame of failing, AGAIN...the feeling of having lost all progress made AGAIN...that is when the voice in my head is the loudest, meaning the voice that tells me it isn't worth the trouble, I'm better off alone, I don't DESERVE a loving, caring relationship.  

It's hard to give advice without sounding like an asshole...I'm hardly in any place to give advice considering my track record...but just hang in there, and remember that when a narcissist tries and fails to fight that narcissism...that can be when they need the support the most.

I wish you a very calm, loving holiday, and good luck to you and your partner!",t3_ed7u74

fc4ozu8,t1_fbzafsu,"I wish I could show him your words so he knows he is not alone.

I want to scream right now, it's been one of those days - but thank you again, for being a crumb of comfort. As said before, it helps to see it from your side. It's been a hard few days on that front 

He's been drunk since I was last there, 6 days or so. probably the entire time. He has at least stayed in contact, mostly.,.. 
and off the class A's  But he's making himself so sick it's like a competition to see what gives up first - his body or his mind.

It's just so very fricking hard to watch the self destruction of someone you love, even if that someone does act like an arse at times. 

I don't know what else to do, other than hang in there to pick up the pieces and just crack on in with being me in the meantime, I promised not to judge him after all 

Thank you for the reply x",t3_ed7u74
fcm1u5s,t1_fc4ozu8,"I wish I could give you a hug right now.

I'm a narcissist, and I have very little in the way of empathy unless I'm really, really concentrating but I am so sorry for what you're going through.   

I've seen my partner reduced to tears and I felt nothing, I've seen her give up, I've seen her become endlessly frustrated and hopeless with me...and still she kept on.  She's still here, still with me and still loving me.

I don't know your partner or what he's going through, but I do have some experience with self destructive behavior...okay, a LOT of experience...and it sounds like he's in a rough place right now.  Unfortunately, for very self centered people like me, being in a rough place personally means making things rough for the people around us and especially the people that we love.  It isn't fair to you just like it isn't fair to my partner.  It's a terrible situation to be in for both of you.

It's a strange place to be in, trying to be of some comfort to the partner of an narcissist.  It's so easy to say ""don't give up"" when I'm guilty of pushing my partner to do exactly that.  What I can say is that I bet he is miserable. I bet that he is hiding from himself. I bet that he regrets treating you this way, but he may not see any way of stopping.  I don't have experience with what I've put my partner through, in my sad history when things get difficult I walk away, but I have experience trying to push away the person that I care about most.

There's no easy or fair way to deal with this for you.  Your partner is going to have to find a way to be more conscious of his actions and emotions just like I have, and even now I fail and struggle with almost regularity.  But if there's anything I can say that will comfort you, it is that if he cares about you he will not give up trying.  He will feel wretched, he will hate himself when he fails, but he will not stop trying until he finds the path.  

And while it is wonderful to be supportive of him, it is absolutely alright to put your foot down and demand that he LISTEN to you.  I would still be living entirely in my own head if my partner hadn't insisted that I look at what I was doing to hurt her.  It took me far too long to see, but now that I have...I am different.  I have hope. 

I wish you all the best, Hiding.  I hope for you as I hope for myself, and that we find our way through this.  Thank you for supporting your partner, even when it feels like he is doing everything be can to push you away...you are not alone.",t3_ed7u74
