fbvkrr6,t3_eeixru,"It depends on how smart and special you are. I am *very special and very smart* (jk), so the diagnosis didn't take me off guard as I had already diagnosed myself. In fact, the only reason I accepted the diagnosis was because I had discovered it BEFORE the shrink. Y'know, this type of solipsistic cognition is actually not smart at all, and has ruined my life until now, but I stressed it here so you can see narcissism in action. Try to listen to other people, that's what I want to convey. But, if you find it very hard, you might be a narc.",t3_eeixru

fbu4ife,t3_eeixru,"To answer your question yes, you can. I was self aware long before I was diagnosed, but I don’t think it’s all that common. There are still plenty who are self aware before a diagnosis though, even if it’s not the majority.",t3_eeixru
fbw5j0o,t3_eeixru,"Now that is a tricky question!!!

I have diagnosed NPD...

It took 23 years to receive that diagnosis. Therefore, I believe I am qualified enough to provide my humble opinion. It is humble as I am now aware of my diagnosis and, in total honesty, my life has only now, at 39 years of age, turned bright...

Enough about me!! Lols

I have several answers to your question. However, I will attempt to be as succinct as possible:

1. No. 
NPD is a personality disorder. As human beings we do as our minds' say. Whether good or bad, we are all  in control of our actions. I have alway took the wrong turn at the cross roads.

2. Maybe.
I always knew that there was an abnormal 'clicking' in my head. I knew  I was different to other folk. Everything was different. Literally everything, everyone and every choice I made. I suspected NPD as (retrospective thinking) I could never make sense to myself; I would provide amazing advice but would behave quite the opposite.


I would like to add that the  'label' NARCISSIT is not what NPD means. I know plenty of cunts that one could label a NARCISSIT. If one is  a cunt, who regularly trample over people and simply behave, consistently, like a cunt, then you're just a cunt. No personality disorder, just a cunt..

I hope that you have found my opinion useful.

fc0tke3,t3_eeixru,"Pretty late but I don’t think it’s that common. I’ve yet to meet a person with any personality disorder who was self aware before their diagnosis, and in most cases they either find out by going to therapy for different issues like depression or anxiety, or they’re forced into therapy by family members for acting out (like me for example).
I wouldn’t say it’s impossible though. There’s a lot of mental awareness nowadays which makes it easier for people to learn about different mental illnesses, after all, I highly doubt anyone with any personality disorder believed that they’re “normal” before their diagnosis.",t3_eeixru
