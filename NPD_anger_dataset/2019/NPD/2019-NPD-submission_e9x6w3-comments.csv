fami236,t3_e9x6w3,"lack of object constancy is a bitch. it feels impossible to care for someone when they aren’t there, because you completely forget about how they act and what they do for you. it’s extreme out of sight out of mind thinking. an emotional connection for me isn’t a thing, but i can kind of get an idea of what it is. it’s more of a feeling like you’re on the same wavelength, you feel what the other is feeling at the same time and to the same degree. since we lack empathy we can’t do that, and that’s why it’s near impossible to have a true emotional connection like that. if it does happen it often just happens by coincidence or if the other person somehow empathizes with you. for me i feel very dull emotions when around other people, and since a lot of people just feel their emotions normally and not half assed like i do they don’t really connect to that. that’s why it’s so hard to empathize with us since our emotions are so dull around other people, at least in my case. it’s like our feelings are right below the radar of empathy, it’s so dull that they can’t really register or feel that emotion like we do around others. it’s also pretty weird because when we’re alone we tend to feel those emotions but amplified and above the empathy radar, they’re too intense to be detected. so even if we were “emotional” around others they would still have trouble empathizing and holding an emotional connection. it’s like we never normally feel our emotions, it’s either too dull or too amplified. that’s why we can’t empathize and nobody else can empathize with us, because only we do that. i see it as empathy is like a line, people who feel their emotions normally are on that line, they feel it at the appropriate level that normal people do. people like that are those that can empathize, and be empathized with. people like us however, are off that line constantly. either we’re above, or below it, so we can’t feel empathy or be empathized with. my theory is that true empaths also feel their emotions as either too dull or too amplified, but they can also feel them normally. those are the people that can empathize with us, but since they’re so rare, they often don’t. that’s my whole take on it anyway.

edit: i also think that’s definitely why empath/narc relationships work so well and why we attract eachother so often, we can actually have true emotional connections to eachother. they can empathize with our emotions unlike the majority of people. we’re both so rare in the world though so it never usually happens, but when it does it’s often symbiotic and pretty functional in theory.",t3_e9x6w3
fanyzmz,t3_e9x6w3,"If you believe the trauma theory of NPD/ your NPD was caused by trauma at a young age, it’s because we have “turned off” the part of us that connects to others, as a defense mechanism. To connect emotionally you have to allow yourself to be vulnerable, stop the performance, be in touch with your own feelings and also turn your attention to the other person and what they might be thinking and feeling. It is a lot of work to do consciously, what normies do without thinking about it. 

I think I have started to feel emotional connection in “real time”.. it feels overwhelming at times and yet also I think I now understand why people value each other and relationships. There is a lot more there than just going through the motions.",t3_e9x6w3

famvcdl,t3_e9x6w3,"try literature.

if you are really that behind on the curve, start with erotic or pornographic.

Then look at for example Ulysses. 2 ordinary guys in some ordinary sea-side town have an amazing day. of course live is unfulfilling if you don't know any magic.

using the word sea-side alone gives me chills.",t3_e9x6w3
fanvucf,t3_e9x6w3,Try not to over complicate it. It's feeling understood by others and you understanding them. Probably the reason you visit this subreddit is because you can relate with the experience of people who post here. That's an emotional connection.,t3_e9x6w3
fdqrrq9,t3_e9x6w3,Yes I can relate I feel like there's no one in my life whose absence would make me sad not even my parents. I feel like I don't have an emotional connection with anyone.,t3_e9x6w3
famzt4d,t1_fami236,"Wow you hit the nail on the head. My previous girlfriend was an empath and I was drawn to her in ways I couldn't explain, she gave me empathy that I had never felt in my life and in all honesty showed me what love was truly supposed to be like. The relationship worked well for the most part but I hadn't gotten to the point of self-awareness with my NPD and I imploded the relationship as we so often do. 

I think many people assume narcissists don't feel emotions at all but I can vouch that its the opposite, we have developed a coping mechanism in which we turn off our empathy due to being overly vulnerable in early childhood situations. I feel that what you said about losing connection to another when the person isn't there is very true, I have always had a hard time with maintaining that empathetic connection and wondered why I was so broken. 

And then, like you said, we have those emotions rebound in a heightened sense when we are finally alone, leading to vast feelings of shame and guilt. Its almost like a reverse manic episode. For years I assumed it was simply depression or bipolar disorder, but no other symptoms matched. Now I finally see why I have had such trouble with empathy and close connections.",t3_e9x6w3
faozp77,t1_famm2qc,"I also don't have NPD, but I feel that it's at least somewhat relevant to ask whether you always feel this connection even when you are not around them, how many people you have an emotional connection with, and who these people are to you.",t3_e9x6w3
fao2n3y,t1_famvcdl,Yeah books seriously help. I took some lit classes in college and read a bunch of shit I never would have read before. James Joyce made me feel all kinds of stuff I hadn't ever thought about before. Really gives you some perspective that we are missing as narcs.,t3_e9x6w3
fan3aph,t1_famzt4d,"dude i so relate to the reverse manic episode thing. i always thought i was bipolar or something before i got my diagnosis, i wrote off grandiosity as mania and my self aware state as depression, thus thinking its bipolar. but it wasn’t, it was just the constant battle between the two ends of my self esteem. it’s like our emotions are desensitized in front of others, we don’t connect with them so we don’t feel with them, and it’s a duller feeling. but alone they become hypersensitive because they’ve been pretty much suppressed when we were with people beforehand. it’s that rebound that never seems to land where it should. take it as like a rubber band. if you hold it back, and then let go, it’s going to end up going forward. that’s what it’s like when you go from being around people to being alone. it doesn’t land in that middle area where emotions are felt normally, it goes way past it because of how far it was held back. you go from feeling a hollow version of emotions to an over the top version that’s too much to handle. now with object constancy i’ve pondered some theories but i haven’t quite found something that fits it. out of sight out of mind is just a weird concept to explain in the first place, but to the degree that we have it’s even more confusing. i just know that we go from being with a friend and then suddenly forgetting they ever existed until were with them again. and it’s not like we completely forget who they are, we know who they are and what they do and everything, but we don’t remember the connection. we know they’re our friend but we don’t *feel* like they’re our friend. i have no idea *why* this happens but it’ll be something i’m gonna think about and look into for sure.",t3_e9x6w3
fan3tly,t1_fan3aph,"I'm glad you can relate to my description. And yea out of sight out of mind is so weird.  Like if my friends leave out of town for 6 months I often just forget about them. I don't lose our friendship, and the moment they're talking to me we are back at it like we never skipped a beat. But I just lose focus of the connections if that makes sense. Like I can't feel them anymore. 

I thought this was normal for so long but now I get that its my lack of consistent empathy. 

As for the rebound effect, it has crippled me many times. Its too often that I get an episode and start to collapse inwards from the overflow of stored emotions, leading me to further block them out in other situations. The cycle only continues. 

The key in being healthy I think is first trying to let ourselves feel these emotions at full force, to embrace what empathy we have left. With more emotion on the proper side, the rebounds become less potent. And with this, we can emotionally stabilise. From there, as we establish a basepoint, we can start to fix our personal internal issues.",t3_e9x6w3
fan7ivx,t1_fan3tly,"that’s a very interesting solution you got there. i think it definitely has potential to work but the only thing is i don’t know how motivated people will be to try it. that’s really the deciding factor in whether it helps or it doesn’t. i do think you’re on to something for sure though. honestly i would say i’m actually very emotionally stable right now, but that’s because i’ve been so socially isolated for a few months. i just didn’t let my emotions rebound this time so maybe that’s why i’m pretty stable at the moment. it’s pretty interesting to think about though, and useful too.",t3_e9x6w3
