fbhw3dq,t3_edgmfl,"That's an interesting point. Who diagnosed you in the first place? I get told by friends all the time I can't possibly have ASPD because I'm ""too nice"", but a PD isn't measured on how much pain you can cause others. It's not how we present outwardly a lot of the time, I have at least traits of NPD according to my therapist and whilst people see me as modest, cooperative and sociable, they don't know that beneath all that I'm competitive, obsessed with being the best, contemptuous and extremely cynical of almost everyone I know.",t3_edgmfl
fbhviik,t3_edgmfl,It's possible your therapist is humouring you.,t3_edgmfl
fbhwrdi,t1_fbhw3dq,"Well I was diagnosed in arguably one of the worst mental states of my entire life. I wasn’t myself at all- totally consumed by my traumas and ready to end it all basically. I’ve gotten A LOT of therapy since then, and since I’ve grown to know myself more beyond my struggles and mental illnesses, the NPD diagnosis has made less and less sense. I’ll admit that I do have some narcissistic tendencies, but not to the point where it warrants a diagnosis. I’m definitely a little confused though, because this contradicts everything I thought I knew about personality disorders (i.e., they’re irreversible)",t3_edgmfl
fbhvp48,t1_fbhviik,"True, but the problem is that no one in my life that I’ve asked believed the diagnosis in the first place. Wouldn’t the people I know be impacted by my supposed narcissism?",t3_edgmfl
fbi2ckk,t1_fbhwrdi,I totally get what you mean though. Me at 19-25? Malignant as fuck narcissist. Now? Probably not at all.,t3_edgmfl
fbi2am3,t1_fbhwrdi,"Im sorry to hear that, but I think I've read that as we get older we may sometimes come to have fewer symptoms to the point where we technically still have the disorder but couldn't be diagnosable if we were to present now for the first time",t3_edgmfl
