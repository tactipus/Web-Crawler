All people have some Narcissistic traits. They aren't always bad traits to have, as long as you aren't using them to hurt other people.",t3_e7l2kc

I was with my ex for eleven years. He had Narcissistic traits, if he wasn't a full Narcissist, and I loved him to the end of the universe and back, and he loved me probably just as much in his own way. We were very toxic to each other, it was a very unhealthy relationship because we were mentally unwell and both weren't aware of our delusions. I left him very suddenly. One day I just woke up and found someone else, and a month and a half later I left. No notice. No warning. I made up my mind and left, because I am impulsive, because I am Borderline. 

Could have been any Cluster B disorder, or could be just anything. Sometimes people just aren't good people, or are generally good people but don't do the right thing sometimes. However, if she did have a Cluster B PD, then you could have very easily picked up traits of a Cluster B disorder, even traits from one that she didn't have. Most of us Cluster B's are the product of other Cluster B's.

Later in life, once you have fully developed and can't develop a PD, you can still pick up the traits. You pick them up for the same reason we did, it just wasn't part of your development so it wasn't so detrimental. 

You should send me a message or a chat message, and we can talk about it, because I'd have to ask you questions about both of your behaviors to even give you an idea of what you should be considering the problem is.",t3_e7l2kc
fa11jxs,t1_fa0vqxs,"i don’t think anyone’s a narcissist in this situation. some people are just shitty and cheat. some just fall in love with other people without meaning to. doesn’t mean either of you are a narcissist. i feel like that’s a common misconception, that all people who are terrible in relationships are narcissists. they aren’t! there’s a very certain criteria for the disorder and it’s also very rare, so most posts or stories you see about the narc ex boyfriend aren’t actually about a true narcissist. hope this helps.",t3_e7l2kc
