fa2g9td,t3_e7g84u,I feel like narcissist for most ppl is just an insulting slur rather than a legit personality disorder.,t3_e7g84u
fa0o7ab,t3_e7g84u,You have no idea how much this is still pissing me off. Lol.,t3_e7g84u
f9z7cmh,t3_e7g84u,"These responses shouldn't be allowed in accordance to r/NPD 's rules, they should be reported amd I hope they get banned or somethingg :))",t3_e7g84u
fa9hcyq,t3_e7g84u,"Does it hurt your feelings when they say that?

I wonder because NPD is a real personality disorder so they are essentially making fun of the mentally ill for their mental illness.

Do they do that to people with schizophrenia, Touretteâ€™s, cancer, or Alzheimerâ€™s as well?

Very poor form on their part: making fun of people with disorders for their disorders.",t3_e7g84u
f9zb7x8,t3_e7g84u,"Sometimes I win an argument and the other person goes to my comment history looking for something to discredit me, they usually don't find anything but my activity in this sub.

Does that count?",t3_e7g84u
f9ze6qk,t3_e7g84u,"I'm curious, what did you respond to this person?",t3_e7g84u

fa05d39,t1_fa04lmo,true. itâ€™s stupid.,t3_e7g84u
fa7ylsw,t1_fa2g9td,"oh for sure, iâ€™d say the majority of neurotypicals donâ€™t even know that narcissism is a legit condition. they just use it interchangeably with bad person or abuser, and they constantly preach to stay away from us because weâ€™re all terrible when thatâ€™s just not the truth. we really do need more education on the whole topic of personality disorders, especially cluster bâ€™s, weâ€™re the most understood.",t3_e7g84u
fa0qn21,t1_fa0o7ab,"oh iâ€™ve been dealing with it all day, iâ€™m still hashing it out with a few people in that other post lol",t3_e7g84u
f9z8i42,t1_f9z7cmh,"i totally agree! theyâ€™re lucky theyâ€™re even allowed to comment, i mean we arenâ€™t even allowed in their spaces at all. i definitely think restrictions should be harsher.",t3_e7g84u
faaas22,t1_fa9hcyq,"of course it hurts, i mean especially since itâ€™s a personality disorder. itâ€™s who i am as a person, unlike some other mental illnesses. its like i have to take it personally. and of course they wouldnâ€™t make fun of any other disorder, theyâ€™re just incredibly biased against us. it really does suck.",t3_e7g84u
f9zdmxs,t1_f9zb7x8,"iâ€™ve been there, for sure bro",t3_e7g84u
f9zey44,t1_f9ze6qk,"i just kept trying to tell them that this is a subreddit for support of NPD individuals, and that this isnâ€™t the place for them to complain and insult us. i got pretty aggressive towards the end though, ignorance really puts me past my breaking point",t3_e7g84u
fa0vpe5,t1_fa0ts22,"didnâ€™t ask for your opinion! most of my posts arenâ€™t gossiping at all, but ignorance will have you believing otherwise i assume.",t3_e7g84u

fa9hgo4,t1_f9zey44,Itâ€™s fine - they earned it deliberately through their behavior. They are abusing you for having a mental illness. What a sicko.,t3_e7g84u
fa127b0,t1_fa0vpe5,Omg yaaaawwwn,t3_e7g84u
fa9hi0e,t1_fa127b0,Haha so youâ€™re the sad sack that abuses the mentally ill for having their illness. Iâ€™ll make sure to keep gossiping about you baby!,t3_e7g84u
