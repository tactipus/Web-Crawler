fb1jz2z,t3_eb26gi,"Relationships with those who I think genuinely care about me, and who show love to the point of accepting even our worst flaws, are particularly difficult for me to let go of. 

I think, as a narcissist, we become good at burning bridges early on. We are outward optimists but internal pessimists, and so when things start to go badly we will usually be fine just letting go of someone, rather than deal with the consequences. Save face for ourselves and those around us, or so we think.

But, when someone seems to break beyond that barrier, and loves us in a way we didn't receive (usually as a child), we become overly attached to that person. I see it as a way for us to vicariously love ourselves, not in an egotistical way as other superficial relationships, but to start believing actual good things about our personality beyond that typical narcissistic supply. These people are generally empaths, people who experience love and empathy at a higher level than the average person. Its why they can connect with a narcissist on a deeper level that typical people cannot. This ""ideal love"" opens us up, albeit slowly.

When we lose that person, it feels like losing a part of yourself. For most of us, we lack the ability to love ourselves unconditionally. Being on that receiving end, ""ideal love,"" makes us feel whole when we are with them. So once we've experienced it, we build grand ideas of our life with that love. When we lose it, we fall back to the empty reality. 

It all comes back to the fact that narcissists don't truly love themselves. So when we are alone, we are forced to remember times we've actually felt the warmth of being loved. 

I'm sorry you are going through these feelings of losing someone you loved, and who loved you. I know what its like to have dream after dream of that person, waking up thinking they're still in your life, before the sadness sets in. I wish you the best though.",t3_eb26gi
fb1iai2,t3_eb26gi,"Holy fuck yes. I was in a relationship with someone who loved me for literally half a decade but my ""ideal love"" landed on a childhood friend who I barely knew! It destroyed my relationship with someone who was genuinely good for me because I kept chasing what I thought would be perfection!

Turns out I got closer to ""perfection"" and her life is a fucking mess. She isnt even close to what I wanted her to be, which was a panacea. I lost someone good for me over my obsession with ideal love.

But actually it was this collapse of my ideal love that helped me awaken to my narcissistic bullshit tendencies so I'm trying to see it as a blessing in disguise. Realizing there is no perfect someone out there for you, and more importantly that it isnt worth trying to be perfect to attain something that doesnt exist, is my fundamental cure. 

You figure out who you truly are, and then you go find someone who likes to be truly themself with you in the same room. That's true love versus ideal love. One is real and worth pursuing, the other is a trap.

fb1mqvt,t1_fb1jz2z,"I said this exact thing last night about the love I was hung up on for so long. I don't tend to believe in empaths most of the time because there's a lot of toxic empath culture but this ex is someone I genuinely believed to be an empath and I had never ever once in my life ever experienced any thing like that so I think I clung on for dear life. Worst thing was, I was dismissive in the relationship. He'd come over, I'd feel warm and fuzzy and loved and he'd be reciprocating, I'd tell him to go home, i'd pine for him, he'd try to contact me, I wouldn't answer the phone. 

You're right that narcissists don't love ourselves, a lot of people get that very wrong about us. It's because we don't love ourselves that we have to front that we love ourselves, whether we are aware we're doing it or not. I always think if I project an image of someone gorgeous and powerful and generally too good to miss, I may end up believing it. Those are the easiest and emptiest relationships I have - the ones where the person falls in love with who I'm pretending to be. I think you're right, the people that are hard to let go of are the people who immediately cut past the bullshit and aren't bitter about it, just like ""yes I think you're great and wonderful but also I think you're in pain"". Can really catch us off guard. 

And thankyou so much. It's been a long journey but I'm finally getting to a place where I think I can start to let go. I'm supposed to go to his grave soon because I have never been (classic out of sight, out of mind... or rather, out of sight, obsessively in mind), but I think it might be time.",t3_eb26gi

fb1k3oy,t1_fb1iai2,"God this is such a good reply, thankyou so much! That's the thing, I find myself pining over things that possibly never would have worked out anyway. I had a best friend years ago that I once hooked up with and in times of loneliness my brain is like, oh hey maybe you should've ended up with him? And within moments that thought turns into, ""everything would be perfect now and you would be so happy together and that might have been your only shot at being truly loved"", it's exhausting as it happens because I know in my heart it's a ridiculous thought. I really do think a lot of it stems from the unloved child part of us that most of us here have, just latching onto whatever idea of love comes along because we have no idea what to really look for, but I detest how much I feel like I sound like my hideous mother. She's in her fifties and all she can do is tell the same ten anecdotes about the same two men and how beautiful and amazing she once was. It's absolutely pathetic. I hope to god I never sound like her when I do occasionally talk about my ex. I mean I know he died so it's different but still, the last thing I would ever want would be to be someone who only exists in their own past.",t3_eb26gi

Wow this was literally my exact experience. Scary to think how similar, actually. Its like, until we lost them, we took them for granted. For me, I was too young and naive to know what that relationship truly meant until it was gone. I hadn't the self awareness nor maturity to approach the relationship with the respect she deserved.

And I completely agree on the ""people who cut through the bullshit."" I once told my empath ex (gf at the time) that I loved her precisely because she could call me out on my BS. I didn't even really know why I needed that but I certainly felt it was love coming from a good place. Never felt like an attack, but genuine care and empathy for our hurt. Its like they can see parts of us that we have blocked out for so long. That's where we get this ideal love.

Best of luck on your journey. Take the time you need for yourself, but you also may be surprised by the goodness that pain and sorrow can bring. Spend too much time blocking out emotion, and you are left with emptiness. But some of the most fulfilling moments are when you can just feel sad, and not have to worry about it. Being sad for sadness sake. You lost a partner you loved, that's never going to be easy. But you still have lots of life and love left. Stay strong!",t3_eb26gi
fb1v40h,t1_fb1k3oy,"A) Shoot him a text if its at all feasible? You **definitely** won't find perfection, it doesn't exist. But best friends who you hook up with are generally good partner material.

fb211ld,t1_fb1qo0a,"Everything you said rang very true with me, right down to feeling sad for the sake of it which I struggle with owing more to my ASPD than anything else I think. I often dont know when I'm sad and convert it to anger or bitterness or vengefulness and a huge part of getting better I guess is learning our feelings and letting them happen. I certainly took my ex for granted some times and I too was young (21 when we started dating and he was 31) but I think we are also prone to punishing ourselves for not giving love perfectly too - we probably gave more than we think but are so prone to perfectionism it doesn't feel like it could ever have been enough.",t3_eb26gi

fb21arg,t1_fb201du,"I'm not possessive or controlling but have certainly craved chaos. The ex in question was quite an obsessive relationship on both sides, quite theatrical and stuff (both poets, both mentally ill lol) and maybe that's what I miss, falsely conflating drama with true emotion? We did have the true emotion but maybe we think drama is a necessary part of showing love?",t3_eb26gi
fb239b0,t1_fb211ld,">a huge part of getting better I guess is learning our feelings and letting them happen.

This is key for sure. I think we have the capacity to regrow our empathy but it takes a lot of willingness to search for those feelings and experience them. Normal people feel them without any effort but for us it involves an active process, and I think many of us don't realize that it is a lot of work to get that back. Work that doesn't always feel ""good.""

>I think we are also prone to punishing ourselves for not giving love perfectly too - we probably gave more than we think but are so prone to perfectionism it doesn't feel like it could ever have been enough.

This is also very true. Its sad to me that the love I gave simply wasn't enough, even though from my perspective I was loving to the best of my ability at the time. But its another reminder that no one is perfect, and life is all about perspective. Learning, growing, and being introspective of these things can help us take charge of our lives.

I have made it an effort to have hope beyond what I think I *should* be. That maybe there is more to it than obsessing over this perfect version of a person we are trying to achieve. We invest so much of our personality into logistics and disappointing ourselves when we don't live up to our own grand expectations. But there's something to be said about just *living* and going with it, hopeful that we will be better than the day before. 

Of course I'm still new to all of this so take what I say with a grain (or mountain) of salt. But I refuse to believe we are broken beyond repair.",t3_eb26gi

We can do better and that self awareness is half the battle won. Of course there are narcissists who have no self awareness and want to do worse, my mother is typical of this kind.
