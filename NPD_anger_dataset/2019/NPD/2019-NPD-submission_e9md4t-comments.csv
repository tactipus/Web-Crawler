fal0ee3,t3_e9md4t,"i haven't read it yet, but this book is also highly recommended in r/CPTSD. thought it might help to know that there are a lot of people without NPD who can still relate to _some_ of your struggles. disconnected relationships, rumination, emotions overpowering logic, lack of identity, and self-esteem issues, to name a few.

>Alice Miller writes, ""When I used the word 'gifted' in the title, I had in mind neither children who receive high grades in school nor children talented in a special way.

Without this 'gift' offered us by nature, we would not have survived.""",t3_e9md4t
