I myself sometimes get jealous of other people getting positive attention and so on. But for me, it's not because I don't feel I get enough positive attention, but rather, I often feel critized too often during times when I am not doing well. It sometimes just bugs me to the core, and I just wanna yell, ""make it stop!"" Then, I go into isolation mode and get lonely to avoid criticism. I often keep to myself when not doing well. Because for me, no attention is better than negative attention.",t3_9wxeg5

You can't make this shit up. 

Until you're ready to hold yourself accountable for your own bad behavior, NPD-caused or not, you will never make progress. You don't want help. You don't want diagnosis. You don't want to cope. You want us to tell you the secret to how to get nsupply, rage, and just be an asshole in general without it affecting your life in a negative way and I'll say it again for the people in the back:

***It doesn't fucking exist.***

The social pressures that apply to everyone and the consequences that follow if you don't play nice also apply to everyone. You cannot escape it.

Change or die alone, your choice.",t3_9wxeg5

e9oja6q,t1_e9oip3m,"There's a whole history with this person, as pointed out by the poster above. 

I know narcs can be useless - I know a few - but it tends to be the case that many are quite effective and use their traits to take what they want from others instead of sitting there sulking about it.

Also, it is next to impossible to feel even one grain of sympathy for the OP because, as the other poster suggested, OP is just argumentative and annoying. OP posts for attention only - he doesn't want help - he wants people to feel sorry for him.",t3_9wxeg5

e9phf0e,t1_e9pg4uc,">anybody who criticizes me is a fake account"" we are done here you are a lost cause

You said that not me. I never actually said you or others who criticize me are fake. Your quote is fake news. I did say that there are accounts pretending to be me, and its all the same dude. I have been accused multiple times of lying about iy and it just proves how society is a depraved retched.  Because no one will listen to victims of cyber stalking or bullying. That's why I have my local PD on the case of this one detestable human being who is setting out to make my life a living hell by pretending to be me, defaming me, using my photos, following me on my personal social media, and identity theft. This is a crime, which is why I've contacted law enforcement. I will get my justice",t3_9wxeg5
