In it, the guy says it takes something like 20-50 years of therapy to develop a real sense of self. At that point, I thought there is zero upside to attempting to ""fix"" NPD if thats the case. 

Best life possible, in that case, means optimizing validation and minimizing consequences.

Sex. I feel like if I was a woman, it would be easier. But then, my standards for what picked me up would probably be higher. I'm just saying this because I always seem to feel the best after I get laid. But who doesnt?

Money. Money makes people want to be nice to you, blow smoke up your ass. It also solves a lot of the consequence aspect. You can literally pay to have people in your life feeding you, through employment, or ""charity."" 

So, I'd focus on being as fit and rich as possible in terms of ""optimization"" for a narcissist. Easier said than done. For someone like me, the money train is never going to come in, and I've topped out on fitness, realistically. So its pretty depressing and bleak in the face of learning about this stuff. Doesn't seem to be a lot to gain in terms of happiness from working on it.",t3_a1bkzk

eaqgc27,t1_eap1tbv,"Hey it doesn't have to take that long. People who don't have a sense of self (or more accurately have a fragmented self/are estranged from the self; depending on your perspective) and have cptsd can get better in a few years most of the time. So can people with other PD's. Imo the only reason NPD is any different is because of our penchant for denial/repression or our level of toxic shame which stops us from being honest even with ourselves. Once this hurdle is overcome improving is rapid. I'm speaking from experience, I can feel myself taking a step back due to denial/shame. It's okay, you're not too far gone, none of us are",t3_a1bkzk
eaqhbg6,t1_eap1tbv,"About the 20-50 year thing... That's what it may take to change someone's personality completely. But that doesn't mean that there couldn't be some meaningful changes in a shorter period. I'm far from perfect but I'm a very different person than I was 10 or 5 years ago.

I personally think that depending on such unreliable sources of happiness is not a good strategy. If having a steady supply of sex and money was easy everybody would have them. And most narcs get bored easily so even if he was one of the lucky ones, it doesn't guarantee happiness.",t3_a1bkzk

eaohher,t1_eaodq38,"All good, I understand you.

Your question was ""what is the optimal way to live as a narcissist?"". The optimal way is to reduce your pathology and live a mentally healthy, constructive, productive life, these are anathema to pathological narcissism. So my advice was for optimising your life, rather than optimising your tactics to feed your narcissism.",t3_a1bkzk
