ec73wyj,t3_a7yvgs,"If you're happy the way you are and you're hurting no one, why do you want to change your personality? 

There's nothing inherently wrong with enjoying attention and competition. Most neurotypical people enjoy attention, like to feel special and think of themselves as being better than they objectively are. Behaving selfishly from time to time is pretty normal too, and doesn't mean you're disordered. Noticing and correcting your ways is part of maturing.

When you need inordinate amounts of attention (more than you can realistically get) to function or else you spiral down into depression, you behave in dishonest or abusive ways to get it, and you need everyone else to recognize you as special and superior or else you go into a rage, that'd be a problem.

Most people with NPD that want to improve learn to cognitively navigate the empathy impairment in the ways you said, even if they don't get to feel it.",t3_a7yvgs

ec7ygm1,t3_a7yvgs,The most helpful treatment I know of is strong psychedelics: ayahuasca if you can spend a week in South America at a reputable retreat centre; psilocybin if you can't; LSD or MDMA if you can be 100% sure of its purity.,t3_a7yvgs

>If you're happy the way you are and you're hurting no one, why do you want to change your personality?

That's when my OCD kicks in: my current obsession involves religions and world philosophies. I am afraid that I can't continue the way I am due to the dogmas, even if I don't know in which religion or philosophy I believe more. But there is the thing: all them condemn pride. I am very narcissistic... I am driven by my vanity in all of my hobbies and even in my particular way of talking. Even if the people usually enjoy it I wonder if I am doing the right thing or living in the right way. My guilt trip is what inserted me in my current dilemma. And I wonder if someone who barely feel emotions and have so much delight in being special can change by option, or if its a genetic condition or something else that can't be changed.

But then again, all religions condemn pride. I am embracing it when I am keeping these thoughts that I am better, that I am special. When I notice that in all of my life I didn't do any valid contribution to the world and took so much energy from it, mostly from my parents, I can see that is messed up. 

With the dogmas condemning pride, vanity, competition, feeling of being superior, I wonder what do I do with myself. I am over the fence: to try to make my personality die/change and supress my narcissistic desires or to embrace my personality and use it the in the optimal way trying to practice more cognitive empathy (and keeping my fantasies to myself)?

I am not the kind that need more attention than I can realistically obtain. I just want to enjoy the attention I get for my talents and my style. I am totally ok if people disapproves it... I love myself even if people think that I am ugly or my style is ridiculous. I love to self express and the admiration I get as a byproduct. I just want to feel alive without feeling guilty.

That is why I asked if this disorders have a cure: I am over the fence if its worth trying to reset my core or if that is futile and one cannot change this kind of feelings... this inner comparisons that I make that make me feel good even if I don't tell them to anyone. ",t3_a7yvgs
ec7z2js,t1_ec7ygm1,I considered this. And I am from South america. But I use antidepressants and I think its not a good idea to engage on such heavy substances. This allied with my fear of triggering schizophrenia due to my schizoid patterns and my father hearing voices for days after a heavy use of MJ makes me discard this route. ,t3_a7yvgs
ec8pv7q,t1_ec7jdqb,"I agree with /u/lostmyselfinyourlies that narcissism without self-steem and/or relationship issues would be just grandiosity, pride, vanity or whatever. Just a personality quirk, not a disorder.

Religion has a long history of depicting perfectly natural human experiences as sins. I wouldn't sweat it unless it's causing trouble to you, or other people are recurrently telling you that's causing them trouble.",t3_a7yvgs
ec8lwsp,t1_ec7jdqb,"If you are truly happy with who you are, rather than just afraid to change, then you probably don't have NPD.  Most narcs think they are pieces of shit deep down and that's why they need constant validation from others. It sounds like the narcissistic traits you talk of are probably feelings of grandiosity which are part of SPD. 

I always suggest therapy for anyone who is struggling with themselves. You can concentrate on working on your ocd, you don't have to change anything that you don't want to, but sometimes there are parts that need to change for you to be happy that you are very used to and don't know who you'll be without them. This can be scary but part of therapy is learning new skills to deal with things. Good luck and well done for asking for help. It's always the first step. ",t3_a7yvgs
ec8p76m,t1_ec7z2js,Good judgment bud. Avoid psychedelics like the plague if you're at risk for schizophrenia. Even weed is contraindicated in those cases.,t3_a7yvgs

I am not sure if I follow. I do have a huge self-steem, but no relationship issues anymore (I learned how to manage my NPD to not hurt people). I am actually developing relationship issues now that I am getting depressed with the obligation of killing the ego: my parents are getting depressed with myself depressed, and I am not going out because I can't be sponteneous.",t3_a7yvgs
ec8yyss,t1_ec8lwsp,"Trust me, I do have NPD. I just became worried about it and got my insights about how I got people hurt in the past because I kinda had this experience that could be interpreted as divine intervention suggesting that I need to ""die for myself"". I was being happy, when all the philosophy in spirituality says you are in the wrong path, you start to feel intimidated enough to not just turn your back. That being said, I got this dilemma of my will vs my obligation.",t3_a7yvgs
ec8z97j,t1_ec8yyss,"OK, I would still suggest therapy, whatever you have. We need people to guide us in these journeys. ",t3_a7yvgs
