eb8texo,t3_a3frvz,"Setting goals is good and I would tell you, also, to take it a day at a time! Scale down your timeline, keep things manageable. One. Day. At. A. Time. Then those days will add up. You can even track it, almost like an addict would (this is what I do). I.E. it has been 3 days since I have had an (external) Narcissistic outburst/episode.... Soon that will turn/build into 15 days, then 30 days. At 30 days that is 1/12 of your year, one out of every livable days of that year, that you were able to go without being a crazy person. That would be something notable you could hold onto. Then keep it going. 

Even if you mess up, which you will, you are HUMAN (not just NPD). Keep tally of your mistakes. Then you could potentially say ""okay, I was great for 22 days and then had an outburst... was good for 8 more then had another. But that is only 2 incidents this month!"" compare to the next month, and then the next. compare season to season. year to year.

Just, accountability, is the main thing. And only YOU can keep yourself accountable bc anyone else you will try to manipulate if you're anything like me. Some days will be better than others. My thoughts are still GROSSLY disordered/pretty sick but I have stopped being outwardly abusive, for the most part, and my life is 100x better (as well as the lives of those that actually love my crazy ass, eh hem). It is a start. Hoping one day my thoughts can be controlled/subdued, as my actions have started to be. ",t3_a3frvz
eb9hk5g,t3_a3frvz,"You don’t just realize you have a problem and solve it bro, you have to LIVE with this problem specifically. Best thing you can do is not view it as a problem necessarily.

These traits help you in so many other areas, yet problems in others. The only thing is really does is make you different from others, but you’re still human. All it does is leave you with some advantages and some shortcomings for you when facing the world.",t3_a3frvz

ebfae7d,t3_a3frvz,"Read this post from /u/TheMightyEggplant, it has lots of good advice: [https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/9kaqfi/im\_a\_narcissist\_that\_wants\_to\_change\_looking\_for/e6z45z4/](https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/9kaqfi/im_a_narcissist_that_wants_to_change_looking_for/e6z45z4/)

Here are a couple articles of self-help for people with NPD for two particular situations (devaluation and rage):

Apart from defining goals as others have said, have you considered removing yourself from your what's triggering you? That is, isolating yourself from your partner, or even breaking up.

I know I would have not made the improvements I made if I hadn't spent a long time on my own. Solitude is a great teacher. It makes you be more appreciative of the people you miss, and makes you more sincere with yourself, since there's no crowd to impress and no ""enemy"" to keep up with (because sometimes we treat our partners as our enemies, like they're someone to overpower, as if they're trying to hurt us).

Even if you find impossible to keep yourself under control around your partner, there's always alternatives to abuse, even if they're as drastic as breaking up or even removing yourself from existence. Not saying that you should kill yourself, but thinking like that helps me put things into perspective. If an issue is not as drastic as to warrant such measures, it doesn't warrant violence either. It helps me concentrate in seeking alternatives for self-soothing / conflict resolution.

For example, I may be angry that my partner didn't react like I wanted. My natural reaction may be cruel to him, but since that's unacceptable, I'd rather leave. Does the wrongdoing warrant terminating the relationship, because I'm so hurt that our bond is never going to recover? Most of the time it isn't the case, even if it feels like it for a short time.

Another thing that helps is detecting the ""early symptoms"" that I'm going south and isolating myself until the worst has passed. For me, a clear symptom that I'm not fine is when I'm talking to someone expecting that person to say something specific that makes me feel better, that makes things alright. Whether the other person gets it right or not, I usually find myself getting angrier and angrier during such conversations. It's difficult to control oneself when you're in the middle of an emotional outburst, but it's not so when you catch yourself in the early stages of it. But we narcissists tend to ignore our emotions until they're so strong that we cannot keep them under control anymore. It can feel like they flipped a switch and you suddenly turned into Mr Hyde. But if you monitor yourself constantly and know what to look for, it's easy to see the transition.
