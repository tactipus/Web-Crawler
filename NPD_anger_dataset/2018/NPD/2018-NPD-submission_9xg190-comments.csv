e9sddch,t3_9xg190,I’d be interested to see what else you’ve got. It’s very valuable to be able to recognize the excuses we’re prone to. ,t3_9xg190
e9sspne,t3_9xg190,"Agreed.

 excuses justifications and reasons for why. They all make us feel not at fault and take off responsibility. Its a struggle.",t3_9xg190
ea5j7tp,t3_9xg190,"This post is great FuzzyZeus. I'm curious about what else you have in store. Have you thought about starting a blog or something?

I'm trying to think about excuses I've made but I think most of them fit in the categories you've already mentioned ( ""I'm not like this"", ""I don't know what got to me"", ""Well you did this other unrelated thing that upset me so now we're even"", etc ).

Maybe I could add the pre-emptive excuse, that consists in telling people that you're no good in advance and then telling them ""See, I told you"" when you mess up as if they deserved what happened for staying with you after you warned them. It doubles as a pity-plot because when you ""warn"" you're usually in the first stages of the relationship and still showing your best face, so people instinctively react by trying to assure you that you're great; and the ""told you"" part usually goes with some self-punitive stuff like ""I'm a piece of shit"" / ""I can't change"" which prompts people to console you.

I used the ""not the real me"" excuse even before suspecting I could have a mental illness. I think that, trying to ignore responsibility aside, many narcissists feel like they have split personality or something because when they're grandiose they cannot fathom how they think and feel when they're vulnerable and vice versa, and the change can happen in an instant. But it's actually just low self-awareness. Because you're blind to the emotions that are driving you from one state to the other, it may look like you actually have two different personalities.",t3_9xg190
