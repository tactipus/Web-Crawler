eby3a19,t3_a6uj1e,One of the top comments in this subreddit talks about the metaphor for NPD as fuel in a car. Great way to think about it. NPD is basically a self esteem regulation problem.,t3_a6uj1e
ebyglds,t3_a6uj1e,Yeah i feel like this all the time.  It's next-level exhausting.  That's why i have horrible anxiety.  I never know who to be.  It makes it difficult to care about life when you dont have a self.  How can you enjoy your own company if you dont exist?,t3_a6uj1e
ec0pb2o,t3_a6uj1e,"Oh god this hit me where I live.

I've managed to surround myself mostly with people who are supportive and care about me as a person at this point, but every single time my boss treats me like I'm an idiot at work (genuinely not my fault, several of my coworkers have complained about how the training is insufficient and that they feel mistreated by her) I'm immediately upset and it follows me the whole day. And if I feel like my boyfriend's opinion of me wavers at all, even from the slightest sounding lack of interest, I'm in tears.

It fucking sucks.",t3_a6uj1e
ebypple,t3_a6uj1e,"My mom has NPD, but your post describes me.",t3_a6uj1e
ebz3nrk,t3_a6uj1e,What I also find interesting is that I vacillate between thinking I am the GOAT and feeling that  everyone else is better than me and has a better life. I look at my own experiences sometimes and feel like it was all meaningless. I think because I wasn’t really living my life by taking it all in and experiencing it like normal people do. I was just going through the motions with a mask on.,t3_a6uj1e
eby7s5b,t1_eby3a19,Can you post a link to that ,t3_a6uj1e
ebz3vtz,t1_ebyglds,"Yes, I would (and still do to some degree) envy people who had terrible lives but at least where “real” and knew who they were. Even when I had more than most people financially and otherwise (and I still do), I am miserable because my “self” is defined and at the mercy of everyone else’s life and opinion of me.",t3_a6uj1e
ec0uewj,t1_ec0pb2o,"If we can get to the root of where it started, perhaps it will help",t3_a6uj1e
ebywc3l,t1_ebypple,"You probably have a milder form or picked up narcissistic traits.

ebzwowj,t1_eby7s5b,"Ah, it was actually from /r/narcissism. https://www.reddit.com/r/narcissism/comments/7teudd/explaining_narcissism_npd_in_a_way_that_makes_you/?utm_source=reddit-android",t3_a6uj1e
ebzws5k,t1_ebzwowj,"The metaphor they provide is very useful for understanding what happens within me when I get narcissistic thoughts or emotions. I'm running low on fuel, so I find ways to increase it. When I detect that I'm running low, by being mindful, I can improve my self esteem in healthier ways.",t3_a6uj1e
