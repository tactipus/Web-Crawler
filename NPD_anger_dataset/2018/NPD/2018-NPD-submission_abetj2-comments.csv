eczs70a,t3_abetj2,">This morning, New Year’s Eve, which is also our wedding anniversary, he violently wakes everyone up, very agitated and loud, and demands we are awake to get on schedule. I am peeved at that and that we had plans to stay up late with company and their babies anyway, and so I tell him to cancel all plans since he wants everybody going to bed early. A conversation probably could have changed my mind but he doesn’t do this. He cancels, our friends message me asking what’s wrong and I let them know, and I sulk the rest of the day waiting for an apology/sensitivity. He had bought me a plant and shoved it in my arms saying happy anniversary and I muttered a thank you. Am I being attention-seeking? Am a being a dictator? A cold bitch? 

What kind of upside down reality are you living in that you believe *you* were the one in the wrong here? Why do you feel bad/responsible after your partner *treated you* that way?",t3_abetj2
ed0cdtb,t3_abetj2,"NPD is a complex disorder. Only a professional could diagnose you, however here are a few questions that could help identify if you are, or not, a narcissist. Those questions challenge your overall behavior and the way you deal with life, not this specific event. No one knows enough of the context and the persons to be able to diagnose you from only one event ;)

(note : these questions come from a comment I posted on another, older post, but would fit here as well)

Do you feel entitled to being well treated, better than others, and feel easily as of people disrespect you? Are you secretly convinced than people work against you because they're jealous of you?

Do you have a facade that you put on to show the world how awesome you are but feel a never-ending void behind that facade that you try to ignore at all cost? Is your self-esteem super high but fragile (as in, a tiny thing can trigger immense rage and a need to defend yourself), or secretly very low and you work super hard to pretend you're actually awesome?

Did you grow up in a messed up family, were you pushed to he the greatest, or were you the Golden Child, always praised and enabled no matter what you did?

How is your memory? Do people often tell you you've said or done something that would make you look bad, but you genuinely don't remember doing/saying that?

Regarding issues in your relationships, whether friendship, romantic interests or anything else, do you feel like others have more efforts to do than you? Do you usually feel like a victim and that your worth is never validated enough?

Narcissism can be portrayed very differently from one person to another (it's more like a spectrum really), and I'm not a professional therapist. But with those questions you could have a better idea of whether you fit in the NPD mindset or not :)",t3_abetj2
ed0mhvf,t3_abetj2,"I'm a therapist. No one should diagnose ANYONE over the internet with 1 example, or 2 examples, or 100 examples. You need a  mental health professional to meet with you, provide an integrative assessment, and then they will make a determination. Anything you get here will not be accurate. Go to the doctor.

One example (or 2, etc) does not make a personality disorder. It needs to be a pervasive issue. Anyone diagnosing you here with a PD doesn't know what they're talking about.",t3_abetj2
ed1ztji,t1_ed0mhvf,Thank you. There's a lot of people that really need professional help. Wish mental health services were more readily available though.,t3_abetj2
ed2qhu0,t1_ed1ztji,"I totally agree with you :( Things don’t seem to be looking up. Recently, Medicaid decided to stop paying for no-shows, which happens A LOT with low income clients. It makes clinicians less willing to work with Medicaid since a no show = a wasted hour while other insurance/self pay will compensate. I’m hoping it gets better as mental health becomes less stigmatized, but I’m unsure. ",t3_abetj2
ed2rqqe,t1_ed2qhu0,"Shit that sucks. I do social services so I do know how often they no show, but I didn't know about the new lack of reimbursement. ",t3_abetj2
ed2tmir,t1_ed2rqqe,Unsure exactly how far reaching it is... but it's federal so probably nation-wide? ,t3_abetj2
