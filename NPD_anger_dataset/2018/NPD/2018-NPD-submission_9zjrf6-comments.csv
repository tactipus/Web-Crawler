eaa0zds,t3_9zjrf6,"My ex, who was formally diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder with narcissistic traits, was very aware that he was manipulative, but did not realize to what extent until after the diagnosis. He then started to notice that immediately upon meeting someone new, he would start taking mental notes of their weaknesses and insecurities to use against them in the future if he needed to. He referred to his ability to see others' weaknesses so quickly as his ""superpower"". So for the most part, he knew. 

That being said, there were many times he remembered things incorrectly and thus lied unknowingly. This is something everyone does from time to time, but it was a very common occurrence with him as it is part of the disorder (an extension of the maladaptive coping mechanism). He would often think of the worst case or best case scenario prior to a particular situation and even if thr event did not play out that way, the memory of the ""what if"" encoded in his brain as the true memory opposed to the reality of what had occurred.

eab4lpp,t3_9zjrf6,"My NPD ex knew deep down he was lying. He would do everything he could to convince me and himself that his version of reality was true, but eventually he would admit that he wasn't being honest. He never admitted that he wasn't being honest, it was more like he would admit that what I said was true, not that what he said was a lie. But he would always repeat the lie to other people anyway as his version of the truth. So yeah, you know. You are trying to manipulate someone into believing your lie so that you can feel better and eventually believe that it's true. ",t3_9zjrf6
eal61pb,t3_9zjrf6,"I'm gonna go against the majority in this and say, I wasn't aware of my manipulations before becoming self-aware. I actually score super low on the machiavellianism personality trait so that may have to do with it.

If we're talking about straight up lies, I was usually aware that I was lying. Maybe not in the moment I lied (maybe a lie was necessary to avoid an uncomfortable situation or make me look good and I would say it without thought) but shortly after I would be like ""wtf am I saying"". I would often keep the lie up though, until it was unsustainable, because I couldn't admit that I was a liar.

But for any subtler types of manipulation such as gaslighting and stuff, I would fully rationalize and believe everything I did. For example, I would be fully convinced that I was saying something just because it was the best for the other person and not because it was for my convenience. Or legitimately think that someone was crazy, ignorant or whatever because they disagreed with me on something.

I have only this one memory from when I was young of myself laying in bed thinking about how to frame a situation so I wasn't the bad guy and catching myself on it, and just, ignoring it and going on. Only once as far as I remember.

I've become so much better at discerning and accepting my true intentions though.",t3_9zjrf6
eaeq1hv,t3_9zjrf6,"You would realize that you’re tricking people, and then continue. It feels like you’re catching yourself doing yourself a future solid. Other times it’s part of your skill set and you see an opportunity. You just see it and you do it, it’s really not a matter of should I or should I not based on awareness. If you really are this type of person, you are going to do it.",t3_9zjrf6
eakgv3b,t3_9zjrf6,"Of course you know. But as someone else pointed out, you just don't care. The truth is almost... beside the point. There are many more important considerations in a situation. The ""truth"" just does not matter to us the way it does other people. Not saying I condone this but this is how it feels. ",t3_9zjrf6
ea9qhk0,t3_9zjrf6,"Most people with npd aren’t aware that there behavior is manipulative. They usually believe they are the victim of situations, I might not be correct though as I don’t have npd. But from what i’ve read that’s usually what they say. ",t3_9zjrf6
eaa0wzp,t3_9zjrf6,"Since people with NPD have separate public vs private masks, I’m going to assume they know exactly what they’re doing. ",t3_9zjrf6
eab8vvd,t3_9zjrf6,"All my lies are 100% intentional and have a purpose.

Mythomania is a compulsive disorder, not intrinsic to narcissism, you can be a mythomaniac without narc traits and vice versa.

Also, even the worst mythomaniacs have some degree of awareness of their lies, they just can't control it like a narc does.",t3_9zjrf6
easc4h0,t3_9zjrf6,"I said many lies and I was confident that what I said was the truth. Very often people made me notice the incongruity of what I was saying, of my behaviors. This drove me crazy, causing my rage, at the end causing the failure of my life (working with others was simply not possible).

Recently I realized I am conscious of every single lie, but my self awareness about it (""I said it, but it's not the truth"") disappear as soon I speak about it. It is like earing my own words makes them the truth. I admitted (to myself, but also to other people) that I was conscious of every single lie, but not of the whole amount of lies.

This way I realized that many of my beliefes about myself was ... just lies I told to myself. Giving up is not easy, to me, but I feel it is necessary to overcome my disturb.

Narcs are always felt as people that say lies to others. First of all we say lies to ourself. This is the only way we can act the (very bad) way we do.",t3_9zjrf6
eciqimc,t3_9zjrf6,"When my NPD ex finally told me the full extent of the truth, I was shocked. What sticks out most is that he said he was completely aware he was lying, but it was like a subconscious compulsion, it just sort of fell out of his mouth and he'd roll with it. Especially when drinking heavily. But even when drinking, everything from being a veteran to an 10k escort to his lesbian rich affluent white mums to knowing Billie Eillish, he knew to be a lie 100%",t3_9zjrf6

eamr4uq,t1_eal61pb,I can relate to this.,t3_9zjrf6
eaap5b5,t1_ea9qhk0,"It’s really just self justification beginning from early age. I don’t believe that my lies really deserve to get found out, nothing will ever really change that mentality. My brain just makes excuses and I don’t feel bad about believing them for a quick moment in need. I don’t even think about it really, lies just happen. When I don’t have an answer that won’t incriminate me, I throw out a little lie that makes me innocent. Simple as that.",t3_9zjrf6
eab4qis,t1_ea9qhk0,"> Most people with npd aren’t aware that there behavior is manipulative.

I completely disagree. My Narc-ex actually told me that when he was talking to another person he was constantly trying to figure out how to work them. He knew, he just thought that was normal. It wasn't until he was about 35 that he realized most people don't do that.",t3_9zjrf6
