Fun = being the best in one way or another; whether it's true or I can convince myself of it.

Generally, the things I find enjoyment in are those that make me look good or train me to make the best impression.

Even something as minute as video games! I rarely play, and then I can only bring myself to play games that I think will train some cognitive function. 

I almost never drink alcohol, because it hampers my performance. And anyway, I'm so used to monitoring and controlling myself that alcohol doesn't even really make me loosen up unless I get so drunk I'm about to black out. 

This sort of thing is why I agree with the idea that Stoic philosophy is a good path for us NPD folks to take. If fun is something to be indifferent to, you can instead focus on being virtuous. While that can obviously also become a source of pride, at least it serves the world well and gives a deeper satisfaction.",t3_a3xtjh
