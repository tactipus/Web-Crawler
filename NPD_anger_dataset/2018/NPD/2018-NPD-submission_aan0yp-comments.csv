ectes6w,t3_aan0yp,"If you were close friends it's likely she idolised you, at least in some way, and you did something to change her perception of you. People with NPD tend to think in very black and white terms, called splitting. Others tend to be ""good"" or ""bad"". Once you flip from good to bad it's almost impossible to reverse the change. In my case it was like a switch flipped in my head and I no longer saw the individual as a ""person"" so I no longer had to care about them in any way. It's a self protection mechanism gone awry. ",t3_aan0yp
ecv2l0w,t3_aan0yp,"I'm gonna try and break this down into what probably happened, in the loosest possible terms with a few possibilities for a couple:

1. She looked up to you / saw value in you / saw you as an exploitable resource
2. You were acquired for that purpose, friendship established. Supply was extracted.
3. You did something to invalidate the above. You are no longer whatever #1 was.
4. She removed you from the rotation of supply.
5. Now she has a problem; there is evidence of, and experiences of, a relationship that was wrong. A wrong decision. A narcissist does not make wrong decisions. Therefore this decision didn't happen.
6. Evidence is removed as it's found and discarded. History is rewritten. If people bring you up, they will be corrected, and if they won't be corrected, they too will be #3'd.
7. The process continues until nonfunctional supply is cleared from the pool. She will find others to replace all affected.

It's really not that complicated. People in deep to the Narc kool aid really do believe themselves infallible, and they'll twist and torture reality until it fits that conclusion. The first step a Narc getting self aware is recognizing that we make mistakes, and that it's okay. It's a foundational thing that changes how you think, but in terms of narcissistic injury, it's practically suicide (not literally of course, it's melodramatics stemming from insecurity, it just FEELS like that in the moment.) Without that start, no progress can be made. I'd challenge anyone to explain how it's possible otherwise.

And honestly? You should feel bad for her, she's not well, but only insofar as it's not your problem to solve. Her emotions are not your responsibility, especially so now that you've been discarded. It's not your circus, and not your monkeys. Find better people to hang with who don't review your performance and ""fire"" you if you fail to meet their unreasonable expectations.",t3_aan0yp
edmg4rc,t3_aan0yp,"it can be nsuppy to block and remove someone so they know they are better then you

or it could be that they feared youd abandon them so they abandoned you first.

eczxpsi,t1_ecv2l0w,"This is really good and helps me understand what happened in my last relationship, thank you.  I've done 1-4 in my less self-aware days from BPD, but not 5-6, at least not since I was 16 or so.  NPD is so Orwellian.",t3_aan0yp

ecuxzsl,t1_ectzd58,"Why do you think she feels guilty? 


People with NPD tend to have one favourite person at a time, once they pick a new one they generally won't think about previous ones. I've found that it's not that I don't care about the person any more, more that I can only put my energy into one person at a time and I'll concentrate on who I think is most important to my life at the time. I may reach out to other people from time to time but it's usually only when they can do something for me. We make terrible friends. ",t3_aan0yp
ed3ofis,t1_ed3k8kn,">I don't think she sees herself as infallible though, she feels too insecure to believe that.

You're conflating the perception of the self and the confidence in that perception. Most narcissists believe they are infallible, while regarding themselves incredibly lowly. It's one of the distinguishing characteristics. 

And you're welcome, glad I could help.",t3_aan0yp
