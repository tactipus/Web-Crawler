ec0ur4t,t3_a76z8n,Congrats. Enjoy. I look with envy at my friend in just such a relationship. They are both writers. Anyone else would think the parameters of their relationship are odd and disrespectful. They are perfectly happy. ,t3_a76z8n

ec0uswf,t1_ec0ti51,"I actually have both, personally. I'm not as visibly narcissistic because I want people to like me and I'm not an idiot about it. I used to be a lot worse.

ec17hdy,t1_ec0uswf,Kind of. Just the way you speak.,t3_a76z8n
