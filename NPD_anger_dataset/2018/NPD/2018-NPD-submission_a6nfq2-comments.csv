ebwrr7g,t3_a6nfq2,"I am only now really seeking treatment related to the problems my narcissism causes me but I have been in therapy, on and off, for years. I wasn't aware I suffered from NPD until I was well on the way to having it under control but I was aware that I was depressed as hell and had fucked up thinking patterns so I sought help for that.  I've never been officially diagnosed but my mother is a poster child for NPD and I'm self aware enough now to look back and see a lot of those behaviours in myself. 

I'm much better now, so please believe it can be done, but it didn't happen overnight. You only really notice when you look back, and think about how something would have effected you in the past, and realise how much better you cope now.  There will always be things in life which are difficult but those things get slowly further apart and takes less time to get over each time. It's like the proverb says, ""How do you eat an elephant?...One bite at a time."" ",t3_a6nfq2
ec3z0h4,t3_a6nfq2,"Iâ€™ve been to multiple therapists. Tried a few different medications for a time as well. It all helps for a while but then I sink back to who I am, which is a person without a soul; a facade, a walking puzzle made up of pieces I put together myself to try to have a personality, but that never completely fit, and that never completely work correctly in life.",t3_a6nfq2

ebxbnt0,t1_ebx8fva,"They teach you how to challenge your destructive thought patterns and take control of your inner monologue. This ultimately leads to changes in your emotional states and therefore your behaviour. 


I remember wanting to learn empathy but it seemed to develop as a byproduct of the other changes I was making. I guess if you go into therapy wanting to be more empathetic then that's what you'll get out of it. That seems to be the way with therapy, you get out what you put in. 


Thank you, I hope you find the help you need.
