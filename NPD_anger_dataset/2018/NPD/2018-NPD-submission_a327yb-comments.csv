eb3c97p,t3_a327yb,"I would (and did) start with setting up an appointment with a therapist. There's NO shame in it and you don't even have to tell anyone if you don't want to. Though, telling someone close to you would be a really humbling experience and a huge step in the right direction. If that therapist doesn't work out, find a new one. You need someone who can help you find the true you and pursue that true sense of self every minute of every day.",t3_a327yb

I did the exact thing today. I found myself lying A Lot when it comes to work and university. I promised myself that I would be more honest to my college and peers.  


I do not want to be fake anymore. I wanna have a real connection to those around me.",t3_a327yb
ej8y7ov,t3_a327yb,"I have had this EXACT same problem, and it was and continues to be really difficult for me to open up with my therapist. But what has helped me a immensely with this is: write down in my phone, clearly and succinctly what my problems are, in the exact words I want to say them to my therapist, and then promise myself I will read them out to her.

Doing this was a big help for me, and writing down my issues helps me to process things just by myself. It gives me the opportunity to use clear language so I don't have to worry about misunderstandings with my therapist. For me my biggest issue was constant grandiose fantasies. Over time I was able to open up more and more, and needed this writing things down technique less and less.

What has worked the most for self improvement for me has been: being utterly and brutally honest with my therapist.

I am no professional but that fact that you have a lot of shame and fear the judgement of your therapist is probably a good omen for your eventual recovery. Good luck mate :)",t3_a327yb

eb3gkco,t1_eb3f9t4,"There is no “maybe” buckle down and commit (right Yoda?). You HAVE to buckle down and commit. I don’t know your situation but if it’s at all similar to mine you’ll be happiest when you’re known fully by someone. Admit what’s wrong and you’ll realize “oh, no one’s opinion actually fucking matters”. It’s hard, grueling work but so worth it. The path to freedom for the narcissist, and anyone really, is honesty. I’m pulling for you.",t3_a327yb
eb4vy99,t1_eb3gkco,"Just to add to this, if you take the leap and really open up it will help you get better sooner. Not only will you hurt other people less but you will be happier in yourself as well. You have a lot to gain from taking a really hard look at yourself and remember, you weren't born this way, you were made this way. You coped by developing behavioural patterns that worked at the time but are unhelpful now. It's not your fault for being this way but you are responsible if you recognise it and do nothing about it.  Well done for starting on the road to recovery! ",t3_a327yb
