I understand that it's a self-selecting group of victims of narcissistic abuse and naturally trends towards the worse end of the spectrum of our disorder, however the victims for either the reasons put forward here or for their own reasons regularly refer to narcissists as monsters, consciously and intentionally preying on victims. While we are definitely abusers when we don't know what we're doing, I feel it's overly unkind and not productive to put us in groups with racists and rapists. Understandable, yes, given the source. But not helpful.

I empathize with those who want to ""save"" their given Narcissist, be it a boyfriend, a parent, etc. It's a miserable fucking condition that I wouldn't wish on anyone, and it's often bluntly obvious to those not in the fog that a narcissist is fucking miserable more often than not, and it's their own damn fault more often than not. But it's easy to forget that the narcissist's first victim was themselves. We can't have normal relationships. We can't feel the right things and we know it's wrong, but how on Earth can you solve a problem that you don't know you have?

I can't put into words the most insidious part of this condition; that from the inside, our twisted and tortured worldview made ***perfect fucking sense to me***, and I'd like to say I'm a pretty sharp individual and even before I was self-aware, ***I thought I was self aware***. I thought this was how the world worked. I thought everyone else were narcissists too and we were all playing the same game with the same pieces, issuing some tears here, a screaming match there, giving in and taking advantage when it suited us to do either and swapping ""points"" that we'd later cash in when we needed something from people. This was just how the world worked. If I talked to me from 3 years ago right now about this shit, I'd likely have called my future self certifiably insane.

And again I don't begrudge the victims from feeling the way they do. I'm just saying that if you are genuinely looking to help a Narcissist in your life, simply shouting at them about how monstrous they are over and over isn't going to do shit. We know we're monsters, and you are too, and we don't understand why you're throwing a fit about the rules to a game we were born into (or more often, just think you're angry because you keep losing said game).",t3_a3e9s7
eciq6lr,t3_a3e9s7,"Ok you can argue that not all do, but some absolutely do exactly that. To what extent I don't know. But it so accurately described my ex who was the love of my life that it gave me chills, cold and calculated.",t3_a3e9s7
ecwzwc8,t3_a3e9s7,"Agree with this completely. I've also noticed this attempt to demonize narcissists any time the topic is brought up. A narcissist is not a sadist. The pleasure I get from my ""supply"" isn't because of the pain, but because they let me hurt them. The power I feel over them is intoxicating. The power they let me have. I'm essentially a hurt little child who plays games with people to feel strong. Nothing big, scary or monstrous. And I doubt refusing to see things as they are will help anyone in the long run.",t3_a3e9s7
eb7ps63,t1_eb5fxmy,"Pop psychology self diagnosing any asshole ex as a ""narcissist/sociopath"" based on vague examplesWell, when inverted/covert narcissists who are obsessed with being the underdog to the classic narcissists they are codependent with are part of that population, it is rather hard to even know who/what you are dealing with.

Also, the situation with the borderline personality disorder factor makes it harder to really know who/what to believe.  One thing I see ironically is this hyper-reactive defensiveness when it comes to their overlapping behavior with NPD, sociopathy and/or bipolar disorder.  They are hypocritical.

They are everywhere but the self centered component is where the denial with that issue makes it hard.  Because there's the ""we're all exceptions to the rule"" theme is how the deflection happens.  They are unable to see the other end of that without threatening suicide etc.  ",t3_a3e9s7
