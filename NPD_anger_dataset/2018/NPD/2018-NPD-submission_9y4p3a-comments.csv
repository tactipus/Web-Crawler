ea3xkc6,t3_9y4p3a,"I just want to be loved, respected and admired. I want lots of friends (but don’t want to put the work in to maintain them), lots of beautiful women who want to have sex with me, be successful in business or other things, etc. I feel like I can’t be truly happy without these things. Like it’s my right and destiny to have them; I “should” have them. I have virtually none of these things but I still feel like one day maybe I will and I’m in my 50’s.",t3_9y4p3a
e9zuw3f,t3_9y4p3a,"Disclaimer: I'm Narcissistic and Bipolar so maybe it effects my answer. 
I usually live in a delusional narcissistic bubble where I feel immune to criticism and don't really require validation from others. Sometimes serious criticism can get through and pop the bubble, and that can cause serious depression and take me down a few pegs, but deep down I always still feel superior. It's toxic and pathological but it's how I'm wired.. like some kind of broken compensatory defense mechanism. It would be better to live in reality.",t3_9y4p3a
e9y6skq,t3_9y4p3a,I'm also extremely sensitive to criticism and avoid vulnerability.  Not sure if that helps provide a more complete picture,t3_9y4p3a
ea5k9n6,t3_9y4p3a,">If you have any easy ways to gain supply that (preferably) don't hurt others I'd love it if you shared.

Well, it'd be better if you worked on not needing as much validation to function, maybe with a therapist. But on the meanwhile, people usually give you attention if you help them and are nice to them. Or if you are genuinely and objectively very good at something that most people aren't. You can start a blog or a social media profile to share your talent / mastery of some area of knowledge with others.

I'm currently trying to do those things, trying to appreciate very much the good feedback and trying to ignore the bad (like, if someone is not appreciative enough for my kindness or my mastery I try to not rage or sulk).

Pity-plots usually don't hurt anyone and don't require effort and sometimes you can get attention from them, but most people find them manipulative and irritating. ",t3_9y4p3a
ea5kb7d,t1_ea3xkc6,"I'm in my 30s and I am constantly punishing myself for having this kind of ""childish, unrealistic dreams"". I'm always relying on a better future and I feel that if when I'm on my deathbed I haven't achieved them I'll be really miserable. And at the same time I know those are just fantasies that will never be real and even if they were they would probably not make me happy in the long run. Whenever I've got something I've wanted the happiness only lasted a little bit. I really don't know what to do about that.",t3_9y4p3a
ea1ojcg,t1_e9zuw3f,"I would agree. At times my ego seems so disordered as to almost feel ""impenetrable"". I more \*recognize\* criticisms than actually \*feel\* them. This isn't great because my perception is very skewed and deviated from reality: ie I feel like the shit whether I got an F or an A on that test. Sometimes this can be helpful but other times it has lead to self indulgence/destruction ",t3_9y4p3a
eannpxc,t1_e9y6skq,"Which kind of criticism? Are you equally sensitive to big and small mistakes/errors?

In the past I noticed that: I was not able to distiguish my small errors from the big ones: any kind of error (noticed by other people) made me unhappy at the same (quiet high) degree.
When I realized that, it was also obvious to me I was disturbed.",t3_9y4p3a
