ecxiuze,t3_ab3vnw,"Yeah this speaks to me. I usually take one of two paths. 

1) I am very direct and make it known that what they did was disrespectful. Just state it matter of factly. No anger or aggression. Don't be accusatory. Just say it. Half the time they apologize. Half the time they get defensive so I default to option 2.

2) Sometimes I just start with this one when I know direct isn't they way to go. Basically, I clam up and remove myself from the conversation or room altogether. Then I go sit and think and get very mad, sometimes emotional. I process the situation fully. Was it intentional? Was it meaningful? Did it affect my wellbeing or status? Does that person even matter? Usually I will come to a stable place in due time. If possible, I even discuss it with the person once I've calmed down. This is hard to do at first, but practice helps. 

I'm no psychology professor and this may not be the best advice, but it's kept my relationship with my wife incredibly strong over the years and even endeared me to coworkers because they respect the honesty and willingness to confront issues. Hope this help. ",t3_ab3vnw

ed1zu6s,t3_ab3vnw,You are not a pussy boy. You are maturing. Over time you will find that people actually do get what they earn.,t3_ab3vnw
ecxmeor,t3_ab3vnw,Why are you hanging out with people who treat you like that? ,t3_ab3vnw
ed1woaj,t3_ab3vnw,"I suffer deeply from this behavior as well and am always vigilant about it. (Disclaimer- I actually have a mixed PD that is essentially co-morbid NPD and PPD with some antisocial features, so I may be a little different.)
I used to walk away, nurse the wound, then play the victim and turn the tables on the rude person. Step by Step, I got everyone else to hate them and blew it all out of proportion until the perpetrator's life was hell because they'd lost credibility.  If it was a coworker, I usually didn't stop until I got them fired.  
Now, I'm more direct.  If it's a man, I fire a verbal warning shot across the bow mixed with some sexual undertones.  But if it's another woman, God help her.  I skip the warning shot and dress her down.  You've got to nip disrespect in the bud.  Embrace cool, articulate verbal confrontation.  Because if you don't, it will fester and you will loathe yourself for your weakness.  I'm a female bartender-- its occupationally unwise for me to appear weak.  But I think anyone can take a page out of my book. Good luck to you ",t3_ab3vnw
ed1xgvk,t1_ecxgfih,"Same here.  Try staying cool when you confront though.  If they raise their voice, lower yours.  Content and tone, my friend, not volume.  I feel you.",t3_ab3vnw
ed93yuq,t1_ed1zu6s,"Even if they don't, you're better off letting go. Learning to manage your emotions and identifying why said behavior triggers you so heavily might help dealing with the situation. But I know the feeling",t3_ab3vnw
ecy59d7,t1_ecxmeor,"That’s the real question

Why?

Idk, I don’t really have anyone else",t3_ab3vnw
ed2vuim,t1_ed1woaj,May I ask why the behavior response differs when you're dealing with a male vs a female person? Just curious ,t3_ab3vnw
ed1xqn6,t1_ed1woaj,"Hmm... I don't know if necessarily agree with that, but i'll bite.

Care to provide a few examples?

For instance: ""Faeriefluffox, shut up, you don't know shit:
or ""Faeriefluffox, you're an idiot""
or shit like that

Just general disresepct",t3_ab3vnw
edickhf,t1_ed2vuim,May I ask who exactly is asking?  Not buying 'just curious'.   That was a very specific question.  I need to know my audience so I can modify my response. ,t3_ab3vnw
edibq1l,t1_ed1xqn6,"I'd classify those examples as one-liners, not general disrespect.  A one-liner gets sustained eye contact and a cold reply, usually with a laugh.  ""Who on earth do you think you are that you can speak to me that way? I'm afraid you've mistaken me for someone else.  Walk away now and reflect on this."" That speech, or a variation upon it, is my standard. It hasn't failed me yet.  I taught English for over a decade before changing careers, so I usually find myself shifting back into ""classroom managment"" demeanor for this.  99.9% of the time, they get embarrassed and do what I say.  Shocks the hell out of me, since I'm a petite woman.  That's why I told you that tone and concise content are everything. 
Take the advice if it works, leave it here if it doesn't. ",t3_ab3vnw
edk688j,t1_edickhf,"Well... I don't know how to answer that, that is a broad question. I am 26 f myself and I ask because my own responses differ in that way also and I am trying to see if your answer will give me insight into my own behaviors (or the root thereof). ",t3_ab3vnw
edidt2j,t1_edibq1l,"I honestly think this is the best answer here, thank you for that, and I will definitely implement it into my life.

One more follow up question: 
What do you do when people challenged it?",t3_ab3vnw
edkscln,t1_edk688j,"Sure you know how to answer-- you just answered my question very well.
The question you ask is a complex one and it has many answers.  I have grappled with it for a long time.  I can give you a clinical answer, a Jungian answer, a practical answer based on my own life experience, an answer from my own academic field of study. . . or all of them.  Message me if u want. ",t3_ab3vnw
edihrwu,t1_edidt2j,"Ah, that leads us into the territory I'd call ""advanced warfare"".  Send me a private message and I will be happy to help.
For now, I will make this general observation: If you were born with dark triad traits the way I was, you already have the ability to defend yourself in your arsenal.  The component chemicals are there, you just need to have them ready to synthesize into weapons against that tiny minority who are both hostile and aggressive enough to ignore a clear verbal boundary.  It isn't pleasant, but let's be real: If you have gotten to this point with an individual, they're spoiling for a fight anyway.  
There's a great YouTube clip of Robert Downey, Jr. shutting down a rude and intrusive journalist that might help you.  I'll see if I can't chase down the link. ",t3_ab3vnw
