ecgeuo4,t3_a915p6,"I mean, everyone has a limited number of fucks to give on any given day. When you aren't feeling well yourself, you have even fewer fucks than usual. 

Honestly you don't sound narcissistic or frankly even selfish. You can't bail someone out forever, just like you say. If the guy realized you weren't going to help him was enough to push him over the edge, IMO, he wasn't long for this life anyway.

Doesn't make it suck less, of course. It's disgusting how we treat veterans in this country, but it doesn't mean it's your fault for not helping him every single time.

Sorry for your loss. And agree with u/Lamzn6, grief counseling would be a good idea for you.",t3_a915p6
ecfz2fs,t3_a915p6,"If you don’t know this already, this is something you really need to talk to a professional about. Even if you weren’t narcissistic this is one of those life events you’ve probably got to talk out with someone. 

I’m sorry for your loss. ",t3_a915p6
ecgb32f,t3_a915p6,"Please don't accuse yourself. He had a son, as it turns out from your last paragraph, he should have been the first one helping him. A stranger (ok, you became friendly, but still) thinking about offering him to sleep at his place, giving him money, while the son doesn't?  Wtf?

Totally not your fault man ♥ ",t3_a915p6
ech1my6,t3_a915p6,"This is what went through my mind while reading your post:

* You may have saved that man's life in the past several times with your acts of kindness, and you just don't know.
* It is very reasonable to take care of one's needs before anyone else's. That's not being selfish, or in better words, it's healthy selfishness. Trying to take care of a person in a vulnerable position when you're not yourself in a good place can go terribly wrong. That's why people's support network cannot consist of just one person.
* You were probably not the only person in your friend's support network. So your guilt is, at the very least, shared among all his relatives and friends, if it can be said that you're guilty at all.
* You just couldn't know that it would end like this. You can't be responsible for what you don't know.

Regret is an emotion of growth. It pushes us to try to undo our wrongdoings and be more careful of our choices in the future. I don't think you're responsible for this tragedy at all, but maybe you can still learn something from it. Maybe it can motivate you to be even more attuned to other people's needs in the future.

I'm sorry for your loss.",t3_a915p6
ecgfez3,t1_ecgeuo4,"Thank you. I know you are probably right. It’s just the thought that there was a guy who needed help “right in front of me”, and in a sense I turned him away by ignoring him for a time. We always think their will be more time to “do the right thing”, but sometimes there isn’t and by the time we find out, it’s too late.

Again, thank you for your support. This Reddit group had been an incredibly helpful resource with all of you great people who contribute. 

And I am looking for a therapist.",t3_a915p6
ecfzaj1,t1_ecfz2fs,Yea you are right. I have been talking to a lot of friends and family about it. But it’s not going to take away the guilt and regret. I do want to talk to a therapist. Thank you ,t3_a915p6
ecgf4mq,t1_ecgb32f,"Thank you for your support. His son may not have been in a position to help him and I know the two of them had a lot of conflicts so maybe they weren’t in touch at the time. I’ll find out more details soon most likely. But you are right, he did have some family. 

I suppose we almost always look back after someone dies and ask ourselves if we could have done something more or differently. 

Thank you again for your supportive words ",t3_a915p6
ech71ct,t1_ech1my6,"Thank you. That was well thought and said. 

I did meet with his son today and got the details. Turns out his son and daughter had been helping him and he was staying at his daughters until his daughters boyfriend kind of forced him out (I guess the boyfriend is a real jerk). He had been living in his car for about a week. He was waiting to pick up a friend at a gas station and he suffered some kind of coronary issue. He basically stopped breathing and lost consciousness and someone found him slumped over in his car and an ambulance took him to the hospital but they couldn’t fully revive him. As his son said, he had a poor diet, didn’t excercise and had smoked and dranked a lot most of his life, so it wasn’t surprising.

So at least he went fairly peacefully and was not completely alone in the world. His son is actually a great young man and he said his dad was always there for him and taught him a lot of good things and values in life. So, my friend was at the end a lucky man because he left a good legacy. ",t3_a915p6
ecgfo5j,t1_ecgfez3,">We always think their will be more time to “do the right thing”, but  sometimes there isn’t and by the time we find out, it’s too late.

You **did** do the right thing, for yourself, and there's nothing wrong with that. You can't live solely for other people, you've gotta look out for yourself too.

Hang in there buddy, and good luck on the search.",t3_a915p6
