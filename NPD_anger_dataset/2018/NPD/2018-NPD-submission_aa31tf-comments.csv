ecoop0s,t3_aa31tf,"Loving someone with BPD is hard, and if they are not working on getting better, it is NOT WORTH IT.  Living with this kind of insecurity about your daily life, what comes tomorrow, etc. will kill you eventually. If he's doing everything possible to recognize his triggers, modify his behavior- that's different. I don't think there are many people who can do that successfully, but some do.

BUT the $5K?  I can't believe you didn't tell him to go fuck himself!  That's not BPD talking, that's an asshole talking. That is someone who does not care about you talking. BPD might make him run away, but extorting you for love?  That's just an asshole.
I'm really hoping this is a troll. If it's real, girl, get yourself some therapy.  You can do better.",t3_aa31tf
econzzm,t3_aa31tf,"This could be BPD with NPD traits, my ex was very similar. All I can say is that it sounds like he's still very much in the toxic stage of his illness and honestly, the best thing you can do at this point it walk away. I know how hard it is and I didn't listen to my friends when they told me I should do the same but please, trust me.  He is only going to cause you more pain until you are forced to break up with him or he looses trust in you (which will not be for something you have *actually* done) and his feelings for you will change. This has probably already happened which is why he's trying to extort money out of you. My ex let me believe that he still cared because he was basically living in my house for free and he didn't want to move back in with his parents. 


Anyway, I'm still recovering from the consequences of that relationship. Do yourself a big favour and walk away now. ",t3_aa31tf

ecoxt0a,t3_aa31tf,"This isn't a symptom with any personality disorder or other mental illness, it's abuse. He may have BPD or NPD but neither of those or any other mental disorders are synonymous with abusive behaviour. ",t3_aa31tf
ecoul97,t3_aa31tf,"Honestly, why are you even considering getting back together? His behavior is ridiculous.

If you love him you will not let him get away with something like this, even if it means you can't be together. Enabling that kind of behavior doesn't make him any favors.

If you really really really want to give him a chance, try something along the lines of ""Look, I love you madly and if you want to get back together I would love to be with you, and I'm willing to prove my love to you in appropriate ways"" (reassurance since BPDs/NPDs are oversensitive). ""But you asking me for money has nothing to do with love. I feel like you're just trying to extort me and it's unacceptable"" (discipline and firm boundary). It's possible that his instant reaction is bad, but if he loves you he may ask you again in a more reasonable way when he calms down. If not, you dodged a bullet.",t3_aa31tf
ecopb2n,t3_aa31tf,"Ma'am... You need to stay away from this person, who is not only using/abusing you (abuse is mis-use and using someone for their money is mis-use of the benefits of a relationship), but they are also a coward. Here is someone who can only even behave this way over text, not in person.

All of that being said, I am willing to bet the root of it is a 3rd scenario you haven't thought of. He needs money for \*something\* (drugs? bad debt? something he really wants? gambling?) and he knows you value your relationship more than money (as any sane, healthy partner would). He doesn't. He is leveraging your relationship to get what he wants. He is going to exploit this value call of yours (him > your money and self respect) as much as he can. He in NO way thinks you are really broken up. This is just a ploy to get what he wants.

The NPD part of this is him acting like he is doing you a favor by even ""giving you the opportunity to buy another chance with him"". That is a deeply disordered sentiment and this man needs therapy for that alone, all else aside.

Find someone else. The more you give in, the more he will know he can get out of you/get away with, and the more he will keep pushing your boundaries. You will wake up one day and not even recognize how far your limits have gone. Take it from people who have BEEN him. This person will hurt and use you precisely as long as you allow it, and to the extent to which you allow it.",t3_aa31tf
ecorf6a,t3_aa31tf,"Would you be okay with your best friend being treated this way? Or your favorite family member? It's hard when you truly care about someone, but it's not love when a person requires you to hurt yourself to *prove* your love.",t3_aa31tf
ecp355b,t3_aa31tf,"There's often comorbidity. But also, BPD can be just as dangerous as NPD.

The solution is simple. Keep putting boundaries in place and respecting yourself until he gives up and leaves you alone. That's the only way to get out of this situation with your self esteem in check.",t3_aa31tf

ecwqoh9,t3_aa31tf,"He obviously doesn't care about you. At all. It's a pity that you care so much about him. What you need to do is simple: block him on everything. Stay at a friend's house for a while if you think he might lash out. Don't give him the opportunity to reel you back in. Earlier on, you might miss him and try to get back with him. Don't let yourself forget that he truly doesn't care about you and he doesn't deserve your emotional investment. ",t3_aa31tf
ed982w9,t3_aa31tf,"Child of BPD mother and NPD father here. Identify with some hypersensitive narcissistic traits/dysthimia myself, and have been in codependent/abusive relationships/friendships/workplaces before. 

Recently realized I was definitely behaving like an NPD in my current 3y+ relationship and in my current codependent work environment. 

Speaking from all this experience, he doesn’t love you and never has. He doesn’t even show basic respect for you. 

This $5k thing is a test to see how much abuse you will put up with. 

You also need to realize that it is not your job to fix him. He is not your project. Judging from how you describe your experience with him, your emotional needs have probably been neglected severely in the past. You have probably already suffered from abuse. 

If so, you need to realize that you’re not anyone’s caretaker, and that the only one you need to fix is you. 

Take care.

ecpo7qv,t1_ecpim1q,"I absolutely recognise all the things he's doing, I've been pretty much where you are. 


The thing is, the guy you fell in love with doesn't actually exist, that was who he made himself because that's who you wanted him to be. Now he can't/won't keep it up. I'm afraid that person isn't coming back.  I understand your urge to help him but the only person who can help him is him. If he's not ready to change then no one can make him.  

Also please remember that just because he has bpd doesn't mean he gets a free pass to be an asshole.  My best friend has bpd and we generally get along great. Mental illness does not absolve you of taking responsibility for your behaviour. ",t3_aa31tf
ecqiudk,t1_ecqgk0a,"It's not. Yes, someone with narcissitic behaviours may be more likely to be abusive. BUT there are many people with NPD that do not abuse others. Abusive behaviour is not a symptom of NPD. ",t3_aa31tf
ecq0c16,t1_ecpg8a7,"He wanted you to pay him money to get him back. Put a boundary in that any relationship with you has nothing to do with money. If he freaks out that's hos problem. You can't babysit him forever.

You want him to freak out so that you can discard him.",t3_aa31tf
