ebd9bhl,t3_a4auo4,"Here's a list. I'm Narcissistic and aware of it, so some of these aren't current. I'm much more aware of my flaws these days. Anyway\~

Grandiose fantasies I've had are\~ feelings of superiority, feeling I'm special / unique, thinking I'm smarter than most people, thinking life is just going to keep getting better and better for me, thinking I'll feel good all the time in the future, feeling like I should feel more blissful than everyone else all the time, thinking I'm such an amazing person for being an entrepreneur / my achievements, thinking I can do no wrong, etc.

Honestly, I don't believe most of these anymore. I'm more grounded these days. I'm also Bipolar, not sure if that affects my list in a weird way.

OP what you're describing sounds like it could be delusional thinking depending on your exact symptoms (hard to say without more info).",t3_a4auo4
ebdbwul,t3_a4auo4,I'm not necessarily sure if I'm a narcissist. But  I feel that I am special and unique in a way with my intelligence and I can't accept/admit that there is someone who is more intelligent than I am.,t3_a4auo4
ec0pw7e,t3_a4auo4,"I have a few. Recurring ones are being famous/important enough, or attached to someone who is, to not have to do traditional desk work to support myself anymore; being able to defend people in danger, especially my friends from their abusers, painting me in a heroic light; and as a sort of unique martyr if I end up dying tragically.

It's all pretty stupid, objectively, but hey.",t3_a4auo4

ebvuwqc,t1_ebdqx2e,wait what? Those are all examples of grandiosity? Or grandiose fantasies? Crap. I over spend and over shop to look good. And I always think people only want me for what I have or could offer them.,t3_a4auo4
ebybu7k,t1_ebd9bhl,"I’m bipolar too and I have had the same thoughts most of my life... that I’m special, deserving of special treatment, smarter, more “worthy” than other people, and that magically everything will turn out great for me. Now that I am in my 50’s I have started to see myself more objectively. It’s a big emotional drop to go from decades of thinking I’m the GOAT to thinking that actually I’m a fucked up middle age guy who struggles to get through the week and do normal shit and not cause any damage to himself and others, and has never achieved anything of note in the world.",t3_a4auo4
