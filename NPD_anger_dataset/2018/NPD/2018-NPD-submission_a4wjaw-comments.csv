Well I'm still married so it didn't go too badly. She's become a bit of a narcissist herself, largely as a coping mechanism for dealing with my shit, so now she needs some help too.

It took a long time for her to take me at face value again. In fact occasionally she still thinks I'm trying to manipulate her, it's contributing to an ongoing communication problem, hence starting couples therapy soon. She also needs a therapist for herself, since at the same time everything went down with us, she had a fair bit of ugly stuff getting un-buried from her youth, so that's fun.

>**Any opinion or advice on the situation is welcome. Honestly I  suck at handling emotionally charged situations and I'm socially awkward  as fuck and I need all the help I can get.**

I guess it depends what you're looking to do? The way you write it out you almost sound like you think the relationship is still salvageable. Addressing my itch of curiousness, are you diagnosed? I only ask because this seems a little more extreme than garden variety NPD, something more like BPD or even an anti-social disorder.

Anyway, in terms of what to do, to be honest, I'd just leave him be. I don't even know why you two are still friends to be honest, after all that emotional damage, I'd just cut my losses and move on.",t3_a4wjaw

If you mean the friendship, yeah, I kind of hope so. He seemed hurt when I cut him off, but that was 8 years ago, I don't know.

I really can't complain about my life now, but I tend to feel like nobody really gets me. My boyfriend knows all about my past and how my mind works but there's a part of me that will always be out of his grasp. Because he's sane. He doesn't understand how intense my emotions can get like a person with a PD or a codependent/empath/whatever they're called these days would.

I feel like this is the only person that could really get me and that I could have a healthy relationship with. But I can pass without it.

If it didn't get to that, but I could lift a weight from his shoulders, improve his life even if it's just a little, that'd make me happy too. But I'm dubious I have the power to do even that little at this point. I'm afraid could just find it unwarranted or annoying.

>Addressing my itch of curiousness, are you diagnosed? I only ask because this seems a little more extreme than garden variety NPD, something more like BPD or even an anti-social disorder.

No, I'm not officially diagnosed. I've been to therapy but never lasted more than a few sessions each time. I'm gonna try again soon and we'll see.

With only the information in this post, I see how it could look like BPD. But I don't really see the AsPD, mind to explain?

I could be BPD or comorbid. However there are many things about how I feel, think and behave that make me think NPD (leaning on the more covert/vulnerable side), but I haven't included them here because I didn't think they were relevant. In the end, I stick around NPD communities because I feel they're the more relevant to my experience. 

>Anyway, in terms of what to do, to be honest, I'd just leave him be. I don't even know why you two are still friends to be honest, after all that emotional damage, I'd just cut my losses and move on.

Beats me. It just happened organically. We kept contact for bureaucratic stuff, and every once in a while we would talk to the other for some other trivial thing. As if we were just cordial strangers on the internet and nothing happened.

I'm always leaning on leaving him be, that's the reason why I haven't said anything in 8 years. It's less of a hassle, less risky, I don't need it, and he doesn't need it. But maybe that's what would make it great, not needing it but wanting to be in each other's life anyway. That's only my point of view thought, I have no idea of what he would like.

Thank you for your input, I hope the couples therapy goes well.",t3_a4wjaw

Don't know either of you enough to really say one way or the other. Generally, people are usually interested in reconnecting after a long spell. But of course you abused him. But of course he also seemed to overlook it previously. It's hard to say.

The only way you're really going to find out is by reaching out, and I wouldn't say there's anything wrong with that. Just take it slow, make it clear that you aren't obligating him or expecting anything other than just hitting up an old friend to get back to talking, and see what he says. And do be prepared, mentally, for him to either tell you to pound sand or just not respond; you got your answer there, even if it wasn't the one you'd hoped for.

Speaking as someone who has reconnected with old friends I hadn't talked to for years (and not even as many years) I'm glad he reached out, but again, we didn't have the same history as you two, so if you want to know, send him a message. Just again be prepared for it to go negative, and in such a case, move on.

>With only the information in this post, I see how it could look like BPD. But I don't really see the AsPD, mind to explain?

Well I mainly brought it up because a BPD who is unmedicated usually has an extremely hard time controlling themselves, which you seem to have at least a partial grip on the proverbial wheel. I'm no doctor, though, so I'd cede that theory to one of course.

From the sounds of things your emotions do run a lot higher than most people's, and that can be a symptom of NPD. It's hard to say.

>That's only my point of view thought, I have no idea of what he would like.

Yeah, neither of you need it but that doesn't mean you wouldn't like to have it. It seems like at least a decent portion of you wants to talk to him. And at this point, I don't see what you'd have to lose by trying. I'd say go for it, and just prepare for the worst.",t3_a4wjaw
ebk19xk,t1_ebif2j9,"I feel fully equipped now to deal with a negative response.

But I think I don't want to cause him any further inconvenience. Apologizing, even if I try to be very delicate, would put him in the position of at least having to consider my feelings, and to think about the stuff that happened. It would compensate if I knew it would make him happy or relieve him of some burden, but I have no guarantee of that. Most people who have been in a similar place are saying that they'd be weirded out if not directly annoyed by an apology at this point, which is what I feared, so I think I'll pass. I've seen many victims complain about their abuser being unapologetic though.

It's kind of sad. I've apologized and promised change countless times, always with nothing but the best intentions in mind, but it amounted to nothing because I was in no position to promise such thing. Change or true understanding was just completely beyond my capacity. Now things are different, but it's just too late. I don't think anybody with a Cluster B personality disorder wouldn't need at least years to go from abusive to moderately reasonable. So it will always be too late.

I'll write the apology anyway as an exercise for myself, even if I don't send it.

I guess we'll keep talking for bureaucratic stuff and sending each other messages on special occasions a couple times a year. I may try bringing the communication up a notch and see if he seems comfortable with it. If I ever see a clear sign that he would benefit from an apology or an explanation I'll give it to him.

Thank you for taking the time to discuss this with me, these conversations help me make up my mind. ",t3_a4wjaw

ec4oilt,t1_ec0zqzg,"I wouldn't mind if he didn't want to be friends. But you're right, I'm used to not being aware of my motives, so I force myself to think of every selfish reason I could have for taking a decision when I have to. And yeah, I've considered that I may only want to apologize just because I feel lonely, among other things.

Even if I don't think that's what's motivating me, this technique helps with anticipating unpleasant outcomes, dismantling twisted patterns of thought, improving self-awareness, etc.

Good luck with your recovery.",t3_a4wjaw
