ec0036o,t3_a731jq,"NPD causes you to be hypersensitive, which means you can get people's opinion about you wrong. You can get triggered by really small things which may even just be an idiosyncracy of that person.

I also do imagine that some doctors can see through the NPD facade quite quickly, so you may be right that some of them don't like you. Nobody likes being lied to, and a facade means you are lying to peoples faces about your very nature. So when they see through it, they realise there's nothing positive to be had from your interactions.

Can you give an example of how you ""argue with the doctor""? Do you play the game [""why don't you... yes but""?](http://www.ericberne.com/games-people-play/why-dont-you-yes-but/)",t3_a731jq

ec08k79,t1_ec07zjs,"OK, I can see why they might refuse your self prescribed ""treatment"". They are the doctor with years of medical education, and you perceive them to have inferior knowledge to yourself and refuse to entertain the thought that they might know what's best.

Listening to your input is different from them accepting your self prescription.

It enrages you that they would challenge you on it, and then it all goes downhill from there.",t3_a731jq
ec0k5my,t1_ec0jf2i,">They’re certified drug dealers and finessers, no different than me.

Wrong. Years of schooling. Years more of experience. You are not **that interesting** and it's your narcissism showing through. You can't be the best so obviously you're the most fucked up ever, and no, you aren't. You're just broken, like so many others. You aren't special.

> Don’t give me the bs, doctors exist because we hope they can help, and  it’s very easy for them to take advantage of this by making you jump  through more hoops than anyone should have to. 

Well which is it then? You can't say doctors don't know shit and aren't helping you, then allude to the fact that you were given a whole lot to do that you then didn't. So who isn't pulling their weight, you, or the doctors? I have a feeling I know the answer.

>  The thing is that every step to their version of progress involves money. 

Making it distinct from exactly nothing else. Maintenance takes work. Maintenance on the mind takes a LOT of work. Maintenance is done by professionals and has a cost. To be totally honest here though it sounds like you're wasting your money, because you aren't taking what they prescribe, not doing what they ask, and then you're sitting there all indignant asking ""why am I not fixed?"" No shit you aren't.",t3_a731jq

ec0ib48,t1_ec0hp8y,"Thanks for clarifying. I'm not a fan of medicating unless you absolutely have to. If you're in the US I think there is a problem where there is vested interest motivation on getting people onto meds because of a profit motive.

I'm personally not into marijuana because I get anxiety afterwards. But if it works for you good stuff.

Do you have a decent talk therapist/counsellor?",t3_a731jq

ec5ox7v,t1_ec0it19,"It's amazing that you've somehow managed to find all the therapists who ""never listen"" and ""don't really care."" That must be some really bad luck! 

OR, maybe you're the common denominator here. NPD makes it very difficult for you to perceive things accurately. 

You have a right to seek a second opinion and you have a right to terminate therapy. If you find yourself shuffling through doctors, it's time to consider that you're not using therapy appropriately. If you are unwilling to give it a real shot, then you're going to be stuck as you are. ",t3_a731jq
ec0ncgt,t1_ec0it19,"Thanks for sharing. I have a therapist that genuinely listens to me. But I make sure our sessions aren't just me spilling my emotional mess all over him, I try to make it a two way thing and I make it entertaining for him. I only have narcissistic tendencies though, I'm not at the pathological level I don't think. I was raised as an enabler, and I'm just working on unwinding that stuff and making sure I don't go back down a narcissistic path. I knew I couldn't go to a female counsellor because I don't think the chance of a woman understanding me are particularly high.",t3_a731jq
