eb8t2uc,t3_a3q140,"That's what I used to do a long time ago...I've gotten a lot better since then, but yeah, I thought it was like a ploy to make me feel guilty. I would get more cruel too at times...sometimes even laughing, just totally refusing to empathize.

Today, I feel deeply ashamed of having done that. How painful it must be to be treated that way by someone who is supposed to love you. 

These days, I wouldn't say I'm abusive. I've grown up a lot over the years. But I can still occasionally act like a jerk unfortunately, and if I get called on it, I don't always easily listen and remain open to the fact that once again, evidence says I'm not perfect. It can take a few minutes, at least. At least I no longer put up a wall, double down on cruelty or laugh. 

I think the key is to build self-compassion. Because then you can more easily conceive of accepting yourself even after admitting a mistake. Loving-kindness meditation (LKM) can help with this. I'll do it sometimes just walking around, say it in my head.

Also, I think it's helpful to tell your partner that you have this problem. It has helped with my present partner.

Good luck! You can get better.",t3_a3q140
ebf03zs,t3_a3q140,"When someone confronts me I usually lose (at least temporarily) any good feelings I may have for that person. I think it has to do with that object-relations thing, I can't conceive that you have something against me and that you are a lovable person at the same time.

If the person is being over-emotional in a ""weak"" way (looks hopeless, troubled, is crying, etc), it usually doesn't affect me much. I usually feel calm and amused as /u/Calithin said. I've been told that I smirk in these situations. I feel like I have the upper hand and that I'm the rational one. I usually say stuff like ""Grow up"" or ""Deal with it"".

If I'm emotionally affected by what the person is saying (maybe if they're challenging one of my self-concepts), it usually can go two ways:

* If it's a person I know I can outsmart, I'll get really angry and try to make them admit I'm right and they're wrong through manipulation, devaluing, etc.
* If it's a person who can keep up with me, I'll usually end up getting teary-eyed, have a tantrum, have a meltdown, say that I don't want to talk anymore and to leave me alone. I'll do what I can to get that person to shut up.

These are the reactions that come natural to me, but that doesn't mean that I think they're right or that I go with them every time. ",t3_a3q140
eb8sgtw,t3_a3q140,"Ugh, okay,

Foremost I am stepped back from \*my\* own emotions at times like those.

This is pretty sick but a part of me is amused/entertained. It feels like I just got teleported into the middle of a play or a tv scene and am one of the stars. I get to both act/watch this exciting scene unfold. It feels a little like a high-speed chess game, too, because in that position I am trying to maneuver (not always to manipulate or get myself out of it, really it is more about re-gaining the power or control in the situation that I have lost by being the ""wrong"" one. You can be wrong and in control or you can be wrong and subject to the whims/rules/punishments of whomsoever you did wrong to.) 

&#x200B;

Then... physically, I am usually very VERY calm (significantly more than my moment-to-moment baseline, even). I have read that abuser's heart-rates actually go down in abusive situations, whereas a normal person's (obviously) goes up. I get into this weird calm zone during intense, dramatic emotional times (whether confronted by an abusee or anything intensely in this manner, really). I am certain this was adapted from my childhood, which was chaotic/abusive/traumatic in its own ways. In this way I also do great in basically all emergencies, and have often considered a career as an EMT or FEMA worker, though am in Law currently. ",t3_a3q140
eb9h5as,t3_a3q140,"I’ve never been what is considered abusive to a girl, but I have some emotionally abuse traits. But my redeemable trait is that I admit when I’m wrong if it will improve relations. This isn’t what I have actually said to people, but it’s the mentality and mindset of getting confronted for things I’ve done in general.

If you confronted me, I would respond with something that makes me right. Even when it isn’t right, I make it sound right. If you question it, I’ll make myself right again, because I don’t think I should be questioned despite what I’ve done. There are reasons why I shouldn’t be in trouble for anything. I’m alive, because I have the physical ability to experience such great things, nothing should stop me from that.

Honestly, for someone to truly confront me, they have to break through so many psychological barriers. Me and my parents have many screaming matches, and they never get solved until they argue and make me realize I’m wrong. The average screaming match is 45mins to an hour.

It’s hard because I can come up with so many reasons that I’m right. I can come up with so many reasons people are wrong. I can discredit anyone and credit myself. I can make people misinterpret entire memories and events just by denying certain details. You just have to be assertive, you have to TELL them how you’re right. They are not as consciously aware during conversation as I am, they only think about what they have to say. They never think to deeply about what I say as long as I say it and sound right. And by doing that, I can easily curate an ingenious lie for myself. I will look you right in the face, knowing I am wrong, and without moving a facial muscle, I will lie flawlessly.",t3_a3q140
ebvv1cz,t3_a3q140,I feel how you do OP. People express their feelings to me in order to extort certain emotions - like guilt or shame - from me. People sharing their perspectives and feelings with me is manipulation and emotional extortion. ,t3_a3q140
eb89g7d,t3_a3q140,"I feel that a little bit, but more than that I feel like they need to deal with it and I'm upset with them for letting it happen if they're just going to complain about it later (if it's an ex-bf or something else in their control). If they're too young I honestly just get the feeling of ""shit happens to everyone, 80,000 kids died of starvation and bombings because of your lifestyle just this year.... who gives a shit that your dad yelled at you? Tell me how did you make it make you stronger and how you're going to use it as a resource rather than an excuse""

To be clear, these are the wrong feelings and I have my own stuff I want to talk about sometimes. So I just respond how they need me to respond. Most of the time they just need someone to listen, not give advice but give compliments along the lines of ""smart"" ""brave"" ""strong""and/or ""pretty"" depending on gender. While making me look like the only person who did the right thing, they can feel strong and good about themselves making both of our lives easier going forward.

Frame it. ""They will think the world of me if i'm the only one who did the right thing."" ""I can't solve this problem for them, but I can help them self-sufficient and that makes my life easier"" or ""If they feel empowered, they will be indebted to me without any maintained day to day work on my part""

.... It's probably not right... but I figure if the result is doing the right thing then who cares?",t3_a3q140
ecx0ce1,t3_a3q140,"I also feel like it's a manipulation attempt. And sometimes I find that I was right. Relationships are complicated. People are complicated. If you're not satisfied with what I'm offering, leave. I'm not going to bend over backwards to please anyone.",t3_a3q140

eb8skaw,t1_eb89g7d," I'm upset with them for letting it happen if they're just going to complain about it later  

I used to have a lot of this, too. A sort of ""if it were that bad you would have/should have left. accept some personal responsibility.""",t3_a3q140

ebfce7a,t1_ebfaart,"It's almost scary how narcissists seem to be made from the same mold.

If you haven't already, look into object-relations psychological theory. This article explains it in an easy way that is relevant for narcissists: [https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/understanding-narcissism/201708/the-truth-about-narcissistic-personality-disorder](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/understanding-narcissism/201708/the-truth-about-narcissistic-personality-disorder)

It helps explain why narcissists can be so cruel to their loved ones. Knowing about it reminds me to shut my mouth and not make drastic choices when I'm emotional, but more than that it helped my partner to understand why sometimes it seems like I don't love him or say hurtful stuff and to not take it personally.",t3_a3q140
