I have been thinking this exact post for many months now. I don’t even need to add anything to what you’ve said: you’ve said exactly what I’ve been thinking internally for many months. Reading your post, is like thinking my thoughts. I feel punched in the gut.",t3_a6a3a8
ec3uymq,t3_a6a3a8,"I can definitely relate. I was suicidal from when I was 13 (my first heartbreak) until I was 25 (my most serious suicide attempt). There wasn't one whole week when I didn't think about ending it all at least once. I was in pain all the time and it was soothing to think that there was always that route to end the pain I felt. I'd search for painless ways to die on the Internet or go looking high places to jump from for self-soothing.

I think that I was so hypersensitive that I needed the world to work in a certain way to avoid getting hurt. I was desperate to control my surroundings so the people I mingled with couldn't hurt me, and I behaved in hurtful and dishonest ways to achieve that. Whatever reminder that the world didn't work the way I needed would trigger the thought of wanting to die, and I wanted to avoid it at all costs.

I think that everything I do in my life will be ultimately pointless. Even if I managed to change history somehow, humanity will disappear one day. The only way I figured I could gave meaning to my life was through relationships. But I also came to realize that I'd probably never have the relationship I wanted. How was that possible if every time I entered a relationship I was soon feeling numb and wanting to get out? Nobody seemed to be enough for me to stay with with for ""eternity"", nobody seemed to be enough to make me forget about any other guys or possibilities or to make my feelings for them stay in place.

In the end at 25, I decided I'd end it all. Scheduled an email to get sent in 24h to a person I trusted to take charge of everything I left behind, got very drunk, and went to a high bridge to jump from. But even wasted as I was, the existential vertigo was too much. I stayed there what seemed like hours looking down, just saying to myself ""just one jump, one little jump and everything will be over, the pain will be gone"", but I was horrified by the thought of not feeling anything anymore again, and in the end I went back home defeated. Then and there I knew I would never be able to take my own life.

Ideally, I would have wanted to die feeling like I was right and showing everyone else, but it was impossible. Only then my worldview started becoming more flexible and I started accepting different realities to my own. That was the first time I accepted going to therapy. I didn't care anymore if everything I believed in was destroyed, I didn't care about being brainwashed, I just wanted the pain to stop somehow.

My line of though nowadays is that, I have no lust for life but I'm not eager to die. It will happen sooner or later whether I want it or not, so why rush it? I just want to go through life feeling as little pain as possible and who knows, I may be pleasantly surprised every once in a while.

I think accepting I'll always feel dissatisfied as it's part of my personality made me a more stable person. Now I don't even try to fix it or conceal it, since I know it doesn't work and usually makes the situation worse. I just try to appreciate a lot more the limited tidbits of satisfaction life gives me.

If I think about it, the idea of suicide lost a lot of it's appeal if I imagined that no one would know about it. So even the parts about being in pain and wishing to stop existing were true, I may have not been so obsessed with the idea if it hadn't been for the attention it brought and the thought of people getting hurt because of me. So certainly pity and spite were a big aspect of this.",t3_a6a3a8

Everything you said about feeling fake and other people seeing you as real even though you've faked everything absolutely resonates. You're not alone. Also, our real selves haven't developed properly so of course they don't really have opinions or values. Its not that you mentally died, you just haven't been alive for a long long time.

eglbwro,t3_a6a3a8,"Avoiding relationships causes loneliness which causes depression. Human contact is mandatory for normal wellbeing.

At the same time you also get narcissistic injury because you do not get any supply as you do not have relationships and can't by definition manufacture this supply internally like neurotypicals do. This makes the depression even worse to the point it could be felt as physical pain.

If all your existence is suffering, no wonder it is not worth to live it.

Suicidal thoughts are the result of chronic pain caused by depression. Go and have relationships. When your supply is restored you will feel a lot better. If you do not want to damage other people, keep them emotionally at a distance so they can't get hurt, learn about yourself.",t3_a6a3a8

In the moment I wrote this, i genuinely felt helpless and needed some sort of reassurance.   I wasn't rubbing my hands, devising a way to pull one over on people.  I felt the pain.  I'm distanced from my emotions, yes.  And i have a sense that no part of me is genuine, but that separation and confusion is where my pain comes from. 

I didn't see it as a ploy at the time because there wasn't an alternative motive.  Its not calculated.  But looking back, i think this is just the need for attention coming out.  Its the nature of the beast.   ",t3_a6a3a8
egpbyhe,t1_eglbwro,"Thanks for the nice comment.  For a while I've felt on the edge of narcissism and reality.  I thought that the best way to go about my issue was to face it head on.  But I don't think I can function without supply.  I'm going to a therapist and trying... but I don't know if healing is possible.  The people who knew me and are close to me know me as a certain person.  You're right, I don't think I CAN be that person on my own.  But I'd feel shitty putting the bag over someone's head so I could live my life.  I came from such a circumstance and I've seen the pain caused by a close relationship like that.

I'm glad it helped you. I often find comments in this sub comforting. It's like ""finally, someone who gets it"".

>How can you find meaning in relationships though if you can't really invest yourself in them?

I don't try to find meaning in relationships anymore. I don't try to find meaning in anything. I've found that I can live my life without it having any meaning. Because the grim reality is that it probably doesn't. Accepting this is probably the most soul-crushing thing I've ever done in my life. If I had had the courage to kill myself back then, I would have.

Counterintuitively, this realization has made me a more stable person that can stay in relationships. Now I don't burden the other person in the relationship with giving meaning to my life. I don't expect them to be everything I've ever wanted. People can come and go freely into my life without me panicking or raging because I know my life doesn't depend on them.

The truth is that when I first realized that nobody would ever be able to make me happy, I gave up on intimate relationships. I knew my ape brain would demand at least a support network of superficial friendships to get by, and that was enough for me. The new goal was not to give meaning to my life but to go through life feeling as little pain as possible so I wouldn't feel the need to die. These friendships were enough to cover my social needs without getting into vulnerable (and thus unstable) territory.

I remember time ago that my concepts of friendship and love were extremely idealistic and romantic (and unattainable). And I was proud of not settling for less. I discarded and offended people who considered themselves my friends because they didn't fit my standards. Finding myself pursuing these kinds of relationships I had dismissed in the past was a humbling experience.

I just can't take the good things that happen to me for granted anymore. I appreciate that in this cruel, meaningless universe, I was able to see something beautiful, that I was able to have a good time, or that someone took the time to think of me. That's how ""low"" I've sunk.

I currently have a boyfriend. But the truth is that I wasn't eager to start. I was like ""Look, I like you, but in all honestly when I'm in a relationship I always stop feeling in love and want to get out after a while (I didn't know about NPD back then but I knew that much) and I really can't afford to ruin our friendship right now"". He said that he was aware of my personality quirks and that even then he wanted to give it a try, and that if the worst happened he'd try his best to keep being friends. So we gave it a try and we've been together for 4 years.

He enriches my life, but he's not the meaning of my life. I can deal with the relationship not being perfect and I can deal with the thought of being single again, even for the rest of my life, if it comes to that.

>I feel guilty even entertaining the idea of having a significant other because i know from the get-go i wouldn't have any intentions of being vulnerable or honest. I don't know how to do that.

Why are you so sure that you can't be vulnerable and honest, if that's what you want? Why do you think you can't work on that with a therapist? Are you afraid that you're going to get rejected if you're honest?

It's true that I struggle too with honesty and vulnerability, because there are too many things that go through my mind that I either know are hurtful or I'm ashamed of, that I see no point in sharing them. I feel like it can only go wrong, that people are going to either get mad at me or laugh at me. And I can't deal with that because I'm sensitive like a baby.

However I don't feel hopeless or guilty about it. I hope I can work on it. And that's just a part of what I am, I can bring other stuff to the table. I've sometimes found comfort in the thought of being an irredeemable piece of shit, but in the end I think it's just victim mentality: if I can't change, if this is just what I am, I don't have to take responsibility for it or do anything about it.

>And what do you mean by being brainwashed? Of what could the therapist convince you of? In my mind, you are referring to forgetting that you're an outcast and adopting the idea that you are like everyone else... just a shot from the hip.

I don't think therapy is brainwashing anymore, but I used to say that... I'm not sure what I meant with that. I'll have to think about it. I think having to assume I'm not special probably had to do with it. Changing my way of thinking felt like an unacceptable defeat somehow. But here we are.

Anyway, this is just the way I've dealt with my suicidal thoughts and I'm pretty sure it's far from the best. Just food for thought, not really wanting to set an example, lol.",t3_a6a3a8
