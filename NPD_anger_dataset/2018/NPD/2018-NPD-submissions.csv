I absolutely hate when people are disrespectful to me: Telling me to “shut up” is a big one, being rude, obnoxious, shutting down my requests (regardless of how reasonable) without a single thought. All around disrespect

The old me would blow up on people, and start shouting, and calling them names

The new me recognizes that this disrespect and negativity is a by product of their negative state of perception

However, there’s still a strong part of me they believes that *you get what you earn*, and with that in mind, I get really upset
I refrain from blowing up on people now, but I don’t know what the alternative it without looking like a pussy boy

And the fear of looking like a pussy boy, when I respond passively, causes me deep suffering

Fight types are unconsciously driven by the belief that power and control can create safety, assuage abandonment and secure love. Children who are spoiled and given insufficient limits (a uniquely painful type of abandonment) and children who are allowed to imitate the bullying of a narcissistic parent may develop a fixated fight response to being triggered. These types learn to respond to their feelings of abandonment with anger and subsequently use contempt, a toxic amalgam of narcissistic rage and disgust, to intimidate and shame others into mirroring them and into acting as extensions of themselves. 

The entitled fight type commonly uses others as an audience for his incessant monologizing, and may treat a ""captured"" freeze or fawn type as a slave or prisoner in a dominance-submission relationship. Especially devolved fight types may become sociopathic, ranging along a continuum that stretches between corrupt politician and vicious criminal. 

TX: Treatable fight types benefit from being psychoeducated about the prodigious price they pay for controlling others with intimidation. Less injured types are able to see how potential intimates become so afraid and/or resentful of them that they cannot manifest the warmth or real liking the fight type so desperately desires. I have helped a number of fight types understand the following downward spiral of power and alienation: excessive use of power triggers a fearful emotional withdrawal in the other, which makes the fight type feel even more abandoned and, in turn, more outraged and contemptuous, which then further distances the ""intimate"", which in turn increases their rage and disgust, which creates increasing distance and withholding of warmth, ad infinitem. Fight types need to learn to notice and renounce their habit of instantly morphing abandonment feelings into rage and disgust. As they become more conscious of their abandonment feelings, they can focus on and feel their abandonment fear and shame without transmuting it into rage or disgust - and without letting grandiose overcompensations turn it into demandingness.

Unlike the other 4Fs, fight types assess themselves as perfect and project the inner critic's perfectionistic processes onto others, guaranteeing themselves an endless supply of justifications to rage. Fight types need to see how their condescending, moral-high-ground position alienates others and perpetuates their present time abandonment. Learning to take self-initiated timeouts at the first sign of triggering is an invaluable tool for them to acquire. Timeouts can be used to accurately redirect the lion's share of their hurt feelings into grieving and working through their original abandonment, rather than displacing it destructively onto current intimates. Furthermore, like all 4F fixations, fight types need to become more flexible and adaptable in using the other 4F responses to perceived danger, especially the polar opposite and complementary fawn response described below. They can learn the empathy response of the fawn position - imagining how it feels to be the other, and in the beginning ""fake it until they make it."" Without real consideration for the other, without reciprocity and dialogicality, the real intimacy they crave will remain unavailable to them.

I started meditating a year ago, it made me more introspective, so i decided to seek therapy over my terrible depression. Turns out i have NPD, i got diagnosed with NPD about five months ago. I have accepted it on both an intellectual level (Based on these behaviors i exhibit i must have NPD) as well as an emotional level (I have first hand witnessed the way these thought processess cause me suffering), and am making progress in treating it with meditation and therapy.

I feel like i have memory problems, and i wonder if this is the NPD, in the sense of i would constantly re invent myself and repress my old self every so often.

Over time, we became pretty friendly. He is a really nice guy, army veteran, but was always having financial struggles and for quite a while now has been basically homeless staying at various people’s places or living in his car, and I would help him out here and there by fronting him money, letting him stay in an empty apartment I had for a short time, finding other jobs for him etc.

I had been really depressed lately and was isolating myself and was just starting to get better. I texted him because I hadn’t talked to him for a couple of weeks and asked how we was. He said things were pretty bad  because he had quit smoking a couple of weeks
ago and has been having a bad cough and not breathing that well when walking up stairs, etc and that he was driving for lyft but he had a minor car accident recently and now has to wait a week or so to drive for lyft again and basically is broke and he has an appointment in a week or so at the VA doctor to check out his cough. He alluded that he is living in his car. 

My first inclination was what I usually do which is to say hey if you need help I can help you out and maybe invite him to stay at my place or give him money or put him up in a motel or something. 

But this time I was thinking to myself that I can’t always bail him out every time he needs money and also I was feeling like if I asked him to stay with me it was going to not be emotionally good for me since I had been so depressed lately and was just starting to get better. So I kind of just said “damn that sucks” but didn’t offer any help. In my mind I figured I’d give it a couple of days and check in with him again and then figure out the best way to help him.

Two days later I get a text from his son saying his dad passed away the night before (so he died basically about 24 hours after I texted him). I didnt ask how because I was afraid to know... did he kill himself?
did he die from the cough?

I’m going to meet up with his son tomorrow and get more details. And funeral is this coming Saturday.

I am riddled with guilt. Why didn’t I offer to help him right away? Why did I put it off?

I’m not saying I acted this way because I’m narcissistic (FYI Im not full blown NPD but am high on the spectrum. I also have light bipolar I would say) but there was definitely some selfishness on my part. I just didn’t want to be with him - or anybody really - at the time and felt like he needed to work things out on his own at least for a while longer.  I thought he was basically ok and had no idea how badly sick he was from his text. He never actually asked me for help and living in his car was not that unusual for him, so I didn’t see it as an immediate crises.

I needed to get this off my chest. Thanks

Here is my struggle and new existential crisis about it. Is it possible to CURE SPD + NPD?",7,11,1545319069.0,"Hey all... it's nice to find a sub about this on reddit.

I am almost sure that I have NPD in a pretty extreme part of its scale, mixed with a great deal of SPD. I will share some bits of my story and I would love to read some feedback now that I am so confused.

At first, I would like to know: is it possible for one who does have a narc personality to change its inner impressions? I love attention, I love feeling special, I love comparing to others, even knowing that each person has his own talents and special stuff, with myself knowing I don't deserve more than the ones around me. I manage to keep my impressions with myself and I am very gentle talking to people, not doing jokes with targets and never humiliating others... but deep inside, I am having delight at some degree loving myself. I wonder if it's ok to feel like that if I manage to do a rational effort to do good deeds and charity (without wanting attention for this), trying to find a balance on 'karma' for the selfish ways I feel pleasure... but also, because even if I don't feel it, I know that is the right thing to do.

Given all this, what follows is a wall of text with lots of parts of my personal story. You can skip that if you have no interest or if you can relate... my doubts can be answered without reading it, but I guess the story can present a strong contexto for understanding what I really am. I will put a OPTIONAL separation below.

\----------(OPTIONAL)------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think I have SPD to some degree because, since I know myself, I barely have sex drive if any, feeling pleasure only in more specific porn videos. But outside home, I don't feel sexual attraction looking to people, I remember as a teenager opening a porn magazine and seeing that with the same effects that I see a blank wall. I consider myself assexual (while sober, but I will keep this detail for later).

Some other things that feed this SPD conjecture of mine: I have musical anhedonia (and I think my dad has it too given that he doesn't listen to music)... its pretty rare for me to really appreciate the music for what it is, BUT, I can fantasize myself as being a great lead singer with my own style, and then I feel pleasure listening to the stuff. Also, I don't feel pleasure in almost all 'normal' things that people have as hobbies: sports, nature, hiking, animals, travels... nothing like these feeds my soul with happiness: what I really like to do is showing off my talents and my style in a karaoke, dressing differently to express myself and liking to feel 'unique', playing videogames or boardgames with my friends or talk about subjects related that do interest me, but there is vanity/pride even when I talk: I like the way I express myself talking, and I feel pleasure showing a good opinion on some subject.

And maybe the core suspicion that feeds my SPD + NPD conjecture at all: I barely feel empathy. I have to do a great rational effort to put myself in the place of the people around me. I am gentle and with a false modesty... I know how to wear a mask to be the 'cool guy' around people, some people think I am humble, but that is because I know how to use my personas very well. Deep insight, I want to feel special... when I sing a song or do something very interesting at my job and people come to praise me, I tell them that ""oh, it was nothing..."", or ""it wasn't that good... you think so?"", but inside, I am feeling delight of the recognition. And I don't need the acceptance to feel happy with who I am: I can sing a song or dress in a way that people think is ridiculous, but I don't bother... why should I if I am not hurting or harming anyone? The golden rule is my rational guide.

The thing that impressed me and I also think that it feeds more the SPD hypothesis is that when I smoke weed, I can feel pleasure in music for what it is, I can feel a little more empathetic, and from a assexual I become almost a hedonist. And oh, I do enjoy nature and hiking when I am high. But marijuana is a double-edge sword for me: it can make my anxiety and ocd skyrocket. With my father once hearing voices for days after smoking weed (I know the relationship of SPD and schizo in the spectrum), and with his musical anhedonia and also a huge lack of empathy, I think all those things are evidence of maybe a strong genetic component that explain my context.

I think after all that I shared I don't need to go much in detail about the narcissistical component (besides, all the bullet points of the NPD symptoms matches me lol). I barely feel empathy and I like admiration, but I use my rational part to guide me on doing what is right (when someone asks me help for example). I can be manipulative: being aparently very gentle to reach my goals. I remember this girl on my bachelor in math: I was being alone in the course because I disliked the people from my classroom. But by that time, I felt ashamed to walk alone, and this girl was giving me attention and walking with me. I didn't think that she was beautiful or interesting, but I was keeping the conversations even while thinking that her subjects were boring because I didn't want to feel alone. She always lended her notebook for me to take some copies from the classes, I was very dependable on her notes. I knew that she liked me, I knew that and I still kept this kind of relationship, without a conciouss idea that I was being a scumbag. Then I started dating a girl that she hated and she had the insight: she came into myself in a chat and told me how she felt used. Indeed... deep inside I knew this, but I became more conciouss about it. I tried to be gentle and make her calm, but dude, that wasn't right, and I didn't know by this time.

I am like this since I remember. I never felt impressed by stuff that normal people would feel about it. My parents could tell me something incredible from the outside world and I could give the answer that they were expecting but inside I was like 'uh, ok, boring'. One of these days my dad told me that a friend of his that already helped me got robbed in his house. I told him ""hm, that sucks, I hope he is ok now""... but when he shared this I felt NOTHING, I used my rational part and I know that situation sucks, so that is why I answered this way.

Even my parents see me as robot-like. They see me as this since my youth, they recognize that I am far from 'normal'.

Now... I had this insight with drugs that made me notice the toxic, cold, manipulative person that I was being the whole life. I started to notice how I almost didn't do nothing to contribute with this world: I extracted tons of energy from it and I gave almost nothing back. With this perception, I did a long self-study and entered in a journey of self-knowledge... I noticed how I always was like this... how this is my nature and stuff. Now I wonder: what next? What should I do with this? I feel that I can't be happy without this inside thoughts of being special and unique, I barely feel empathy and I have pratically no pleasure in things that are not competitive or don't boost my ego. The idea of killing my ego makes me hugely depressed to the point of making me lose my will to live: I don't see myself happy changing my personality.

It's maybe worth sharing that I have a severe level of OCD: I am almost always overthinking, repeating thoughts for hours, spending tons of energy of mine in non-productive ways. I don't know if this is related to all this in some spectrum.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

Should I violent myself to change my sponteneous way of thinking? The solution I had in my mind was that, knowing how my mind works, I could use it in favor of myself and the people around me: I can keep this feeling of superiority and being special, even if its not a true thing... I can keep my pride (but I will keep this to me, I mean, there is pride even in the way I talk to others due to my way of self-expressing, but I will not humiliate others and I will try to keep the special thing to me). BUT, I have to manage my behavior: I decided to not engage with people or girls if I have no interest on them, or then making clear the kind of relationship that I expect; I decided to try to pay more attention on what people are talking, trying to see their virtues and doing a effort to find the interesting parts of what they are sharing; I decided to practice empathy, even if in a rational way, putting myself in the others place and knowing that the people might need help, and that I could offer it even if I feel like a robot inside, but because I know what is the right thing to do; I am now with a good job and earning a good salary, I might find stuff that I can contribute to (even I already intend to help my family).

Now, I ask you again: is it possible to change this inner stuff about feeling special and comparing yourself to others? I can't see myself stopping it, and when I think about the possibility or obligation, I get hugely depressed. To change this would demand to almost kill my personality, if not kill at all: to control my jokes, to control my dressing, to control my thoughts when I am singing, to control the reaction when people give me a compliment... it would be something very unnatural to me. Is it worth to violent myself this way? Or is it futile because it's something inherent in my core, my nature, that I can't change? Is managing my behaviour to be someone good to myself and good or at least not toxic to the people around me good enough? I am going into a guilt trip here almost going to an ascetic (and probably unhappy) life because of dogmatic stuff from society and etc. I wonder if its OK to be happy in my own ways if I don't harm or parasite on others.

Any light on this would be very, VERY appreciated. Thank you.

So, I think I might have NPD. ASPD is also a consideration. This is gonna sound real edgy btw

​

I definitely showed a lot of symptoms as a kid, (for both ASPD and NPD) and got into a lot of trouble. I remember a lot of the teachers and my parents telling me that I think I'm better than them and stuff, but I don't think I really cared, I didn't see why I had to listen to anyone, and it gave me a good laugh. I had a bit of a tough childhood, faced some abuse and was often bullied.

anyways, on to the symptoms

Common symptoms: grandiosity, callous and unemotional traits, disregard for others' feelings, excessive need for admiration, or social isolation

Yep, yep, yep, yep, and and at times? it functions weirdly for me. I have high standards for friends, and over time they bore me, so I just forget about them and stop caring. If there are certain advantages to being this person's friend I'll keep them around, and I'll befriend someone even if I don't like them if they're important or easily manipulated. Anyways, at times I just want to be on my own. Despite enjoying the attention, I just think people are eh.

Have an exaggerated sense of self-importance
Have a sense of entitlement and require constant, excessive admiration
Expect to be recognized as superior even without achievements that warrant it
Exaggerate achievements and talents
Be preoccupied with fantasies about success, power, brilliance, beauty or the perfect mate
Believe they are superior and can only associate with equally special people
Monopolize conversations and belittle or look down on people they perceive as inferior
Expect special favors and unquestioning compliance with their expectations
Take advantage of others to get what they want
Have an inability or unwillingness to recognize the needs and feelings of others
Be envious of others and believe others envy them
Behave in an arrogant or haughty manner, coming across as conceited, boastful and pretentious
Insist on having the best of everything — for instance, the best car or office
No, I deserve my love for myself
I can be sort of entitled tbh

Used to do this as a kid, now I have enough and don't need to exaggerate them anymore
A large amount of the first three, and for the fifth in a good mate, I see someone who is attractive, not annoying to be around, easy to manipulate, and has advantages to them. Such as money, doing house work, etc.
definitely
yeah
yeah
yeah
I just don't care honestly
In a way ig
Not really, I fake my personality a lot of times so people don't mistrust me. I might come off as cocky at worst
Definitely
I also fit a lot of the symptoms in that I lie, manipulate and cheat others a lot. I don't really see anything wrong with it and I don't care. If I'm being honset, I don't care about anyone, at all. I often fake a personality or fake being charismatic to get people's trust, or in case they are important later. I've also seen that when people with NPD tend to like something, they get really obssessed with it, which is true for me. It is similar in a way with people. If I actually like the person, I tend to really like them at first, and over time I get bored and irritated of them.

Told you it was edgy.

Oh also, I suspect my dad is a narcissist don't wanna go shane dawson mode tho

I feel that I've mentally died.  There is a part of me that knows I shouldn't be in relationships, so I've accepted (pretty much) that I'll never have a real human relationship in my life.  So what is the point?   
Nobody can understand this, not family, not the therapist.  Absolutely no one.  Correct me if I'm wrong but at the heart of narcissism is a deeply held secret that only you know: you will not and can not EVER be seen.  Absolutely never.  Even if you ""wanted"" to.  Also, every aspect of every persona you adopt is absolutely fake.  But those closest will never know.  I even get a sense that people on here say they care... but c'mon guys in reality you know the fucking monster I'm talking about. 

I liken waking up to Narcissism as waking up to realize that you were living in a dream.  In reality you are a blind quadriplegic with no tongue, yet somehow you are also a broadway star... and expected to perform a lead role that day... every day... My point is, that I've woken up to the fact that my real self is so emotionally retarded that it can't function in society.  At work I try to make an impression with someone only to realize that I'm just being who I think they want me to be.  I do this for absolutely everyone I know.  Everything i say about myself is a lie.  I say it so well and people see me as a real person because their minds aren't broken.  I'm just a coward of life.  My opinions, values, likes, dislikes, and hobbies are not my own.  They belong to a world which i hate yet try so vainly to please.  

I'm just frustrated with life.  I'm only 25 and feel that I want to die every day.  I've gone as far as putting my dad's shotgun in my mouth to see if i can reach the trigger.  Not loaded,  just messing around.  but it still scares me that i'm this far gone.  I never imagined I'd be this low.  Then there's a voice in the back of my head that tells me, ""yeah but you're only thinking about suicide to eventually receive pity in the future"".  And I don't know who to believe.  All i know is that I'm deep in depression because I've woken up to the fact that my whole history consists of being a fake.  There is no hope for me that i can say i genuinely feel.  I think all hope is just denial of the void. 

And i know that i could make myself happy by getting into a relationship... but it would all be fake.  I dont know if i'd feel as bad when in the relationship though... but knowing what lurks within me, at this point in time i feel responsible to society.  Its like killing myself will allow me to connect as best as i can with people around me.  "

It just means ""bad guy."" 

The idea that everyone with these traits is somehow an abusive monster above reproach is beyond counter productive. It is in fact a simple way to dump people into ""dont have to deal with"" category as with so many other things. Sexism, racism, whateverism. These things, like it or not, have been stretched to meet the NARROWEST of criteria, that the negative connotation is lost. Abuse of what should be meaningful terms. I just see a parallel here.

I seem to line up with a lot of covert narcissistic shit. But I don't abuse people. I don't have many relationships to afford me the opportunity, granted, however, through life experience and personal ideology, I have mostly kept the behavioral aspects in check. I will get that narcissistic rage once in a while. And the rare time it does go beyond my control, I apologize. I recognize what it is and that its wrong. Mostly, the aspects of me that conform so much with the disorder make me down right unlikable.

This is deep shit. For someone like me, its attuned my thinking in a powerful way because it helps me understand why I think the way I do. I've been able to start recognizing these thought patterns so I can attempt to change them.

It could be very helpful if people understood what it meant more. But as it is, I think its used as a weapon mostly, to justify hate and often over reactions to benign shit, and victimhood. NOT ALWAYS. Look, you think everyone's parent is a fucking narcissist? Well, according to reddit, they are. How fucking useful is that?"

Recently a user answered to my first post, in which I argued that narcs do not willfully plan their actions. As a self-aware narc, I am not allowed to respond directly in the [r/narcissisticAbuse](https://www.reddit.com/r/narcissisticAbuse) sub, but I learned to respect that. Moreover I would like to point out that I want this discussion to be respectful, which is why I thank you for your kind words at the beginning of your text. I will try to reply as clearly as possible.

*"" Even if they don't actively plan it out, they spend the entire relationship subconsciously plotting an exit plan that ultimately maximizes the damage they cause us. At the least, they don't care about the pain they inevitably cause. At the most, they enjoy causing it. ""*

You mention the word ""subconsciously"" various times throughout the text. The cambridge dictionary definition for subconscious is as follows: "" **the part of your** **mind that notices and remembers** **information when you are not actively** **trying to do so, and influences** **your** **behaviour** **even though you do not realize it** "". We can agree on that one. When it comes to the pain we cause, I can only say that we do not have **the ability** to care about the pain we cause, at least If we dont work on it. We enjoy the abuse, but its the same kind of ""joy"" that a drugaddict experiences when taking drugs. Ultimately it does not benefit us (and definetely does not benefit you). The pain we cause just feeds our sick ego, which will also harm us in the long run as well.

*"" What was the first thing all of our narcs did? Try to find out everything there was to know about us, of course. Their appetite for knowledge about us was insatiable. Why? It's because they know, subconsciously at least, that later they'll need to know all our weaknesses for the sake of their own ""self defense"" or ""revenge,"" and they'll need to know it pronto. It's the same tactic used in cult inductions. Can't tell when one of those uppity neurotypicals will need to be brought back into line, after all. It also helps to know everything about us in the meantime so they can morph into whatever archetype we need to heal our childhood issues ""*

Im sorry, but no. We do not engage in relationships in order to plan our evil exit beforehand. Relationships which include narcissistic abuse are always codependent relationships: Just like we fill some sort of void in you, you fill some sort of void in us. The abusive characteristics come into play when both people with childhood trauma interact with each other. It might sound silly, but: Narcissism and Codependency have a lot in common, atleast when it comes to their psychological origins. Narcs had to play a ""role"" in order to get love and affection, while codependents only feel themselves when they fully give up their own interests for the sake of others. Its not (and never will be) a onesided phenomenon, where the narc preys upon the codependent. It might seem that way, but it simply isn't. No matter how much pain was caused.

"" *That's not normal. That's not natural. Moving at that conversational pace indicates the brain is entering an unsustainable obsessive mode, rather than approaching getting to know this new person from a long-term and more balanced perspective. The best you could say about it is that it's how 13 year olds act when they get crushes. I remember my Nex wouldn't even let me give full answers to his questions on our first date because he was so eager to know everything else about me.* ""

True. The way we narcs approach relationships is quite childish, since our emotional development got crippled.

""*This strategy of exposing our weaknesses is calculated from the moment they assess us as potentially juicy victims*.""

See my answer above.

""*\[...\] The real question is, how far in the depths of their consciousness does this realization lie? And how could we possibly know what layer of their consciousness it lies in, since their M.O. is to uphold their delusional framework of understanding the world, at all times? If they lie to even themselves, how could we possibly hope to uncover the truth for them? And if we manage to uncover it, what can we do when they only shut us down for speaking the truth? Especially if it threatens their precious delusional narrative.*""

You cant uncover the truth for us. Its simply not possible. A narc has to understand on his own how to deal with his toxic behaviour.

But then again, we sincerely believe that whatever we do to you is justified. A narc has to find a way to get around his own toxic belief-system. Usually, this happens when they completely hit rock-bottom. Atleast thats when I began to change.

""*\[..\] maybe they don't even want to destroy us consciously; but you can bet your ass that subconsciously they know something about them is deeply fucked up. Ultimately the reason they're so persuasive during the lovebombing and devaluation stages is because they believe their own delusional fantasies first, and then suck us into them too using sweet, empty promises.*""

True, only with the difference that we believe our own ""sweet, empty promises"". But then again, knowing something **subconsciously** excludes to possibility of **actively** planning something. Please keep that in mind.

"" *In other words, the best case scenario is that they subconsciously know they will hurt us when they start dating us. The worst case scenario is they consciously set out to hurt us.* ""

Lets assume the best case scenario ;). I will redefine your definition and say that we are ""subconsciously set out to hurt you to feed our toxic belief-system that hurts us as well as everyone around us"". Again, I will have to point out that, atleast in the long run, narcissists will always end up miserable and alone if they do not stop their toxic behaviour. Superficially, we seem to get a rush out of it, but you can sure as hell bet that all this abusive bullshit is not in our own interest either. Problem is: If we do not understand our condition, we will never be able to stop that shit.

""*\[...\] But they damn well know at some level of their consciousness that they have no business being around neurotypicals, except to prey on us.* ""

You are not neurotypical. You are codependent. Even if your behaviour is not toxic for those around you, it is still psychologically fragile behaviour that needs to be changed (for your own interest).

""*So for any narcs reading this post-- and I know you're out there because I know how your kind work, that you lurk on this sub to gain information on us-- I urge you to be honest with yourselves while you still can. You may not start a relationship consciously thinking to yourself, ""Wow wouldn't it be great if I hurt this person so much that they killed themselves because of what I do to them?"" But you damn well know deep down that every relationship with you ends that way, or teeters on the brink of that outcome. So armed with that knowledge, ask yourself: Do I really want to hurt, abuse and exploit people? Or should I learn some goddamn self control, get some goddamn self respect, take some goddamn responsibility and haul my ass to therapy and be goddamn honest with my therapist so I can grow and learn healthier coping mechanisms?*""

Well I actually read the sub because I am interested in the topic.

I know now that relationships can have the tendency to turn toxic If I do not watch out. I completely agree with the rest of your statement. Narcs should learn self-control, self-respect (this is especially important) and we need to take responsibility for our actions. True. True. True. 100%.

""*Many people have said there is no hope for narcs to change. I dare you to prove them wrong, with everything that is in you.*

*For those narcs reading this and thinking to themselves, ""I like the way I am because it makes me strong, thank you very much,"" ohhh, you don't understand. In ten years, we're going to make your kind so well known and so exposed that you will have nowhere to hide. You think you're fine now because you've been able to hide your tracks in the past. Think again. In ten years, the devastating and all-encompassing effects of narcissistic abuse will be so well documented, well researched and well known that you're going to be seen the same way that racists and rapists are today. You will extricated from polite society. The jig will be up.*

*So consider that, just as racists and rapists a couple decades ago thought they could get away with abuse, you will find yourself in the same situation before long. Are you going to make the conscious decision to better yourself now, while there's still time? Or will you let all of your shame and evil deeds be exposed to the world as we mock you for being so pathetic and empty?*

*You see yourself as the hero in your story. The world knows you to be the villain. Choose your path while there is still hope*.""

I will try my best to prove that narcs have the ability to change. Narcs that think that their behaviour ""makes them strong"" literally understood nothing about their disorder. At some point in our life, we had to adapt this behaviour in order to survive, but later on in life it becomes toxic. It does not make us stronger, it makes us pathetic and miserable.

Then again, do not compare us with racists and rapists. It is not the same. No amount of anger or pain we caused will change that. We are neither ""devils"" nor ""monsters"". I know many of you feel the need to think that way in order to maintain the distance between your narc and yourself... but just because a belief helps you, does not make it true.

On the other hand, you have to take every action to protect yourself. You have every right to do so. You are allowed to protect yourself against someone whose behavior is not consciously controlled.

Its okay to distance yourself from someone who is not a monster. You do not need to believe that."

I'm realising that doing my share of the chores, cooking, parenting,etc- is only the start of how I need to change- and probably the easiest by far in the scheme of things. I can start to see that I'm emotionally dependent upon you- and that is not right or healthly. I've always taken emotionally, but never given. So I can see that I must change inside first- to untether myself from you- in terms of needing you to make me feel safe. You need to know and feel that my love and affection is there for you with no expectation from me. Most people would have learnt this through emotional development / life experience. I haven't had that- so I must do it now. I need you to know that I love you very much- and I am trying to make the mental adjustment to fully accept the fact that  I don't deserve anything in return, by a long long way. Of course the house chores are important- but they are a symptom of what is going on in my mind. No amount of cooking or cleaning will make any real difference if I haven't developed / matured inside- it will just be me doing something to get a 'reward'- and it's far far more fundamental than that. So yes, I am going to continue doing the practical stuff (which I should be doing)- but wanted you to know that (I realise) the ""REAL"" work is going to be taking place in my very soul. X"

It's most likely a big stretch, but I guess I want to see if I can completely rule it out.

1. **Are manipulative tendencies necessary to be a narcissist?** I do not have that at all; I can't imagine caring about people to the point of wanting to manipulate them, I also can't even lie and am quite peculiar about being as truthful and accurate as I can.  

2. **Does narcissistic supply need to be in real life?** I have a lot fantasies of people being amazed by my imaginary skills and so on, but I have no need for it to happen in real life. Actually I am mostly indifferent to praise in real life. I may have tendencies to subtly show off indirectly (which I am trying not to do), but any feedback does not do much and there is no difference if I don't get it. I am extremely sensitive to critisism though, one schizoid criterion I do not fit.  

3. **Does a narcissist actually have to believe they are that good or can it just be a thought pattern, while they are rationally aware the truth is different?** I keep having thoughts and feelings along the lines of ""I don't want them to do this thing, that's my thing"", ""they won't be able to do it well"", ""I hate that they are better at this than me"", but it (hopefully?) never gets acted on because I am aware that it's extremely irrational and wrong. In reality I think I am worse than other people and I feel strong hatred for myself. But it's not as straightforward as that either - except I don't think I could explain. My thinking seems to be ruled by constantly comparing myself to others and thinking about myself. I think that it is, at least partially, the clash between the untrue, idealized fantasy and reality that results in the self-hatred.

Some points I saw on the differences between schizoids and narcissists:

* *A narcissist needs people and disintegrates without them, a schizoid disintegrates around people* \- for me, the schizoid one fits 100 %, I feel I completely lose my identity when interacting with people and it is also when I experience the most depersonalization.
*  ""*The schizoid hides his need for dependency and is rather fatalistic, passive, cynical, overtly bland or vaguely mysterious. The narcissist is, in contrast, ambitious and competitive and exploits others for his dependency needs.""* \- with this one, the schizoid one fits well, the narcissist one not at all.

I also am not ambitious, have no dreams or desires for myself and I want to be left alone, not catered to. So that would all suggest that SPD is right. But I am concerned about the thought patterns, fantasies, sensitivity to criticism etc. (it's all much more pronounced than I am able to express here)... there's more. In the occasions when I do enjoy interacting with someone, it isn't about that person, it's about how they treat me and what kind of a conversation it brings me. But I am aware of the fact I can't be a friend, so even if I wanted to (which I don't), I would not engage in a friendship because it is not a moral thing for me to do and not fair to them. Could I have narcissist traits?"

IDK if I have NPD as I'm undiagnosed, self aware and probably without trauma - but I have some key, definitive traits. The most prominent is that I require attention/validation from others in order to feel good about myself and I have no internal ability to regulate my self-esteem. I also have mild grandiosity, and basically 5/9 of the DSM's symptoms.

My question is is this a core trait if NPD that all those with the disorder experience? The inability to regulate self esteem and need for attention? Is it a definitive indicator that I probably have NPD?

Side note: I may definitely be asking this question in the hopes that it gets responses and attention that I find entertaining, since right now I cant seem to get it anywhere else. If you have any easy ways to gain supply that (preferably) don't hurt others I'd love it if you shared. Thanks."

Well I don't think a person beyond 21 years old is still ""teenager"" to act narcissistic way like when you have 14\\15 years old (the age where teenagers are ""natural narcissists""). 

&#x200B;

Well I have 21 years old and have some hope of getting helped, a little bit fixed, I know its the right thing but at the same I don't want to, my true desire is to be a NPD person and I'm afraid this can change when I get older because I feel proud of being a NPD. But I know that its going to be better for this world if I get treated, well IDK, right now I'm in doubt about what should I do. 

&#x200B;

I have narcissist traits ever since I have around 6-7 years old (hard childhood, emotional abuse from dad and physical abuse from mom, I guess that's the reason) as far as I remember, I get better between my 10 and 15 years and then it returned full strenght, I don't really know why. Back then I really could feel empathy for people, mostly friends and family, because love partners I always wanted to control them and I always manipulated them, I tough back then that was love, I think I never ever loved any of the girls I dated, gez I like when they screw themselves and come to me asking for care, help, and made them get away from their friends, lots of shit this behavior did to me back then. 

&#x200B;

Around mid 19 years old to my age now (21 years old) I get a lot worse, my grandiosity daydreaming (that I always had since age of 7) incresed a lot and now this consumes significant time in my days (I thinks it became MD already). I feel like all my narc traits I had my whole life until now had just bloom all at once in max potential. I have differente narc traits along my life and now I have all of them."

9xg190,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/9xg190/the_excuses/,The Excuses,19,4,1542320996.0,"I was thinking about the excuses that I used to tell myself, and that I see crop up a lot on this sub and elsewhere whenever a narcissist is speaking or is being discussed, and I wrote this awhile ago and figured it might be useful to those here who are trying to better themselves.

Firstly, I think the most common problem is people dissociate hard from the portions of themselves that they don't like, or that other people don't like. This dissociation takes many forms:

**I get like that when I drink.** No you don't, the alcohol removes your skin-deep inhibitions and lets the real you off the chain, and apparently, people aren't too happy with the real you.

**I was just angry/sad/happy/upset/emotional when I did that.** So what? People get angry and sad and do dumb shit all the time. They're still accountable for what happens. People get road rage and smack into other cars but it's not like the police are just gonna say ""well you had road rage so it's fine."" and let you go.

**That's not the real me.** So you're some kind of evil clone?

That last one especially is a problem, because people with NPD will say ""well that's just my Narc-self, I'm working on it."" There is no Narc-self. There is only one person in your brain and that's you. And this one I feel is especially harmful because you're admitting outright that you did it, that you know you did it, but you're saying ""because I have this disorder or traits of it, I can't be held responsible"" and that's nonsense.

A good first step is to get out of this ""real/fake"" self mentality. You must be accountable, because no one else can hold you accountable for the thoughts in your head. Sound exhausting? It is, honestly. The first few weeks were some of the hardest work I've ever done without lifting a finger. But there isn't a way around this, as long as you can use any of the above excuses (and that's what they are, suffer no delusions about it) you can let yourself off the hook for anything you do wrong to other people, and if you can do that, then you have no path to recovery. Full stop.

The hard truth that you need to accept going in is that people around you don't care what you're doing, by and large. If you act an asshole, they assume you're an asshole and remove themselves from your company, as they're able. If they're bound to you by legal, professional, or blood ties, you can expect them to be working on severing those ties as soon as they're able, and never speaking to you again if they can avoid it.

So what do you do instead? Accept it. Recognize that you've done wrong, that you're not being the person that you want to be, emphasis on YOU are not being the person that YOU want to be. You've let yourself down, and likely hurt someone else in the process. So apologize. Say the words, and more importantly, mean them. And make a little mental note to do better next time.

You didn't get this way in a day and you can't stop being this way in a day. But you have to keep yourself on a short leash if you expect to make real progress.

I have been accused of being a narcissist, and I sometimes wonder if I am. I know when I'm depressed I am very self-absorbed and get sick and tired of hearing people's opinions and wish they would just be quiet. I sometimes just don't want to hear any negative stuff about me. And it always seems to happen more when I'm going through a lot of things at once that are hard to deal with. It makes me sometimes not even want to socialize. "
