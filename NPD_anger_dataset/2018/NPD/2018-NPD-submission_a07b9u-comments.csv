eaf97k4,t3_a07b9u,"Hey. I had basically the same problems. My advice:


Let it fucking go. No one is gonna care. Even If you are the next fkn Mozart or Hawkins. No. One. Cares. You will only make yourself miserable.


Just try to be your best self and do not think yourself as ""mediocre"". As soon as you start doing things because of exterior motives, its gonna go to shit. Find something that fulfills you on a deeper level, even If its cleaning toilets. Fuck it.

eafd810,t3_a07b9u,"I have this problem. In the last few years this has resulted in me doing only life survival activities, because I‚Äôm now bitter that I‚Äôm only driven to do activities for the end hoped for validation and recognition I need to quelch this toxic shame m, even only momentarily.

And I know it won‚Äôt really make me happy. Not really. So I‚Äôm bitter that I still have this desire to do, only for recognition, only to momentarily lessen shame that will not be lessened.

So I do nothing. Almost nothing at all.",t3_a07b9u
eagfbxl,t3_a07b9u,"Big time. I'm a huge perfectionist and it is crippling. I'm so afraid of ""failing"" at something that I will avoid doing it at all. And what I see as failure is not meeting my own *incredibly* high expectations. I have a degree from Cambridge but for the first few years after I graduated I would have told you I'd failed (it was a six year, double degree course, I dropped out after the third year).  I was always top of my class in whatever I did before going to uni and then suddenly I want even mediocre, I was in the bottom of my class. It fucking broke me, dude. But I started therapy and started unpacking a lot of shit that was making me miserable. That was 8 years ago and I'm still working on myself but I'm now in a place I genuinely never pictured myself reaching back then. 

I did sort of learn that there will always be someone better than you at whatever you do. That doesn't mean you shouldn't try, it just means you should only try to be better than you were yesterday. And when trying to achieve any goal remember that something is better than nothing. It's OK for something to be good rather than perfect. Hope some of that helps. Good luck üçÄ ",t3_a07b9u
eb2bcc4,t3_a07b9u,"""  When Zusya was dying, his eyes filled with tears. His students surrounded him and questioned, ‚ÄúWhy are you crying? Don‚Äôt you know that you will receive a heavenly reward:?‚Äù Zuysa responded, ‚ÄúWhen I get to next world, they are not going to ask me, why weren‚Äôt you Moses? They never expected me to be Moses. They are not going to ask me, why weren‚Äôt you Rabbi Akiba? They never expected me to be Rabbi Akiba. They are going to ask me, why weren‚Äôt you Zusya. I am crying, because I am asking myself, why wasn‚Äôt I Zusya?""",t3_a07b9u
eaj2fmq,t3_a07b9u,"You know what‚Äôs interesting? I remember being only about 6 years old and we learned about George Washington in school and that night I lay in bed and thought that if you can‚Äôt live to be someone so famous that your life will be taught to kids in school, then life isn‚Äôt worth living. This is what I‚Äôve carried with me all these years, and I never became famous, so you can imagine how disappointed I‚Äôve been with myself my entire life.",t3_a07b9u
eajf5g5,t3_a07b9u,I don‚Äôt know how to let this go I‚Äôve been great and I lost it. You‚Äôve gotta understand I‚Äôve had it all bro. Life was good.,t3_a07b9u
eaf9vk6,t1_eaf97k4,"Thanks, this is great to read.",t3_a07b9u
eafee0r,t1_eafd810,That must be excruciatingly difficult to deal with.,t3_a07b9u
eagqnio,t1_eagfbxl,"Wow, thanks, that's amazing to me. It's like no matter what you accomplish, your mind moves the goal posts back. Thanks for responding. ",t3_a07b9u
eamruic,t1_eagfbxl,This is so good.,t3_a07b9u
ec390as,t1_eb2bcc4,"Yes, I lost myself a long time ago. I have just been living a facade of a person that I put together from scratch when I was 16 or so. It is very sad, and ‚Äúnormal‚Äù people cannot relate to it at all. They think we are depressed because we can‚Äôt deal with the outside world. We are actually depressed because our inside world is non-existent. Our soul is gone. How do you explain that to other people who aren‚Äôt narcissists?",t3_a07b9u
eaj8nsc,t1_eaj2fmq,"I feel the same.

What do you feel caused you to think that way at that young age? I remember feeling insane amounts of pressure from my dad / grandfather to be successful. Like to the point where they were delusional, if you weren't automatically the CEO of a company or founding a successful start-up or going to Harvard Law and into corporate law, nothing else was worth the effort. I feel like I've avoided entry-level positions in my life because of this and never ""worked my way up"" anywhere because I always thought I was supposed to go directly to the top.",t3_a07b9u
eafexm2,t1_eafee0r,Oh yes ,t3_a07b9u
eahlzaa,t1_eagqnio,"Yup, my brain will still do it now so I have to constantly remind myself of how much better I'm doing now compared to a couple of years ago. Rather than looking at all the ways I'm not perfect. My brain is an asshole üòÑ",t3_a07b9u

ec3qput,t1_ec390as,"16? Lucky bastard! We wussed put of personhood, because we were unable to handle the same of our inadequacies.",t3_a07b9u
eajacan,t1_eaj8nsc,"It‚Äôs a good question.
I don‚Äôt know where I got that from because I don‚Äôt think my dad put a lot of pressure on me. But he was very critical and negative in general and maybe subconsciously I felt like he would only love me if I was something special. I don‚Äôt know. Maybe I was just born with narcissism. I‚Äôve always felt entitled and that I was smarter and better than everyone else (while of course also feeling extremely low self esteem and worthless anytime I didn‚Äôt live up to my or someone else‚Äôs standards).",t3_a07b9u
eahpbtq,t1_eahlzaa,Yeah me too. It sucks man.,t3_a07b9u
eajczi6,t1_eajacan,"Yeah same here. Yes that makes sense about the criticism, or not living up to his unrealistic standards. The genetic factor could be big too, like you say. ",t3_a07b9u
