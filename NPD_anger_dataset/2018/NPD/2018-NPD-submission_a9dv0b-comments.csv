Part of having a personality disorder is having needs that most people consider excessive (for attention, love, order, stimulation, etc) and that are most likely to remain unfulfilled by your environment. I really like this definition of personality disorder:

>\[...\]\[About BPD\] It helps me to think about it as a mismatch between the person’s needs and their environment - in this case another person, with their own idea of what is the “ideal” amount of closeness/intimacy. A psychotherapist may focus on helping a person change their needs/expectations in the situation, or help them modify their situation (e.g., helping them get on a common ground with the partner), leave it (new partner...).

From this thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Antipsychiatry/comments/a09mfs/personality\_disorders\_are\_the\_biggest\_bullshit\_in/eagcmmk/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Antipsychiatry/comments/a09mfs/personality_disorders_are_the_biggest_bullshit_in/eagcmmk/)

For example, being an extreme narcissist may not be a big deal for you if you're the president and you have access to all the attention, money and hoes you want (or need, if the lack of these things would make you spiral into depression).

But your average joe, checking exactly the same boxes, would do better working on improving his flexibility and neediness, if he doesn't want to be extremely miserable the rest of his life.

Complaining and ruminating about how your needs are not met, and crying and raging because your needs are not met, rarely ends in your needs being met (I don't intend to insult you with this, I'm actually talking about myself).

One has to accept eventually that their needs will never be fully met. Then you can start working into it affecting you less, finding healthier ways to fulfill them partially, etc.",t3_a9dv0b
ecika38,t3_a9dv0b,"My guess is that at your deepest core, your still not satisfied.  Honestly if you keep looking to have your needs met externally you will always be disappointed. You only seem like u need it..because deep down inside.. at your ""core"" you lack it. 

Getting better...is not and extremely hard task.. but it's doing everything opposite to how you feel and being aware of yourself before you speak and do stuff. And it's something your gonna have to practice for a while.

But you can only change for you.. if you do it for anything else ..its not gonna happen. But I do not believe NPD is a life sentence.

We can change. You can have real emotions. It's just gonna take some work... but you have to believe that you will change, that's the first step.

Your mind is the most powerful thing you have.. do not sell yourself short.

ecil9h5,t1_ecikq12,Yes it is possible. But if you dont need to get better then your good. Everyone has different needs. Everyone has different desires. But if your good well then best of everything to you!!!,t3_a9dv0b
