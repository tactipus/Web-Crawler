ebyqmi8,t3_a6uzic,"I mean, a core part of development is accepting when you're wrong about something, usually but not always behaviors, and being corrected by someone you view as an authority. Since NPD makes you both highly sensitive to criticism, to such a degree where any criticism must be so watered down and softened so as to not bruise the ego as to be meaningless, then you rarely get the opportunity to even know there are improvements to be made. And on the rare occasion you are, such improvements will be fought tooth and nail by your conscious mind due to either in regular narcissists the sense of grandiosity, or in covert narcissists, a sense of personal preservation of the self (because nothing is greater than the self, even when the self views itself as terrible.).

It's a nasty combination for sure.",t3_a6uzic

ebyqd2w,t3_a6uzic,"this is a cornerstone of NPD, isn't it?

Some narcissists are successful and flexible, but typically they are inept and do normal development only inside a narrow realm where there is little chance of meeting resistance and negligible responsibility.",t3_a6uzic
ebz3f1o,t1_ebyqmi8,"Yes I see what you mean. I defintely have that issue whereby if an authority figure or someone important in my life  (my boss, business partner, older brother, wife, etc) criticizes or gets upset with me, I just want to run away from them or I think about how they are the ones who have a problem, instead of allowing myself to take in what they said and learn to be better. I have quit so many jobs in my life and cut off so many friends, etc. because they criticized or “got upset with me” about something. ",t3_a6uzic

ec0cyzc,t1_ebyqd2w,"Arrested development is indeed the cornerstone of narcissism. Though, psychologists I’ve consulted believe such arrest can come in early mid life as well as childhood.

(Experience: 39, NPD, have been institutionalized for depression and anxiety as well.)",t3_a6uzic
