eae5n10,t3_a031kx,"I actually keep people out of my life because I know I only want what they give me.  After learning about narcissism and knowing what being raised by one does to a person, I feel obligated to stay away from relationships.  But on the other hand, I am terrified of them because I feel so worthless around people.  That, and I'm just a scared, jealous kid on the inside. ",t3_a031kx
eae5fap,t3_a031kx,yeah i feel this way all the time,t3_a031kx
eae55gq,t3_a031kx,"You know I had this realisation way later on than you, you sound pretty smart for your age (guessing because you mentioned you are still in school...)

&#x200B;

Try keeping those old friends, they are some of the best ones you will get (from my own experience)

&#x200B;

Don't expect too much from people, if you know some one is lousy at a particular thing accept that and don't rely on him/her for that and find someone else for that specific thing.

&#x200B;

E.g. you know someone who takes and never gives, learn to say no sometimes but try and be a good friend to that person when they are in need, they could help you out one day in a different way that no one else can...",t3_a031kx
eajfg90,t3_a031kx,"I feel like everyone is catching on to my behavior, and I’m sometimes paranoid that there’s a rumor going around. Ive stopped hanging out with my friends completely in case they’re just conspiring against me because of it. It’s completely illogical, but fuck it.",t3_a031kx
eaebirh,t1_eae5n10,"In the last 3-5 yrs I've had a lot of growth. I also have been able to look at things objectively and realize the things I do more than ever. Because of this I too felt it was better to just stay away from people and especially women. 

Any engaging with women will eventually get me to the point where I just tell them straight up. I burn my own supply because I don't want to be dishonest about who I am and what I want. 

Just ended a 5 yr relationship with a woman that showed me so many things. I once again got self destructive and cut ties. So yeah I'm lonely too but at this point I ask myself, I'm 38 by the way, how do I have anything resembling a heathy relationship. Really trying to figure things out. 

There are days when I tell myself that I need to be alone and not to indulge but those other days I need a supply and my mind completely changes. ",t3_a031kx

eaecier,t1_eaebirh,"Yup i completely understand the changing mind part.  Its as if your whole outlook and who you are changes.  Like there's hope for your connection to humanity, and hope for a life of some happiness.  But then you're reminded that you're different, that any new relationship isn't going to work out and you need to be honest with yourself... at least those are the thoughts i have on a daily-weekly basis.  

I think that flip flop of perspective comes from the fact that narcissism is a defense.  Narcissists are made from faulty trust early on, and are always prepared, aware of it or not, to have an out in a relationship in order to protect their ego.  They CANT be truly vulnerable so they set booby traps to remain safe.  when relationships fail, it shows where the trap was set to protect a vulnerable area.

edjstzv,t1_eaebirh,"Question,  would it be helpful for you if your supply stayed and asserted boundaries? Could it ever be beneficial (in a sense of becoming less narcissistic) for your supply to be a friend that offered you non judgmental feedback?",t3_a031kx
eae8fop,t1_eae6jhw,"I do it because I don't feel right using people, even though i want to and need to.  We aren't real people.  We're a disease but nobody understands that.  So I try to do my best.  I don't think im good at hiding either.  and you say it gets better with age.  If i may ask, how old are you?",t3_a031kx
eaebm44,t1_eae6jhw,I hope it is and from my personal accounts it's appearing to be so,t3_a031kx
eaec3az,t1_eae64qr,I related to a lot of that!! ,t3_a031kx
eaed0z0,t1_eaecier,"Absolutely.. just now at 38 am I starting to recall those little snarky remarks that unsettled my SO. things that just fly off my tounge without though. 

As far as traps and vulnerability I've had people try to crush my ego.. at the time it hurt but guess what.. my ideologys changed to support a less connected relationship.. 

I have a ton of self confidence and when women would try to shit on me, admittedly because I was shitting on them in some way or another (being figurative :) just for the record) I would just make a new rule to live by so that I could carry on. 

I feel very empty at the moment as I don't see progress in the future.. at this point in my life I just don't have the energy(at least right now) to engage with anyone.. even if it means not getting a supply.  Couple of women gave me numbers and it wasn't easy enough so I put them on the burner.. if they come around great if not no worries..  I have a hard time finding a stable mindset.. I wish I wouldn't flip flop from trying to be caring to being a complete selfish prick!! ",t3_a031kx
eaed704,t1_eaecier,"I'm just speaking from personal experience, but i think the flip-flop happens because the reality that I am nothing but a helpless baby surrounded by booby traps is too much for me to bear.  I try to act like an adult, i surround myself with cardboard cutouts of what i would like to be.  But they're just covering the booby traps.  

My emotional reality tells me that I'm hopeless to find love.  I don't want to feel hopeless.  So watching all the life happen before my eyes makes me sad enough to lie to myself that I am in fact a real person with healthy, mature emotions and boundaries, capable of giving love.  So I fool myself, away from the harsh reality, and try to build a happy one that is easier to live with.  But the  problem is, it will never hold up in the long term.  When someone tests me, they find a booby trap protecting a baby.  So i guess we want to change, and want to fit in.  We just dont have the tools... and dont want the tools",t3_a031kx
edjt6qv,t1_edjstzv,"My ex was very strong. She out up with a lot and I believe it's because of her love for me. I feel if she stayed and set boundaries it would cause me to eventually self destruct. I'm a free spirit and so feel like my soul is imprisoned otherwise. 

As for the non judgemental feedback, I would take it in stride. When I hurt her and would not communicate with her for days or weeks I would argue with myself against myself. So one side for her and one side for me. As for a friend I would simply take said criticism, internalize it and then process it until I came up with a decision.  At this point in my life I don't know how to have heathy romantic relationships. ",t3_a031kx
eae9145,t1_eae8fop,I'm also really upset because i'm newly aware.  and I realize that i got here because my Narc dad got into a relationship with my mom.  so i'm kind of soured on relationships.  Plus I'm not a good faker so i cant be who i feel I'm not.  ,t3_a031kx

edjtobi,t1_edjt6qv,"Interesting.  Well I just discovered my best friend who I am in love with and says is also in love with me , is most likely a covert narc. I asked the question because I am considering it may be beneficial for me to continue with at least friendship to learn why I attract narcs (coda), and help him learn about himself as well- rather then me going NC just to end up with a possibly much more exploitative and volatile narc. He trusts me and told me he uses people and hes tired of it and didnt want to date me because it would end in me hating him. I feel like his self awareness is high enough and my ability to take it as a non judgemental learning experience could create an environment where we both grow in recover. 

Sorry this was long, I'd just really appreciate hearing a narc perspective on this",t3_a031kx
eaeamfa,t1_eae9jxq,"I'm 25, uh oh haha.  I think you'd have to be a prodigy to be aware in you're earlier years... but maybe you were.  

I only like using people that i have know for a while.  I've realized how full of bs i am and making new friends, or interacting with people whom i dont know is next to impossible because I dont have a self from which to interact.  Everything about me is made up to accommodate my environment, or to somehow shore up my appearance.  Its all so fake: my hobbies, preferences, values.  There is nothing real about me as a stand alone person.  But yeah, i dont want anyone to see me in a bad light either.  because if my family or 1 to 2 friends saw me like that, id really be fucked.

Your spelling hints are really shitty because they're all essentially ""remember the fucking spelling of the fucking word"".

eaeg6zl,t1_eaefjme,"I don't think it is healthy for us to live in seclusion however I'm trying to train myself to not need people as much as I did when I was younger for supply.. 

One of the things that's help me is listening to Alan watts and Terrance McKenna.. McKenna has a lecture about not being afraid to go at it(life) alone.. just try to listen to those principals and see where it gets me.. every day is a day to get better but some days I don't..

edjtv8v,t1_edjtobi,"Well.. I would say you have to monitor him while you do this.. it's essentially a science project in a way.. you are to collect data and always be on your toes. 

Does he play mind games? 
Does he treat you well? 
How long do you feel that would last? 
What do you wish to gain from the relationship? Long term? Do you want to fix/save him? 
How will you deal with it if he indeed makes you hate him?

eaed24b,t1_eaed1ru,"Hey BooCMB, just a quick heads up:
The spelling hints really aren't as shitty as you think, the 'one lot' actually helped me learn and remember as a non-native english speaker.

They're not *completely* useless. Most of them are. Still, don't bully somebody for trying to help.

Also, remember that these spambots will continue until yours stops. Do the right thing, for the community. Yes I'm holding Reddit for hostage here.

Oh, and while I do agree with you little feedback loop -creating comment, and I do think some of the useless advide should be removed and should just show the correction, I still don't support flaming somebody over trying to help, shittily or not.

Now we have a chain of at least 4 bots if you don't include AutoMod removing the last one in every sub! It continues!

Also also also also also

Have a nice day!",t3_a031kx
edju3yi,t1_edjtv8v,"Yeah I agree, obviously it would only help him to the extent and willingness to be honest with himself and then me . But either way it will help me in teaching myself to have strong boundaries with someone that I would normally allow to use me. And even that will help him in the sense that if I dont allow him to use me, he can feel good about having a friendship in which he doesnt use the other person (even if the only reason is because I'm not allowing it ) if that makes sense. No, I don't think I can fix or save him. But its possible that my presence and non judgemental support can act as a mirror in which he can fix himself.  If I dont allow myself to be used , then there will be no reason for hate. Again very strong boundaries will have to be implemented. But for one reason or the other, he has alot of trust when it comes to me psychoanalyzing him. Maybe because I was subconsciously aware of the gradual  emotional manipulation and so in most of our interactions I did my best to keep emotions out of it, which allowed him to Express himself freely.
