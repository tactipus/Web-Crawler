ecsmtcw,t3_aajme8,"First, don't make them self aware. This is the worst thing you can do to them. I know I have npd and it's terrible knowing that you are emotionally dumb and don't understand things. Deep inside they know, they have issues, don't highlight them. 

If your friend has good enough success and people around him to care for, then don't worry, he'll live it out. If he's depressed, then give him a shoulder as a brother. Give him confidence and trust. It's a black hole of emotions, we narcissists live in. Just make sure, he is confident and not confused anytime. He may unintentionally hurt you or not understand simple emotions. We don't know basic stuff, so as a friend, be kind on him. But since it's a dark personality, be aware of any emotional damage they may give to you. ",t3_aajme8
