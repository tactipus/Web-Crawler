eakj1cc,t3_a0qqaw,"When I was a teenager I would say I lacked a ""basic human faculty"" but I could not put my finger on what it was. I didn't feel badly about it. Almost took a bit of pride in it, felt different, apart from ""the herd"" as I saw it.

 I know now it is much more complex than lacking a given faculty or even several. But, yeah.",t3_a0qqaw
eajzmev,t3_a0qqaw,"Sure, that's why most of us crave stimulation, isnt it? Being alone with the void is scary",t3_a0qqaw
eamqkyy,t3_a0qqaw,"Unfortunately, I've been so Narcissistic my whole life that I've held myself in such high regard, & have considered myself practically perfect through most of it.

It's only been through constant fights with my SO and terrible consequences of my bad choices (made especially bad due to my delusions of grandeur) hitting me hard that have helped me see the reality of my inner nature.

I'm now (somewhat) aware of what a trash person I am. Though at the same time my NPD (as some sort of flawed defense mechanism) convinces me that at the same time I'm so much better than most people. Toxic duality.",t3_a0qqaw
eakk4av,t3_a0qqaw,I probably started to realize it in late jr. high/early high school when others started to sort of “get” things about the world and people that I didn’t. I always chalked it up to me being a little immature and I’d start to understand things eventually. I’ll be 24 in a couple months and I’m still grasping at what I’m missing.,t3_a0qqaw
eal38ed,t3_a0qqaw,"I always though I was depressed. I was very quick to start with suicidal ideation whenever things weren't going my way. But several therapists and psychiatrists (yes, several because I'm a nightmare patient) have told me that I don't qualify for depression.",t3_a0qqaw
ealv96j,t3_a0qqaw,"I always had that spoiled rich boy vibe, like there was something slightly off. My girlfriends always knew I was happy and financially taken care of and I had that rich boy charm, but there was also something missing inside too. That’s what people saw. But I was also happy a lot of the time, so no one could put a finger on it. I always acted like a rapper, flexing all the designer. And I did it because I could, I did always make a lot of money in and after 10th grade.",t3_a0qqaw
eaknqgx,t1_eakj1cc,Yeah that’s kind of me too. I felt different and kind of empty but kind of assumed/told myself that I felt different because I was superior in some way. ,t3_a0qqaw
eamqqcy,t1_eakj1cc,"Wow, well said. I've spent most of my life feeling the same way.",t3_a0qqaw
eaku6jn,t1_eajzmev,For sure. The void is the worst and it’s nice to have a word for it now cause that’s exactly what it is. Are you able to be by yourself/ deal with not having fully engrossing stimulation and tolerate it now? I’m getting better at it slowly. ,t3_a0qqaw
eanlrf4,t1_eamqkyy,"Yeah I feel like a defense mechanism is a good way of putting it. Like it’s effective in defending you but it also defends you from like, idk connecting all the way with ppl the way other ppl do or something? Have things gotten better with your SO since you have gotten more aware (if you are still with them) ",t3_a0qqaw
eaxk943,t1_eamqkyy,"I just failed at the best relationship I've had. She was wonderful and strong and genuine. Once I realized I had done it yet again I started devaluing myself and began to proclaim that I was a loser and a bum. It doesn't bring me down as I just accept it at a neutral statement. 

But then I have my proficient side. I'm highly competent. In whatever position I've been in I've done fairly well against others. 

On one end I know I can never be a part of that realm. That i have to float around like a ghost and then of course I console myself because I am better then them anyway.  

I've been diagnosed since I was 21. I'm 38 now and I'm just realizing I'll never have anything special to hold onto and if I do I'll just destroy it.  ",t3_a0qqaw
ealimqg,t1_eakk4av,It’s hard to figure out what you’re missing and even harder because it’s so intangible that it feels impossible to describe to anyone or even to yourself. That’s how I feel anyways ,t3_a0qqaw

eb29jfv,t1_eal38ed,Same. I like you!,t3_a0qqaw
eakv3hx,t1_eaku6jn,"I'm somewhat of a ""borderline Narcissist"", I'm not officially diagnosed with NPD and I don't fully meet the criteria (maybe I do for a NOS diagnosis, that is my suspicion at least), however I have undeniable high Narcissistic traits and defense mechanisms, as well as terrible self esteem regulation.

For that reason, I'm capable of being on my own at times, but without stimulation/something to capture my attention I very quickly become extremely bored, angry and frustrated. I realise there is nothing I can do to amuse myself and that my ""mask"" is, well a mask. My self-esteem gradually drops without external validation/stimulation until it is basically non-existent.

Can I tolerate it? Yeah, sort of. All things must pass. I usually just accept that I'm in a bad mood and go out and find a source of supply/validation/attention to rectify that. If I don't get something to put me out of the bad mood I get really poor motivation, which gets even lower If I am criticised/invalidated by others (in my perception). But I'm slowly learning techniques to deal with it, which is good.

Good luck to you. I hope you become even better at tolerating being alone in the future. I know it's difficult.",t3_a0qqaw
eb29msr,t1_eaxk943,"I'm fucking tired of this ""heroic solitude"" bullshit, from my part. I want to be a functional human. Please try not believing in it!",t3_a0qqaw
eam9fwy,t1_ealimqg,I hear you. It doesn’t make a lot of sense to others. I’ve always thought I was reading into things too much until I looked around at the large number of surface level friendships I’ve made through the years relative to my very few long term deep friendships.,t3_a0qqaw
eama7ud,t1_ealvi6z,"For the most part, yeah. As long as the girl doesn’t know how shallow I can be or is pretty insecure herself I’ve always been pretty charming and confident but afraid of commitment unless she is seemingly perfect. If she starts to sense that I’m a fraud and am insecure myself, gameover. ",t3_a0qqaw
eakvmlf,t1_eakv3hx,"Thanks for your response. 

“My self-esteem gradually drops without external validation/stimulation until it is basically non-existent.” That nails the feeling. When nothing is propping me up, I’m at such a low.

Yeah I am not diagnosed either - have been therapy for other issues for years and now looking back im realizing a lot of what I have been dealing with/treating were my narcissistic tendencies (smart of my therapist to never use the N word lol) but I’m more self aware about regulating my mood now tho it’s still hard.

The void for me tho feels less angry and bored and more, self sabotaging/depressed, suicidal ideation. It’s weird how quickly the shift to that mind set happens for me when I get away from external validation. I know il be okay again when I get back with other ppl but it’s hard to see that from in the dark place. 

I def want to learn to be alone better tho cause we can’t go our whole lives just avoiding that and finding supply (well I guess we could but I don’t want to lol)

What techniques?",t3_a0qqaw
eanm6g9,t1_eam9fwy,"Yeah! I had so many surface friends too and now that I have some more real, deeper friendships I’m like wow this is so different and I didn’t know what was lacking. My friendships weren’t really dramatic or anything even but I could spend so much time with someone and manage to share very little of myself and stay pretty removed from that person. Was always acting a little",t3_a0qqaw
eakwcs5,t1_eakvmlf,"I applaud your level of self-awareness. Not a lot of people would come to independently (or even semi-independently) realise that their defense mechanisms are both Narcissistic and harmful to their health. I'm the same, I'm in therapy currently and I specifically mentioned to the guy that I wanted to work on my NPD traits, as I realised he probably wouldn't focus on them as much otherwise (despite specifically calling me ""antagonistic"" in a report, basically therapist talk for Narcissism).

I never get suicidal ideation for some reason, though I can relate to the depression. It mostly manifests as apathy and a feeling of pointlessness in me, though. I used to self sabotage, but I've made conscious efforts to try and overcome it. It doesn't always work but it can be improved with practice/mindset retraining.

I agree, we're all going to be alone at some point. Might as well learn the best ways to deal with it now, as a way to prepare for the worst",t3_a0qqaw
