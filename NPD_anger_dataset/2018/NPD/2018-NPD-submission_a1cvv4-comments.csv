eap03iy,t3_a1cvv4,"You seem way too self reflective to be an actual narcissist just saying. Have you actually actively manipulated and hurt other people? I used to think I was a narc when I started out and then realised I was furthest from, the conditioning just made me believe I was. ",t3_a1cvv4
eapro96,t3_a1cvv4,I'm near 100% certain I've been a Narcissist ever since childhood. My mother's also completely pathologically Narcissistic.,t3_a1cvv4
ebaqqg6,t3_a1cvv4,"I think it's a combination for me.

Both of my parents have pretty clear cluster-B issues. 

When I was a kid, the loftiest aspirations were encouraged, and at the same time, my own interests and personality were frowned on. It might have been deeper than that--I think I sensed that \*who I was\* was just a path to suffering, at home and elsewhere, and that I had to be something else entirely.

Then during adolescence, I decided after a series of experiences that I could never trust anyone or count on anyone. And it seems like that worldview just snowballed. ",t3_a1cvv4
eaoqq4x,t3_a1cvv4,"I feel like I was always a certain way, and I saw differences between myself and others at points. I think I had opportunities to be different, but I always stayed the same, and that is unique in its own way.",t3_a1cvv4
eapzfi2,t1_eap03iy,"Totally. Yeah I know I don’t have NPD just some N tendencies and I have an N Dad - if this makes sense I feel like I was mimicking his behaviors which shaped my world view and I acted like a narcissist, could only see ppl as something to use, until I became aware of it all therapy which was pretty early on and it’s still a struggle. I have struggled with having no sense of self and feeling a “void” and always needing an objective /stimulus which is an experience I have only found others talking about in this group. 

It’s almost like there is a narcissist inside of me trying to tell me what to do and I’m able to tell it to be quiet before I act out usually but it’s there causing pain. I credit that to early therapy.",t3_a1cvv4
ebbazpm,t1_eapro96,I wonder how often ppl struggle with NPD without also having a narcissistic parent ,t3_a1cvv4
ebzcrtk,t1_ebaqqg6,"That rings true for me too. I think my dad was narcisstic and I also was very hyper aware of peoples feelings and always felt like there was danger lurking everywhere, especially with my parents marriage and relationship always on unstable ground. At a very young age I felt a need to be very important and make some major mark on the world, I guess because I didn’t feel valued at home. My dad defintely didn’t put his wife and kids first and he was like a child - very needy and insecure and could be emotionally abusive.",t3_a1cvv4
