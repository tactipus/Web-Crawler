e9r6658,t1_e9qmxbp,"Note: Details about the other person are only included to give you some background. My real question is this: Was I really selfish in this case? I really felt helpless and powerless, so I don't know how it could be.

I know I can be selfish sometimes, but I think that this person who is supposed to be a minister really was being too hard on me. I confronted him about this after feeling accused by him of choosing my dog over my significant other who is in a care home.

I'll try to explain:

His family at first assured me I would see my S.O. in the home anytime I want then all of the sudden I couldn't see him. This triggered me to tell his sister she had ""no right to judge"" if certain things my significant other said about her were true. It is a pretty serious issue, and I did what I could about it. I checked into the process of finding a lawyer and so on but because we didn't actually have a ""state marriage license"" I couldn't find anyone to take my case. 

And I hope you don't delete this next part:

 It's not with the intention of starting a religious discussion -- just stating details of why my significant other and me were considered ""married"" by this minister -- so please no opinions about this aspect of it. I only included it to help you understand the minister's perspective and why he called me a ""narcissist.""

I at first chose this minister for counsel because he believes in the original Constitutional and scriptural marriages, which I agreed with. However, I questioned this stand after my spouse started to lose his memory.

Anyway, I feel helpless because I never got a state marriage license, and tried to find out what I can do about still being in my S.O.'s life.

And this summer, I was working like mad to come up with money in case I would have to take his sister to court. But then all of the sudden, I had an issue with my dog that cost me money. And this was just days before his hearing. 

I took this ad well as the fact that I couldn't find a lawyer as a sign that I should just wait a while and just take care of myself for the time being (things kept,coming up that would stop me from being able to take action -- mostly stuff that cost money, and I barely had enough to pay rent.)

I went to this minister for counsel and prayer, and when revealing my situation, he asked me, ""you chose your dog over your spouse?""

I told him ""no"" and that I felt wrongfully accused and that I didn't understand why he would ask me such ""strange questions"" he asks me and that I don't understand why he's being so hard on me. 

Before he had a chance to respond, I told him that I guess ""strange"" is a strong word.  I know one mistake I made is adding the word ""strange.""

But anyway, I was accused of being a narcissist after this and of blaming everyone else for my problems and so on when all I thought I was doing was pointing out how I felt when he asked me that question.

There are other details such as he is on sabbatical until a custody battle is finished, so I questioned whether he was projecting some of his issues on me.

There were other words, then he blocked me.

What made him block me I think is ""sometimes it is not always apparent what the right thing is to do the second I ask (name of higher power), and if you can't accept that, then we have nothing left to talk about.""

After that is when he brought up ""narcissism"" -- and I know this thread is not supposed to be about whether or not he is the narcissist, but I ended up admitting, ""that's funny because that's what I thought you were"" and explained all the reasons why.

Now, I only brought all this up to give you a little background because yeah I think I have some narcissistic/selfish tendencies but don't think I am a narcissist.

And I don't think I chose my dog over my spouse. The dog was still at the house, The spouse was not. And it wasn't my choice to be 100% cut out of his life, nor will I ever think that is nrcessary. 

I'm now trying to find a home for the dog because my circumstances changed as to me realizing it is the right thing to do. But when  I was still at our old place, I thought I was going to keep this dog who had been in our lives for more than a year (was a family dog we took on). 

I had an immediate responsibility I couldn't ignore. Does that make me selfish in this case?

e9ps5sb,t1_e9ppk65,"Okay somebody must have deleted his post before I saw it. I am not sure what I'm asking for. Not a diagnosis. I was just accused of being a narc today because I was admitting hurt feelings about feeling wrongfully accused and having someone being too hard on me, but sometimes, I can be too argumentative.
