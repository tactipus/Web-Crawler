e9vg02d,t3_9xu6w8,"Look into r/cptsd, I find most people who talk about PD's only focus on the symptoms and managing them and never get to the root of things. It's a defense mechanism though, you didn't willingly choose to give up on the world this way. Working on the root cause is painful, hard and scary but your brain has plasticity, you can change :) one thing though, don't believe your mind, it will twist things any chance it will get, focus on the emotions, real emotions, the ones you feel in your body (this can be hard if you weren't allowed to as a kid and a lot of the emotions will be from that time) good luck :) don't give up, trust me, the world of being vulnerable and having emotions feels scary but it's even better than the fantasies, it's real ",t3_9xu6w8
