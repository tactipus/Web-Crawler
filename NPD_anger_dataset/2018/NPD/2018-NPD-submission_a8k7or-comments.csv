ecbe1mn,t3_a8k7or,"take a low dose and get some experience. LSD is not for everyone. If the bad outweighs the good, just don't take LSD.

in any case: low dose and get some experience. Don't jump into the sea of lava when you can first practice in a pool of water.

LSD is in fact a very dangerous substance. The worst of all of them. Your worry is entirely justified. Plus, in the end, you will just turn into an extraterrestrial vegetable with no connection to stuff that matters. Sometimes a hallucination is just a hallucination. I wanted to be an astronaut too when I was 6 years old.

Worry is good. Worry is your recognition of real danger. You already learned one lesson.

Personality disorders often have impulsiveness as a feature. Impulsiveness is not good if you are high on acid. Choose a setting where it is under control and then with time you can learn to tone it down. Following an impulse may sound like a good idea at first, but on acid it barely ever is. You need steady flow and self control. Acid will teach you, but it won't just make it happen. You'll be running into some walls before you have learned.",t3_a8k7or
ecujewk,t3_a8k7or,"They're finally starting up experiments again for using psychedelics for various psych issues. I know it's shown amazing progress for depression and PTSD. They're mostly being done in larger cities, https://maps.org, to see if there's one near you. ",t3_a8k7or

I took lSD 8 times total and it caused my rapid cycling bipolar to kick in (not having a real relationships with my relatives I didn't know that there are other cases of bipolar in my family)",t3_a8k7or

egds9eb,t3_a8k7or,"Shrooms was very odd I ""saw"" myself in the mirror. I even for awhile changed who I was But my ego and anti social self came back and shrooms and all psychedelics are useless to me. I just recently tried to capture what I had before, I ate 10 grams of shrooms but nothing much but mild visuals happened. I now stay away from all drugs except what i'm prescribed. ",t3_a8k7or

ecflqwy,t1_ecfl63j,"We drank a lot and smoked a lot of pot first and then took the acid (assuming it was legit/good acid I can’t be sure). I think that was part of the problem - I shouldn’t have gotten drunk and smoked pot first I don’t think. Actually pot usually makes me nervous and paranoid. 

I didn’t hallucinate, but at one point I felt a feeling like there were 2 sides of my personality and they were coming face to face and was being forced to confront myself. But I resisted it and eventually it passed. I was too afraid to confront it. It was an awful and scary experience. Afterwards I felt very depressed thinking about it, and of course I did - and do - wish I had had the courage to face it. 

This was about 30 years ago. I never did LSD or any other psychadelics again. I also don’t smoke pot anymore, other than once or twice a few hits over the years. ",t3_a8k7or
