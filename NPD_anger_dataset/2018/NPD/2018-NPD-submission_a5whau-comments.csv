It's been 8 years without being abusive. I still have personality issues to work through, and I can still be insensitive or hurtful from time to time, but I notice it immediately, retract and don't let it escalate to abuse.

I think just fearing that the cycle of abuse starts again will make you feel a powerless puppet of your moods, but you aren't. Monitor your emotions constantly, notice the steps you go through when going from A to B, and come up with plans for every step to prevent the situation from escalating. If you slip up, notice fast and go back to the plan. No need to be afraid when you have a plan. Remember that you can always remove yourself from a situation before resorting to abuse. You can say something like ""I think I'm not in a good place right now and I need to calm down, can we talk about this later?"". You can write down why what happened hurt you, how you feel tempted to react, which may be the point of view of your partner, how do you think that would be the ideal way of resolving the issue without anyone getting hurt...

Remember that there are alternatives to violence to express rage. If you understand where your rage is coming from, state your issue in a calm and sincere way, and propose reasonable solutions, there's a much higher chance that your partner will listen to you.

If you're anything like me, you're going to have to be careful when the end of the honeymoon phase comes. You can't count on it to last forever. It's easy to be good when you're feeling good, not so easy when something happens that triggers you. At some point the other person may say something that hurts you or behave in ways you don't want. Then you may feel like you've fallen out of love with them, or that they're trying to hurt you on purpose and that you're only defending yourself. It's important that you're prepared to cognitively navigate that, just be very aware that how you're feeling it's not going to last forever, and that if you act on your feelings you'll regret it later. Make the compromise to treat your partner right, and honor this compromise even when you feel like you're being mistreated by them or that you've fallen out of love with them. You can't control what others do and how that sits with you. But you can control what you do.

Keep figuring yourself out. Keep doing the diary thing, try mindfulness practice, read books about narcissism and IPV. Do things for yourself that stimulate your well-being and emotional stability, such as doing exercise, eating healthy, meditating, hanging out with friends, going for walks in the park. Expand your support network beyond your partner, get a therapist if you can.

Your partner should probably be looking into ways of protecting themselves too. I recommend the book ""Disarming the narcissist"" from Dr Wendy Behary. It's one of the few books for victims of narcissistic abuse that isn't all about ""RUN FROM THESE MONSTERS"".",t3_a5whau

I used to worry about this, too. However it has been 2 years since I started working seriously on myself/these traits and I can honestly say in that time that while I have made many many many mistakes (I make them every day), not once did I revert to something worse \*or even as bad as\* the way I was before I started working on myself. Hope that helps you, some.

PS ""I thought that I was about to lose everything that mattered to me."" I hope this doesn't just mean your partner because as long as a single other human being is your primary source for validation you will be fucked.",t3_a5whau
