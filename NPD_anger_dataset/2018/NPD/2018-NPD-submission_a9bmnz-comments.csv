ecieq3r,t3_a9bmnz,"This is a known issue with NPD : in order to keep your facade intact, you have to delete or twist the memories that endanger it. It's a defense mechanism. I'd advise to keep a journal to keep track of what happened in the day so you can come back to it if you have doubts, that can help.",t3_a9bmnz
ecickl0,t3_a9bmnz,"My memory is shit. I barely remember anything from my childhood. From there on I only remember very generic facts, like ""I was living in X"" or ""I was dating Y"", and maybe two or three emotionally loaded events per year. I never recall people's faces or names unless they're very close to me, sometimes I can keep confusing someone's name or face even after months of knowing them.

The only thing I have good memory for it's to keep scores with people, lol.

Lately my short-term memory has been terrible too. I ask the same questions to the same people twice in a row because I forget I did. I constantly forget where I parked my car. I'm told to do maybe four things and I completely forget about two of them. I have trouble keeping conversations because I forget words. I think it may be that I'm just depressed or anxious which can affect short-term memory, but honestly, it's got so bad that I'm worried it may be something more serious.

I don't know if any of this has to do with NPD though, but I saw once a video where two narcissism experts discussed that it was common for narcissist to have very few memories from their childhood: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEgyzgpq92I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEgyzgpq92I)",t3_a9bmnz
ecl71fk,t3_a9bmnz,"Yes, my memory is horrible. I had no idea this was an NPD thing until recently but it makes sense that it is part of a defense mechanism. I forget all sorts of things and am constantly being reminded by others. I forget things I say. I ask people the same questions multiple times. Sometimes I have to feign or lie to cover up what I don't remember but should, and I don't like having to do that.

As a tag-along to this my sense of time is so completely warped it is insane. Things that happened years ago feel like they were a few months ago. Even some things from childhood. Time seems like it goes by at about 2x the normal rate i.e. a month feels like about 2 weeks to me. I retain very little of what I experience, even emotionally poignant experiences. I totally forget people. I feel like there are whole stretches missing from my life maybe.",t3_a9bmnz
ecifu0l,t3_a9bmnz,I don’t remember much about a lot of my childhood. I can barely remember my mother even. High school pretty much nothing. And even the things I remember are more like it was someone else’s life that I witnessed. I believe this comes from surpressing ones life prior to creating a new fake personality. Everything prior to that becomes unreal in ones memory.,t3_a9bmnz
ecpmf0i,t3_a9bmnz,"This, so much. I can barely remember anything that people seem to remember about me, even if it was within the past month. I seem to wake up every week reinventing myself. It's a toxic cycle that I want to break but I don't know how.",t3_a9bmnz
ed38jr9,t3_a9bmnz,Yes. I only remember about one third of my life up to this point. The things I do remember don't even seem like memories. I feel like I'm recounting a movie. Never considered that it could be an NPD issue though. Interesting.,t3_a9bmnz
