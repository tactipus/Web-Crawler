eaq5jsh,t3_a1ieo3,"Can I suggest going to check out the blog of a guy named HG Tudor ""Knowing the Nariccist"" if you want to understand where people like that are getting their information about narcissists.

I suspect he is a very high-functioning person with ASPD but he is doling out all this advice and ""knowledge"" about how to deal with narcissists. Really, the way he describes himself and the way he describes the so-called narcissists he writes about, it's obvious he's talking about people with ASPD of varying degrees.",t3_a1ieo3
eb2g27y,t3_a1ieo3,"> It might sound silly, but: Narcissism and Codependency have a lot in common...

This is not silly at all and completely accurate. It has been clearly shown in books such as The Human Magnet Syndrome by Rosenberg that narcs and codeps are two sides of the same coin and engage into what Vaknin calls a ""dance macabre"".

Codeps and narcs have the same wounds but grew up to survive using different defense mechanisms. 

In essence, narcs and codeps are each other's mirrors.

Take an intimate scenario for example: 

I don't believe narcs enter a new relationship with the intention of destroying the other. On the contrary, I think narcs get completely infatuated with their shinny new object. 

It is an immature and superficial emotion but nonetheless, very intense all the same. I think the narc views each new conquest as ""The One"" who will finally manage to fill their empty bucket. The codep is originally seen as ""perfect"" and promptly put on a pedestal. 

The narc, lacking a core self, will admire the qualities of their partner, and try to vampirise these, acquiring them through some sort of osmosis. 

This is all magical thinking of course and the narc is soon hit with the devastating realization that the codep isn't the perfect imagined extension, but instead a flawed human being with wants and needs. This, to the narc, is disgusting and unacceptable.  

The ideal reflection is shattered and destructive devaluation ensues. 

On the other side of the equation, we have the codeps who essentially fall in love with themselves through the reflection of their own qualities.

Everything is fine in la la land until the codeps start unveiling their needs for recognition and reciprocity. This development unleashes ""The Monster Narc"". A big shock to the system that brings a lot of confusion but also the slow realization that the relationship functions as a one way street: The narc takes without giving anything back. 

The loss of that perfect partner sends the codep running in the crazy hamster wheel, constantly trying to recapture the fantasy of the early days.

We know the drill and it never ends well because both narcs and codeps are immature and unrealistic in their expectations of the other.  

Rosenberg renamed codependency ""Self-Love Deficit"". Pathological narcissism should be renamed something similar because both seek love and validation through the eyes of the other instead of working at nurturing their own. 

I believe codependents can achieve a level of self maturity and build solid foundations for themselves through hard introspective work. 

Although narcissism works on a spectrum and those with traits can aspire at bettering themselves, I sadly view true NPDs (especially malignant ones) as shattered selves with zero chance of improvement.  ",t3_a1ieo3
