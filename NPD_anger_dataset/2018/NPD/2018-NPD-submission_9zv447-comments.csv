eaclfc8,t3_9zv447,"It is possible to change. Find a therapist and *be honest with them.*

Tell them when you snap, tell them what you like and don't like about yourself. Tell them what you really think. Tell them what you want to change. 

I'm finishing my psych degree now and we spent a lot of time on NPD. There is a lot of debate in the psych community about a narcissists ability to change. Many think it's possible, others do not. I'm speaking from personal experience when I tell you it is possible. The most important thing is that you are honest with your therapist, it's the only way they can find a path that is right for you. Even if the truth is ugly, they are trained to handle and understand it.

It's hard, really hard and you're going to fall and have to pick yourself up but it's worth it. ",t3_9zv447
eacn2sx,t3_9zv447,"I see the irony clearly. It’s like fighting cancer with chemotherapy instead of changing bad habits, right? Well, from my point of view, it’s almost impossible to step outside of a toxic situation when you are the target. It hurts your ego and destroys your pride. People become bitter from abuse. Although, I do recognise some people are just used to being petty, because it actually works. Usually pettiness is the narcs way to shift the blame. In German we say: “The best defense is to attack.” 
As we all know, narcissism is a spectrum and it’s different from an actual NPD. 
If narcs would mind to explain NPD a little more and on the other hand “victims” would be ready to think outside the box, we would have a better understanding of what NPD is really like. That’s why I support this sub. People here are apparently well regulated. I hope it’s just a matter of time until society stops bashing pwNPD and starts providing actual help. But hey, selling books and making blogs about NPD is a huge goldmine since research has just started. Everybody can give their 2 cents without being concerned about creating more drama and damage. In my opinion, this fact only reinforces the narcissistic environment we live in.

You can change! Everybody can! We just need to suffer enough until we recognise that we need to. These are only MY 2 CENTS!",t3_9zv447
eacycsp,t3_9zv447,"I personally think that all of the people with BPD who come here to brigade and bash everyone with NPD are a large part of this issue.   Especially for traits that are the same, if not worse in their case.  There should be rule banning them just because their page is set up as such.",t3_9zv447
eaclw6o,t3_9zv447,"""having a bad day"" is different than the pervasive lifelong pattern of treating other people like objects, lacking empathy, being totally delusional and grandiose and striking out with rage at the drop of a hat. Perhaps you are mistaking narcissistic traits for actual NPD. You are expecting empathy when (if you truly have NPD) you don't have it yourself.  Anyone else see the irony here? ",t3_9zv447
eadrgv7,t3_9zv447,"I am no expert and probably have mistakes in my perceptions feel free to add or correct. 


The original American school of thought is that it is not treatable, because there is no magic pill and many resist change.  

Treatment is possible for those who wish but it takes time and willingness. 

When the bond between two persons is spouses, it’s difficult to advocate for change if the person does not want change. 


My not always correct advice, if relatives, advocate for change. 

If spouses, unless both are on the same page leave. ",t3_9zv447

ecd1vz4,t3_9zv447,"I completely agree with you. I’ve been thinking of writing a self help book about narcissistic traits, although I’ve not been diagnosed with the disorder myself, I certainly have some high traits of NPD. What do you think? I’m not a professional.",t3_9zv447
eglbktf,t1_eaclfc8,"It is untreatable if there is no reason to change. This is truest thing about NP.

But when anyone with NPD realizes, that they do have a big reason to learn and tweak their NP: because **it makes them unaware and chases away people who could otherwise benefit them** in the long run. Knowing this any high functioning NP person would be more than happy to upgrade his knowledge.

Side effect of this is also less collateral damage to other people, but this never was and never will be of concern to an actual NP person, so it does not count as a motivation at all.",t3_9zv447
