Everyone has a degree of narcissism to them.  Its part of the human condition.  I think it becomes unhealthy when a person lacks of care or concern of ones own actions and/or how they affect others. When one is indifferent to the suffering that is/maybe  caused to others as long as their own needs are satisfied that is where things start to look toxic in my humble opinion.
