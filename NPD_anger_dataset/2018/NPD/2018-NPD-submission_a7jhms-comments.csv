ec3ige2,t3_a7jhms,"Id find my own narcissism too annoying

In a weird way though I think I am dating the female version of myself and itâ€™s a real pain in the ass",t3_a7jhms
ec3uwkd,t3_a7jhms,"Hell no. Im a terrible person. The lies, manipulating, and emotional abuse ive put people through in the past (getting help now) have been me, in a relationship. 


I would say absolutely yes to me in a relationship, before the splitting and devaluing begins. Im actually quite loveable until then. But then it turns bad, real bad.",t3_a7jhms
ec3w10e,t3_a7jhms,"Not at all. In fact my ideal man is quite the opposite of me: attentive, submissive, selfless, kind, honest, stable, reliable, etc.

In fact a common exchange between my boyfriend and me is:

\- Heck, how would you feel if I said that to you / behaved like you just did?

\- Well, I wouldn't be dating someone like me in first place.

I do share the difficulty committing, but I never thought it was because I hadn't found my a guy who was exactly like me. I called it ""the blank canvas syndrome"". I was more interested in fantasizing about a better uncertain future than in the person I had beside me.

ec40np4,t1_ec3uwkd,"when does it (splitting/de-valuing) start for you? do you notice a specific point? or triggers? how does it feel to you? I have done the same and am trying to change and identify patterns/pattern points. sigh,",t3_a7jhms
ec43ive,t1_ec40np4,"For me, its either when i start seeing flaws or weakness in them or i feel like theyve done something to bruise the ego. Sometimes both.


Its almost always after about a year. My last relationship it was about 2 years in. This one was a little less than a year.


When it starts happening, its like i go numb. I dont care about them anymore. I dont care what they do, say, how they are day to day. I dont care. Unfortunately, in the past (not so distant past too), i got off on staying with these people and treating them like.... Less than human. Gaslighting was my favorite. I would set them up, so they would fail, and belittle them, and watch them cry. Over and over again. For fun.


Thank hell ive realized this, because i was absolutely disgusting (behind closed doors of course). The thing that made me see me, was smoking weed. It was horrifying REALLY seeing myself. And seeing the bf sit next to me, with nothing but love in his eyes. It was therapy time. They said bpd, reluctantly. So i went with it. After several more sessions of me being completely honest, npd was handed to me. The therapist stopped seeing me. So its me, weed, my very loving patient bf and a lot of self help books, unpacking my lifetime of destructive baggage.


Id say you really have to be mindful of your thoughts. When i start breaking the rules ive made for *them* is for me, a tell tale sign. Also you know the little irritating things people do? That usually are just irritating, thats it? When those become bigger and multiply.

ec4fcze,t1_ec4czpu,"Yeah you read that right. Small town logic. Very closed minded 'round here. Oh well. Their loss. I couldve been tons of fun! Kidding.

Guess its you me 'n mr.weedy.


Are you seeing a therapist? How long have you known youre basically the scum of the earth, like me? :)
 ",t3_a7jhms
ec4i83z,t1_ec4fcze,"Wow. Honestly wish it WERE small town logic, but most therapists feel that way, small town or no. One of my biggest gripes is the amount of sympathy BPD gets but NPD does not, despite both being Cluster B and both having so many co-morbid symptoms. Like BPD people will threaten to kill themselves if you leave. Super common thing they do. That is \*easily\* as emotionally abusive as anything any of us has done, I'd bet.

Anyway, I first learned about NPD as even a thing that exists in the world when I was maybe 14/15 years old. Basically every single one of the diagnostic criteria applied to me, at that time. Felt chronically ""different"" before then but had no labels except ""arrogant"" and ""selfish"" and things like that. No notion of a disorder with a medical delineation, before that.

I got pretty into drugs/partying as a young adult, so that numbed any effort to deal with or tackle my NPD in any way for a good decade (sigh). I have been working on it actively for 2 years now (and also clean from all substances except marijuana, which I do feel is medicinal on more levels than I can list here).

I do group therapy once a week which I find helps me a lot. I wish I could do more, but my schedule is ridiculous. I can't really do individual therapy because I will literally spend the entire time trying to manipulate/charm/entertain/seduce the therapist and that is not productive. It's like paying money to lie to someone. No, thanks. I have to do that enough for free.

How's coping going for you, thus far? Any headway?
