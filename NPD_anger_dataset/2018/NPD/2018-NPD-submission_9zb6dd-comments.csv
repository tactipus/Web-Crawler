ea93qo2,t3_9zb6dd,"My issues with money were that my sense of self-confidence was directly tied to my bank account. When I was broke, I felt like I couldn't do anything, talk to anyone, fell good about myself, etc. When I had a few grand just lying around as bullshitting money, I felt like I was the greatest man alive.   
Fortunately I've moved past that, but it was a very serious issue for a long time. Narcs are all about signalling competence and significance, money is the easiest way to signal that. I'm sure most of us have some sort of hang-up about money or spending.",t3_9zb6dd
ea8toen,t3_9zb6dd,"I don't freak out about money, but that's the problem, I do blow everything in impulsive stuff or just showing off. Being the center of attention everywhere can be expensive as fuck, and a serious issue since I don't really make a lot, my business is small, sometimes I make less than some of my employees.",t3_9zb6dd

easd3jl,t3_9zb6dd,"More than I read about your thoughts and more I found myself in them.

Then I think ther must be a difference, between my way of thinking about the reality and the way other people think about the (same) reality.

In the end, at the age of 51, I found myself while I'm speaking with others, about very simple things, how they behave with those things. 

It's like a was a child of 12 just yesterday, and today I have to learn how to handle my money, how to behave with others, how to think about my life.

I do it, but I'm unsure if it is sufficient to get over the limits of my mind.",t3_9zb6dd
ea9r7vy,t1_ea93qo2,"Well said. I was like that too... if I had a good amount of cash in the bank I was “happy”. If I, I felt depressed and worried that I would be living on the street at any time, even though there was no reason t feel that way.",t3_9zb6dd

easd8zy,t1_easd3jl,"You may have not had good examples growing up of how to handle money. My father was a gambler. Likely I inherited some of his issues genetically, as well as learned them.",t3_9zb6dd
easeiqc,t1_easd8zy,"In effect my father was not so good at managing money (somewhat near to a gambler on how easy he had been on taking decisions about its business).

His ""lessons"" did not make me growing up very well. But why I did not recognized them as bad lessons, during my life?

My short anser is that I suffered for the lack of attention by my mother and her aggressiveness. So I enclosed myself into a private world. I stoped to grow up and I started to pretend I was adult. But I was not, for real.",t3_9zb6dd
