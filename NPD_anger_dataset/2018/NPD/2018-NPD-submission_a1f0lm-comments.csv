eaqeuhk,t3_a1f0lm,"Read this post from [/u/TheMightyEggplant](https://www.reddit.com/u/TheMightyEggplant), it has lots of good advice: [https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/9kaqfi/im\_a\_narcissist\_that\_wants\_to\_change\_looking\_for/e6z45z4/](https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/9kaqfi/im_a_narcissist_that_wants_to_change_looking_for/e6z45z4/) 

Here are a couple articles of self-help for people with NPD for two particular situations (devaluation and rage):

About the retaliation thing... I've noticed that most of my moods are temporary so I just try to isolate myself until the worst has passed. My boyfriend knows when I'm in a ""don't talk to me right now"" mood and leaves me alone.

Usually I'm eventually able to talk about what's disturbing me in a calm way (maybe after two or three days and after writing my feelings down) and we talk about it relatively calmly. If I feel understood and cherished during the talk it usually passes and we have a few good days.

If something is bugs me so much that I'm not able to calm down for a long time I'd consider leaving the relationship. I'd rather leave than mistreat someone. I've noticed that most of the time chronic problems in my relationships are due to disappointments that I'm just not able to live with. The abuse happens when I try to mold that person into what I need him to be through punishment and manipulation. But it's not moral to try to change someone. If I can't accept them as they are I have to leave.",t3_a1f0lm
eapp81o,t3_a1f0lm,"You can't elevate her to your level, that's insane. If she has empathy, she can't be like you or on your level. Not really.

You're obviously concerned about the way you treat her, so you're going to need to get some therapy - good therapy - if you want to change. If you don't want to change, don't bother. You'll just be wasting your time and the therapist's time.

If you don't have empathy, you likely never will. You just need to learn ways of understanding what that means and how you can live the kind of life you want to live while accepting that you are who you are.",t3_a1f0lm
eargsvn,t1_eaqeuhk,"Thanks for this material, it's really good!

I don't know about changing people not being moral. If I'm helping them through difficulties or saving their life by changing their mind, is that not moral? I think, though, I have stepped over the line when I'm pushing something for myself and I hurt them - clearly not good.

Yeah, some things I just can't accept - inflexibility may be my real problem. I usually try to negotiate their words, behavior or beliefs to accommodate my sensitivity. I try to do it without much fuss and with their cooperation.",t3_a1f0lm
eaprf2g,t1_eapp81o,"Haha yeah, OP's whole post was very reasonable until the 'elevater her to my level' part. Made me laugh, because it's such a stereotypical grandiose narc thought. (No offense meant).",t3_a1f0lm
earh7l8,t1_eapp81o,"I have been in therapy for this and related issues for 13 years and really do want to change. I have changed a lot, but the core is still there, lack of empathy and inflexibility of belief and hot button issues (like my health). I have tried to ""exercise"" my emotions and now I express them more frequently, albeit awkwardly.

I just want to be able to treat her like an equal so she doesn't always feel like I look down on her. She's been very patient and loving.",t3_a1f0lm
eav5yl6,t1_eargsvn,"You're welcome!

I just think that there are very few instances when manipulating or pushing a person to change could be justified, and even then, in my experience it usually doesn't turn out very well.

Trying to change a person to fit our standards when there's nothing wrong with them is obviously subjecting a person to pain for selfish reasons.

And by thinking we know what's best for that person better than themselves (we're talking about functional adults) we are being patronizing.

I just offer my opinion to the other person and that's about it, sometimes time proves me right and sometimes it doesn't. Forcing change creates resentment and breaks trust (people have started hiding part of themselves from me in the past for being too judgmental, but they didn't really change). People internalize stuff better when they reach a conclusion on their own.",t3_a1f0lm
eaprsd6,t1_eaprf2g,"It's laughable because, unless he's dating a fellow narc, it's just not possible.",t3_a1f0lm
eaqq8v0,t1_eaprf2g,What does this even mean? Is OP a cyborg or something?,t3_a1f0lm
eas8jm7,t1_earh7l8,"Well like I already said, you're going to have to find a therapist who deals specifically with these issues - have you tried cognitive behavioural therapy?

Accept that you may never be able to have or feel full on empathy - but you may be able to learn how to respond more appropriately. 

As for viewing her as an equal - just that sentence alone is proof of your narcissism and will require therapy in order to determine why it is you don't see her as an equal and help understanding that she is your equal, if that is indeed one of your goals.",t3_a1f0lm
earg8zo,t1_eaqq8v0,"Haha, I wish. I meant elevate her in my mind to an equal or higher level of importance, so we could be equals and a more balanced and proper couple.",t3_a1f0lm
eatj52p,t1_earg8zo,"Aaah, the the ability to conceptualise some others as whole valid proper conscious beings. I struggle with that too. I notice that my irritability by people, comes i a significant part from the externalisation of the tension caused by my own pretty fucking harsh self-judgements. The rest is from being genuinely irritated by others' behaviour, with touches of a personalised take on classism. 

(Multiple separate sources have characterised me as an anime villain.)",t3_a1f0lm
