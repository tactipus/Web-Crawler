ea5lzue,t3_9z19lp,"I almost never outright lie but I can unconsciously omit details that make me look bad or exaggerate details that make me look good. The only way I deal with it is, being very aware of this tendency and taking it into account as I talk. It sometimes slips out though.",t3_9z19lp
ea5n819,t3_9z19lp,Yeah compulsive lying is a thing. You ghave to be conscious about it. If you don’t want to be like that you have to admit to others that you lied. It’s hard and scary but it will bring piece to your life. Also I don’t think you have NPD so probably post fir another sub.,t3_9z19lp
ea5l89k,t3_9z19lp,"Yep, totally in the same boat, I lie so much about stupid little things that I can't remember what the truth is any more. Worse, I seem to have accidentally made a career out of it by shading the truth so finely I always look good, even though I have no idea what I'm doing and should be fired. ",t3_9z19lp

ea5p53z,t1_ea5p1ns,"It is indicitiva of NPD and many more conditions,  but the fact that you feel discomfort towards your own behaviour means you’re probably not NPD, perhaps just few narcisistic traits. Narcissist does not feel that something is wrong with him, rather something is wrong with everyone else except him. ",t3_9z19lp
enqtg0s,t1_ea5p53z,"Well, it's only discomfort from thinking that other people will see me in a negative way. Like, I don't want past friends or acquaintances to hear my name and think, ""Oh, fuck that guy"".",t3_9z19lp
