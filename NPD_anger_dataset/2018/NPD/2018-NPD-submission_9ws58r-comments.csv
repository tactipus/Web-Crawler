Narcissists exhibit core codependent symptoms of shame, denial, control, dependency (unconscious), and dysfunctional communication and boundaries, all leading to intimacy problems. One study showed a significant correlation between narcissism and codependency, but while most narcissists can be classified as codependent, the reverse isn’t true – most codependents aren’t narcissists. They don’t exhibit common traits of exploitation, entitlement, and lack of empathy.

Codependency is a disorder of a “lost self.” Codependents have lost their connection to their innate self. Instead, their thinking and behavior revolve around a person, substance, or process. Narcissists also suffer from a lack of connection to their true self. In its place, they identify their ideal self and are obsessed with projecting that ideal self out into the world. 

Their inner deprivation and lack connection to their real self makes them dependent on others for validation. Consequently, like other codependents, their self-image, thinking, and behavior are other-oriented in order to stabilize and validate their self-esteem and fragile ego.",t3_9ws58r
e9n7e6p,t3_9ws58r,"You can be both NPD and Codependent. My ex was both and so was his mother. I was confused because some people think that you can't be both, but you can. As our marriage counselor put it:  

> Codependency is a disorder in and of itself, it is not based in a reaction to another's dysfunction but rather a lost sense of self in another person, place or thing, it stems from very low self esteem.  Narcissism and codependency are not mutually exclusive, often times a narcissist will flip back and forth from complete self absorption to complete lost sense of self making relationship almost impossible.

  I don't know what you're looking for. The fact that you are even attempting to improve yourself bodes well because most NPDs refuse to admit there is anything wrong, so nothing can ever get fixed/improved.

e9sj47t,t1_e9n7e6p,Thanks! I was honestly just curious if those traits seemed as iconic as they seem to me to those with actual experience with narcs. I appreciate your response.,t3_9ws58r
