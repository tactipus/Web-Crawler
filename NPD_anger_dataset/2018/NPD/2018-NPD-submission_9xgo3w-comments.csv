e9sufj6,t3_9xgo3w,"There are a lot of narcissists on this board, but not all. There are people who actually know what you're feeling. Who can empathize wih you. Who know they can show you the same love they have for themselves because we all exist in each other. Because if I could say these words to myself so long ago, if I could just reach that person... 

The truth is your boyfriend would never say these things to you. Youre coming here because you can't go to him for the emotional sustenance you need. The answer is no. Five years from now its no. There may be a gesture of acqueisence, an attempt for change. You may see improvement, but it'll be you who changes long before he does. 

You probably already have...

Every high you have, every year that passes by where it becomes easier to tolerate... Isn't him changing, its you. Ten years no. Twenty meh. You won't be who you are today. Perhaps then No as an answer won't be a big deal. Maybe you'll have a family and be miserable but have children that can help remind you what a human being looks like. But they too will be under the rule and influence of a narcissist, and may even become one themselves. 

Nothing that I'm saying will be popular, I'll take the down votes, it isn't hopeful because I don't want to give you an answer that just might seed in your head that you have the power to change this person for the better. You are not that person for them. You are already in the danger zone because you are trying to fix them. You are the hand trying to unplug them, and you think they are going to see you as a friend...  Your love, the love you feel inside of them, exists in you. That's why they need you in the first place. What you love is you, those feelings within you. What they love is that love you have inside of you. They can't see what you see when you look into their eyes. You have to ask yourself, how willing are you to say goodbye to all the parts of you that he fell in love with in the first place just to make it work... and when its all gone and you've shifted to match him, when all that you are is made to fit, do you really think he'll even want you to? 

I'm sorry, I'm truly, truly sorry. There are those who should, if you will it, have the opportunity to get to build memories with you, that a narcissist would be fit to forget. You deserve honest memories. You deserve to be happy. I want nothing less for you, than the best. 

You have something inside of you, so beautiful, it can attract a narcissist. You are that valuable. Don't let it be taken from you. Please.",t3_9xgo3w

ea5kzrg,t3_9xgo3w,"I wrote this post on relationships with narcissists, maybe it will help you: [https://www.reddit.com/r/narcissism/comments/9t27do/is\_it\_possible\_to\_have\_a\_healthy\_relationship/e8wq523/](https://www.reddit.com/r/narcissism/comments/9t27do/is_it_possible_to_have_a_healthy_relationship/e8wq523/)

The key here I think is that you're not looking to get along better with the narcissist but expecting him to change. Expecting another person to change, and a narcissist on top of that, is rarely a good strategy, because it's out of your control. I think this article that advises to manage your expectations about the relationship or leave is spot on (my post was along the same lines): [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/insight-is-2020/201404/i-love-narcissist-now-what](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/insight-is-2020/201404/i-love-narcissist-now-what)

It seems like his symptoms distress you immensely. I wouldn't even think to stay with a narcissist who at least wasn't self-aware and who wasn't actively trying to change. And even those are a handful.

Narcissists can change, but most of the time they do it only looking to alleviate their own pain or due to harsh corrective life experiences, never prompted by empathy or compassion for a loved one. The most transformative experience I had was being abandoned by everyone I loved. It was agony but it made me realize that nobody would ever accept me the way I was.",t3_9xgo3w
e9ste92,t3_9xgo3w,"There can be happy relationships with npd, only for the first little bit if they are able to put on a charming mask. Then our true self starts to show a bit. Its ugly, not happy.

 We might build you up so you can look forward to those moments. Only when its necessary to keep you in our grips though. Stick with us for the long term and we will try to control you because we are deeply insecure on the inside. We end up making it our goal to make you our bitch whether we want to at first or not. You will be miserable when we feel we the need to make you that way for whatever reason there is. Or maybe even when were angry as well. 

 You will end up being brought up and built down in a position where you are subtly abused and in some cases directly abused. So if you want all of that then go for it. Some people crave a relationship like that and we need people like you. 

In all seriousness Op please call him your ex bf and move on from him. You know thats the right move you dont need reddit to tell you that. Thats also is whether he's self aware or not.",t3_9xgo3w

This is the truth. It happens so slowly that you aren't aware it is happening. Eventually you'll be a shell of a person and they will say ""you changed"". You can't ""fix"" them, and the chances of them fixing themselves are slim. Maybe when they realize they have close to no one in their life, they will want to change., or maybe they will blame everyone else. You will eventually know better than to bring up topics that could upset them. You will eventually know better to bring up concerns because concerns about them are ""criticisms"" and anything that hurts their ego sets you up for attack. Extremely defensive individuals. 

These individuals are incapable of unconditional love. Unconditional love does not exist when someone engages in splitting. Their love is given when you are meeting their emotional needs/demands. The moment you have needs or feelings, they won't listen. These individuals are mostly empty, they try to fill it with whatever they can get ( sex, porn, alcohol, drugs, etc).

ecb0iyr,t1_ea5kzrg,"I think it's reasonable to expect change in the face of conflict and pain. If I kept slamming the door at night in a house full of people, it'd be reasonable that I eventually change my behavior. It wouldn't even require more than someone waking and asking me. 

I may do it out of habit for some time, and there may be further inquiry. but I believe it's completely within the realm of expect, that it shouldn't be necessary, once I am aware of the negative effect it's having on others. When it slams, and it most likely will, I should wince, and feel a sense of shame, or I would make a note, to avoid it in the future. 

In my specific case, and I've seen others do it, I'd open the door again for the sole paradoxical purpose of closing it, properly. Just to show myself it's not only something I should do, but because it really makes sense. That change can improve me. 

I think we should expect this in people, though I know nothing of this sort being true, it's my belief that the lack of this expectation in young behavior is among that which facilitates these individuals to exist in the first place.",t3_9xgo3w
