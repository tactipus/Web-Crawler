ebx6tr7,t3_a6qwjq,"I recommend somatic experiencing touch therapy to address your childhood trauma. You have the money to seek out this therapy, and it will go a long way towards helping you in the long run. Also see a psychologist who specializes in personality disorders and discuss your concerns with them.",t3_a6qwjq
ebxmw0d,t3_a6qwjq,"Thanks for sharing all of this, really. I’m a lot older than you and have also done a lot of terrible shit and caused a lot of suffering to people. I also missed out on healthy adolescent sexuality due to my father exposing me to huge amounts of pornography starting when I was a young kid. I’ve also been obsessed with making and keeping money (my father was also a big time gambler and used to take me to the horse races when I was a kid) and often put it above relationships with people. I even once didn’t take my dog (who I and my kids loved dearly and deeply) to the vet after it got hit by a car because I didn’t want to get a huge bill (which I could have still easily afforded) and rationalized that maybe she couldn’t be saved anyway. Fortunately my kids weren’t there so they don’t know the truth and think she just died from the accident and couldn’t be saved. 

Unlike you, I’ve made but also lost a lot of money due to sabotaging things, gambling and wanting short term gain. I have only about 1 friend left in my life. I get depressed all the time thinking about all the things I did and didn’t, all the people (and dog) I caused pain to, all the good things and people I threw away due to impulsivity or selfishness or stinginess.  

My wife has surprisingly put up with me for nearly 20 years but I don’t know how much more she will. My kids are amazingly seemingly fairly well-adjusted because their mother is very well-adjusted and I am able to hide my issues from them and be a halfway ok dad to them (except my older son I had out of wedlock with a different woman 20 some years ago who is failrly fucked up and doesn’t even speak to me anymore).

I think about suicide all the time, but know it will cause more problems to my family then good. I am trapped in the realization that I have been - and am - a  pretty horrible, insignificant, selfish and weak person who has probably caused a lot more suffering than happiness in the world and now I am in my 50’s and don’t see much hope of ever changing or becoming better or successful. 

It is just getting harder and harder to see light at the end of the tunnel. In fact, I feel like I will ultimately destroy and lose everything and end up alone and miserable unless I make some drastic change and I don’t know what that is. I’ve been to psychiatrists, therapists, tried different meds, etc throughout my life, but they only help temporarily and I always fall back to the me that I know and am.

Anyway, at least you are still young and have time to turn things around. Good luck and I hope your life will be better then mine is by the time you hit your 50’s.",t3_a6qwjq

ebzpvr3,t3_a6qwjq,"Hey, so,

Before you deal with the substance abuse, you cannot deal with your emotional/psychological problems. You have to get sober first, as shitty as that is. I did uppers and psychedelics (including research chemicals like the 2c family and DMT) in adolescence and then was a needle junkie for 5 years doing opiates. I cannot tell you the things this did to aggravate my Narc symptoms. 

The process of getting sober (for me, doing 12 step work in an HA \[Heroin Anonymous\] program is what I chose) also helped generally with character development and my Narc traits. Good luck. ",t3_a6qwjq
ebx8dhw,t1_ebx6tr7,"I'm so afraid of confronting what happened to me and reliving it, from the molestation/rape and at home verbal and physical abuse... I'm going to read into it but it sounds terrifying at face value... But if its the only way I must move forward. I will have to see my local options, thank you so much for the feedback. 

I know it's almost impossible to say but does it sound like NPD? Not enough info to say? I just want to be told I'm a piece of shit instead, but I have no empathy at all nor guilt",t3_a6qwjq
eby3akt,t1_ebxmw0d,"Thank you for this reply. As a computer savvy kid with many free aol trial discs, I was able to expose myself to neverending porn, and have also been addicted to that my entire life except for periods of opiate use as it destroys sex drive. My memory is hazy but I think I was doing some fucked up stuff, and as a child was communicating with and exchanging pictures with at least one adult woman.. I also feel the same way about the light at the end of the tunnel and the bleakness of it all, as I've been aware of these problems of mine for a few months, even started reading some books, but nothing changes and I can't get out of my horrible habits. I as well am almost certain when I dissolve my company and my fiance leaves me, I will be totally alone. I have a very strong aversion to starting another SSRI so I really, really hope therapy can be the answer. It seems like a neverending curse for me, I get through a difficult childhood and highschool, battle with drugs the rest of my life, and now at the end of it all I'm a broken person who must strive to even possibly be ""normal.""

ebxaqfi,t1_ebx8dhw,"Well I definitely can not diagnose you. But you have definitely been through childhood trauma, whether it’s NPD or not. 

You do not need to rush in to trauma processing. You will probably want to do ground work before that anyway. You can start with the somatic experiencing touch therapist and psychology expert, but you do not need to jump into the childhood stuff. The professionals know how to go slowly with you.

It is really great that you have developed self awareness. That is the most crucial and biggest first step. Now that you are thinking about this, you will never be able to not think it. So now all you can do is push forward. You already can’t go back or ignore this. ",t3_a6qwjq
ebxgwfh,t1_ebx8dhw,"Only a professional can tell you if it is NPD. You also may have histrionic PD or Borderline PD, which are often link to sexual abuse/molestation. But it doesn’t seem that you are completely devoid of guilt. You have realized your flaws and gone I too self-reflection. 

You didn’t choose to have these coping mechanisms. Theses are response to your abuse, and your behaviors allowed you to survive your childhood. ",t3_a6qwjq
eby7mnq,t1_eby3akt,"If you find something that helps, let us know. I was on lamictal for a while and it made me feel more normal and content, but after a while I started feeling “numb” inside and tapered off it. I’ve done this a few times and I even if I promise myself I will stay on meds forever, I don’t think I will. And when you get off them, it can have bad side affects - like for me, I would get very impulsive and do stupid shit. I am really trying to not get back on meds. 

I know everyone says this, but excercise is probably the most effective thing for me to not get too depressed. If I play tennis or basketball and get a really good work out, It definitely keeps me feeling pretty content. I find when I don’t do it for a few days, I sink back to depression. It’s not a cure for your entire personality, but it least it keeps your mind and emotions in a positive place.",t3_a6qwjq
eby1vfd,t1_ebxaqfi,"I seriously appreciate the info, thank you. I'm going to see what my options are Monday and try to get in somewhere asap. I'll be sure to update with what I find out.",t3_a6qwjq
