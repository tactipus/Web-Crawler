ebfb384,t3_a4k5eb,"I don't know exactly how to help you, but your post reminded me of something I read about flexibility being the a cornerstone trait of a healthy personality. 

While the article doesn't explain how to train flexibility, it defines it and highlights the benefits of being flexible. Maybe it will help understand yourself better and serve as a little motivation to keep looking in that direction: [https://www.mentalhelp.net/articles/flexibility-the-key-to-a-healthy-personality/](https://www.mentalhelp.net/articles/flexibility-the-key-to-a-healthy-personality/)

It also says that rigidity of thought is a consequence of deficient mentalization which is common among people with personality disorders and it creates a lot personality problems besides lack of flexibility: [https://www.mentalhelp.net/articles/attachment-theory-expanded-mentalization/](https://www.mentalhelp.net/articles/attachment-theory-expanded-mentalization/)

They recommend Mentalization Based Therapy: [https://www.mentalhelp.net/articles/mentalization-based-treatment-mbt-for-personality-disorders/](https://www.mentalhelp.net/articles/mentalization-based-treatment-mbt-for-personality-disorders/)",t3_a4k5eb
ebfaoqo,t3_a4k5eb,I don't think there's anything wrong with not conforming. As long as you're not using or hurting people. ,t3_a4k5eb
eby1mj0,t3_a4k5eb,"I can totally relate. I’m in my 50’s and since I was a kid I’ve always rebelled and tried to be different than everyone else. I’ve  made a lot of bad decisions and wouldn’t heed others advice, and now I realize the decisions were based on being impulsive, emotional or trying to prove to my family and others that I was capable and smart and talented enough to make it own my own, in my own way. And I understand about the shame aspect of it. I think because I was ashamed and embarrassed for being a fake person, I tried to make up for it by showing that I was better and smarter than everyone else. And, as a narc, I felt what good would being successful be if it was done in the same old way as other people did it? I had to be special and unique all the time. Of course after decades, I’ve come to understand that I am just fucked up and couldn’t deal with the normal ways of doing things, so I tried to escape.",t3_a4k5eb

ebfemuc,t1_ebfbfbm,"Well, it seems to me that you learn from your mistakes, at least sort of. You seem to have learned that being stubborn it's not an optimal way to go through life, and that the cause of your stubbornness seems to be some type of internalized shame, because it embarrasses you to be found out to be wrong (which is actually a pretty normal thing, and not this terrible tragedy).

Shame is the bane of us narcissists. An emotion so unbearable that we go incredible lengths in order to avoid it (and sometimes, bringing even more shame into us in the process for example, stubbornly insisting on something even in the face of irrefutable proof that it's not so, making a fool of ourselves). Not only we feel shame stronger than anyone else, but also for things that aren't even shameful in the first place. 

It seems to me that your need to avoid shame is making you unable to reflect on your mistakes, making you focus too much on proving others wrong instead of using whatever method is best for pursuing your goals, even if you have to tweak your approach several times and accept criticism. 

One of the principles of mindfulness is to look at reality (and yourself) as it is without judging it or trying to change it, as if you were a scientist trying to figure out a new species. Distancing yourself from your emotions in this way helps immensely to figure yourself out without feeling much shame.

I'm trying to rise my tolerance to shame by exposing myself to it more often little by little. Doing things in public I know I'm not good at, admitting defects and failures, etc. Far from looking weak, I often find that the people who can laugh at themselves seem to be the more resilient.",t3_a4k5eb
ebfbchy,t1_ebfb4uk,Did your parents accept you for who you were as a child? Or did you have to fight against what they wanted as well?,t3_a4k5eb

ebfbxms,t1_ebfbm4a,"Your parents should have supported you and loved you for who you were. It's not your fault that you grew stubborn and kept doing things your way even if it hurt you. 

I noticed that you do MDMA a lot. Next time you should do it alone, and instead of sharing your love with other people, try to go inside into your past and give love to yourself. Talk to the child inside that wasn't supported by your parents. You will see there is lots of pain but the MDMA will make it very easy to feel it and release it. ",t3_a4k5eb
