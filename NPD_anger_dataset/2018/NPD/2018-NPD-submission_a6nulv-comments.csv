ecwxst6,t3_a6nulv,"I don't know what you mean by a common group. I can't say we hate each other. Well, at least I don't. I love being around narcissists who know what they are, have made peace with it and know how to enjoy themselves. The back and forth is fun. There have been times when it becomes a game of who can damage whose ego more but I enjoy that as well. I like mind games.",t3_a6nulv
