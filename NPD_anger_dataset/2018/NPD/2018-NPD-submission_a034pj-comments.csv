eaew1fo,t3_a034pj,"Great post, it brought something quite new to the table. There is actually a crossover for SPD and NPD. Here’s a link basically confirming much of what you’ve said.

Many people on this sub may have Schizoid Personality Disorder, comorbidly as well.",t3_a034pj
eamrimr,t3_a034pj,"I'm Narcissistic and Schizotypal, so it may be you have aspects of both Personality Disorders. I'll give my experience, with regards to your numbered questions\~

I can relate to much of what you say. I don't require validation from others, only from my own mind (and I always deep down feel superior). I also simultaneously know I'm trash and think I'm superior (I've learnt I'm trash through real life consequences of my bad actions, and yet still feel superior due to some kind of narcissistic defense mechanism).

I feel that I'm not usually intentionally manipulative, as I'm so delusional that I believe my own lies most of the time (and will fight to the point of immense suffering to maintain my delusional sense of being right).

I need people, but only one other close person is necessary (probably due to my introverted, Schizotypal nature).

I'm very ambitious, but my toxic personality/Bipolar makes my life a trainwreck of missed opportunities, and it tears me apart.

Schizotypals  and Schizoids have quite a bit of overlap in traits as well. You sound like you're probably on both the Narcissistic and Schizoid spectrum to me, but that's just speculation.",t3_a034pj
eahvi59,t1_eaew1fo,Thank you for this link. Great ! ,t3_a034pj
eaijeee,t1_eaew1fo,"Thank you. That is actually the very article that got me thinking about all of this a month or two ago. Unfortunately I don't understand it much. My initial thoughts based on one of the paragraphs were that I could have been wrong about being a schizoid and was just a narcissist who chose to act like a schizoid. But now I don't think that adds up.

On the other hand, narcissism is in the Guntrip criteria for SPD. Or maybe what I described is how narcissism would manifest in someone who is primarily a schizoid (not dependent on other people, very internal). But I don't know if any of this works like that.",t3_a034pj
eaqt4vo,t1_eamrimr,"Thank you for the input. It does seem that if anything, SPD still remains in the mix. My difficulty enjoying things or being interested in anything definitely runs much deeper than not being good at them and the strong need for solitude as well. My only ambition in life is to get my own place and not leave my room or talk to any people unless necessary.",t3_a034pj
