ec6asx4,t3_a7nk6p,"I have found that when people display certain character traits or behaviours, that I share and that I dislike about myself, it makes me instantly dislike that person, almost to the point of disgust. 


I think it's a case of spotting what we perceive to be weaknesses in ourselves. Things like being vulnerable and needing to be taken care of. I think it's partly because we find it very difficult to ask for our needs to be met so when we are struggling we just do it alone. Maybe you resent your partner for being able to do these things and therefore get the support that you always wished you had? A sort of ""No one ever looked after me so why should I have to look after them??""  reaction. 


The thing to remember is that you are deserving of care and should have received it, the fact that you didn't is not your fault. Be the person you wish had been there in those times. Trust that your partner will return the care, rather than just take it and use it to manipulate you. A big part of coping with NPD is learning to trust people, giving them the benefit of the doubt rather than waiting for them to fuck you over. This is very much more easily said than done but I've found therapy to be incredibly helpful. Things can get better and I hope they do for you. ",t3_a7nk6p

Except I actually did split and that ended.",t3_a7nk6p

Good luck to you, again ",t3_a7nk6p
