eas2mhc,t3_a1ovw5,"To be honest there are few things that I would put effort into if they had no repercussion on what people think of me. I'd probably still enjoy things that give pleasure while taking no effort such as watching tv, playing videogames, eating junk food, masturbating, getting high or drunk, etc.",t3_a1ovw5

Like set. Nothing would ever matter forever and I’d just be gone forever.",t3_a1ovw5

eh3lr72,t3_a1ovw5,"Predators love human interaction. Victims of psychopaths tend to withdrawal and shut down because of the anxiety they get from the gaslighting rituals they’re abused with. They’re made to look like the psychopath and the liar, user, ice cold one, and wolf in sheep’s clothing. I’ve been through it before and am actually going through it right now. To start your journey of empathy try putting yourself in that situation and try to feel what a person going through that would feel. I always try to take on other people’s perspectives. It’s healthy.
