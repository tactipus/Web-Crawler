eankg0r,t3_a12re2,"I realized that some months ago.
Stopping my old habits of producing lies (for myself and for everybody in the planet) made me optimist for the future.
I'm 50 and my life starts today.
Not too bad to me.

good luck my friend",t3_a12re2

eap8j2j,t3_a12re2,"Hi  Silesyan,

I'm 37 and I recently realized I'm a covert narcissist too. I'm also looking for help. However, it sounds like you are in a very hard and dangerous place. I want you to know that some people know what you are feeling. They all mocked me when I was young. Now, I have offended and hurt many people, too. I often tell myself I'm helping them, and maybe in a way I am, but they certainly don't feel like I am helping at the time. I also used to say many things I don't remember. I think that happened because of the extreme difference between what I heard myself saying and what my wife heard me say. We remembered our words very differently. Was it just words or did you physically do things you can't remember?

   You definitely don't need to hurt yourself. It must be very hard, but you can grow out of this rough stage. It is sometimes too easy to hurt someone back. You must know you have talents or skills you can use for good. Maybe, with help from people like us, you can help yourself out of your habits and find a path away from self-destructive vengeance. Talk to us. Tell us more about what's going on.",t3_a12re2

That's not narcissism, that's psychosis, you need to see a professional as soon as possible.

We can't help you, not really, losing contact with reality is not an issue of personality, you need clinical diagnosis, don't waste any more time here.",t3_a12re2
eat98q9,t3_a12re2,"Many people are and don't realize it.

So you're slightly ahead of most people.

Do you have a therapist?

Realizing you're a covert narc is not great, but it's not the end of the world either.

I mean, it's something you can work on.

Whether or not people have ""mocked"" you or that's just paranoia, your family and friends probably still \*love\* you, faults and all.

(And chances are they're probably a little narcissistic, too).",t3_a12re2

eamfjvr,t1_eamf68e,"This is really hard. I want to keep my narcissism in mind. So that I don't forget it. But I already forgot it once. I knew, but I forgot. I don't want to forget it again. I want to know what kind of person I am.",t3_a12re2
eas5g4w,t1_eap8j2j,"Thanks for your reply! Yeah, I am constantly thinking of suicide. Everyone’s lying to me around. They all say what a good person I am, but that’s all lies. I just want to be left alone, but will I go insane if I stay alone? Do I always need people as a supply? Even when I am selfaware? I am lost. The whole world is against me.",t3_a12re2
eas58ex,t1_eaniy7d,"If getting over it means forgetting who I am, I don’t want it. Even my psychiatrists lie that I am not a narcissist. How should one live like that in constant lies around?",t3_a12re2
eas5hyy,t1_eao2z4y,I perhaps have a psychotic depression as a result of my narcissism. Narcissists are often paranoid.,t3_a12re2

eamg4kc,t1_eamfjvr,"Try keeping something positive in mind,  like creating an intention to consider other's feelings, or to be aware of the people around you. Even resolving to mechanically do things that you know other people appreciate, like calling once a week to check in with people close to you, can help you practice being a better person. ",t3_a12re2
eaumbj4,t1_eas5g4w,"Until selfawareness happens just in your rational mind it is powerless. You need to experiment things with your emotional mind in order to trigger real insights.

8 years ago my psycho told to me about narcissism. Only this summer I surrended to that concept, due to a coincidence of facts. I got lucky, because now I'm able to admit to myself my old habit of telling lies, first of all to myself.

And now I'm able to recall I was telling lies to that psycho, 8 years ago, with the sole purpose to not allowing her to bring me to the point of changing, to the point of making those experieces that would cause insights about my inner thoughts.

Do not stop to desire the change. Keep feeding faith on that. This had been the thought that (maybe) saved me.",t3_a12re2

easbxs6,t1_eas5hyy,"Still, you should put more attention to that than the personality issue.",t3_a12re2
eaujwp7,t1_eas5hyy,"Yes, I was paranoid and still now I could be paranoid if I do not stop the process.

My experience teach me that the best thing I can do is talking about my suspects to others, even if this leads to a felling of shame. Making them laugh is better than feeding my paranoias and, at the same time, is a good exercise for a sane way of social living.

You can exit from narcissism only by laughing about yourself. It can sounds inacceptable if you dealed with real tragedies (hurting others, failing your life), but it's the only way that makes sense to me. Better way than ... the other, extreme, way.",t3_a12re2

eamgi1t,t1_eamg4kc,"Right now I'm in shock. I don't even think properly, let alone speaking to others. Everything reminds me of what I am. Everything. People mock me around. My girlfriend knew that I am a narcissist. Just like her friends. They just laughed at me. I don't blame them. I deserve it, but I don't know what to do. English is not my first language, but even if it was, I am not sure that I would be able to say something straight right now. I am afraid to sleep because I may forget what I know. I want to live in truth, but it seems impossible to me.",t3_a12re2

eamgrgh,t1_eamgi1t,"Nobody deserves to be treated badly when they're in pain. If you have NPD, then it's no different than any other disorder in that you didn't choose it. If you're depressed as well, you should reach out and try to find help.  

You also say you don't want to forget; keeping a journal is a great way to remember. ",t3_a12re2
