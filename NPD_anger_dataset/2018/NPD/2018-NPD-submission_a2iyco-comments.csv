eb27s4q,t3_a2iyco,""" When Zusya was dying, his eyes filled with tears. His students surrounded him and questioned, “Why are you crying? Don’t you know that you will receive a heavenly reward:?” Zuysa responded, “When I get to next world, they are not going to ask me, why weren’t you Moses? They never expected me to be Moses. They are not going to ask me, why weren’t you Rabbi Akiba? They never expected me to be Rabbi Akiba. They are going to ask me, why weren’t you Zusya. I am crying, because I am asking myself, why wasn’t I Zusya?""",t3_a2iyco
eb151a6,t3_a2iyco,"I just started being blatantly honest.  I was diagnosed when I was 21 and I didn't take heed to much of it.. made some mental changes but nothing significant in my eyes. 

I told my last girlfriend everything and truly confided in her.. she's a unicorn and I wound up fucking that one up too!! 

Good luck to you.  I'm trying my absolute best to try and love like a normal human being..  ",t3_a2iyco
eazvnrc,t3_a2iyco,"You need to talk to a therapist, maybe try to find a better one. Also, your thoughts sound a little more like paranoia than necessarily narcissistic. I’m not a therapist, but your feelings that everyone is secretly mocking you just sounds more like a paranoia issue to me.

Talk to your girlfriend about it as well. Try to be more open with her. If she’s been with you three years then she must care about you at the least. Ask her feelings about the matter. It’s scary but honestly we here at this sub won’t be able to tell you what your girlfriend thinks or feels—only she will be able to.",t3_a2iyco
