ecv28q8,t3_aaqcoy,"You're looking at this all wrong. His emotional neediness, his requirements of validation, his demands for attention are no longer your problem. You're free. You were replaced because you wouldn't give enough, and now you don't need to give literally any.

Unless you're aspiring to be a attention-sow, kept just nurtured enough to keep producing with as few costs as possible like some sick mental factory farm, exactly what are you missing out on?",t3_aaqcoy
ecwo13n,t3_aaqcoy,"Why do you care about his new relationship? He treated you like trash. He's still treating you like trash. He wouldn't tell you so much about this new girl if he didn't think that would hurt you. Let him go. Focus on yourself and your child. 

",t3_aaqcoy
ed2h189,t3_aaqcoy,"I'd hazard a guess and say that your both very similar in personality, the problem being you have become dull (not in a bad sense) you don't reflect back an image of his false self anymore..... because you've seen him properly and not just once or twice but its likely that the false self is a dull grainy memory a dirty mirror so to speak. He sees that reflection of himself when he looks at you because your longing for the person you fell in love with, which was actually your reflection he was mirroring you his false self was you. Your daughter speaks highly of this women in my opinion because she feels similar to you it's like she already knows her.
Its obviously very painful but you have your daughter and credit to you for allowing her to speak freely to you and keeping that self restraint .... very strong .      ",t3_aaqcoy
eelu95g,t3_aaqcoy,"He is triangulating you with the new girl Especially since it happened right after you went out with your male friend. 

Why else would he tell you he talks to her for hours etc. 

My ex tried this with many people, including a family friend who was like a mother to me. I cut her, and the rest of them off from my life. I will NOT let my emotions be puppeteered by him through a third party. 

I know how bad it sucks. My kids talk about the new gf (a literal hooker he paid to blow him and moved into our home a month after I left him, and then got pregnant) 

My daughter at one point told me "" XYZ let me cook with her..... Is it okay if I cook with her"" and I too had to hide feelings and tell her that was nice, it's okay, etc. 

I also felt replaced and wondered if he treated her better. But he was still trying to hook up with me IE cheating on her, so clearly there's no change. 

I would wonder what made her so worthy of his love when he never loved me etc. 

Eventually though, I just felt sorry for her. I know the hell that is to come. And I wouldn't wish it on anyone. 

You should look into grey rocking him. Just Google the term. You can't go NC (no contact) because of your child, but you CAN grey rock him, and minimize all contact. 

During the school year, all exchanges are done through the school. For example on a Friday he picks up our son from school, and returns him to school Monday morning. 

Breaks are split to where one of us has him the full break, etc. 

We have yet to hit summer, and the divorce isn't finalized, but little things like this prevent contact, manipulation, and headaches. 

I ignore texts and calls unless they're an actual emergency. Which has yet to happen. I have messenger kids (an app separate from fb messenger) that's just for kids and very safe/controlled so that our son can talk to his dad without his dad harrassing me pretending it's to talk to him. (He would never even talk to him he'd just find something to argue with me about instead so messenger kids has stopped this.) 

At school events or mutual functions, ignore him at all costs. If he approaches you say you need to go to the bathroom or something. Try not to be awkward bc the little one will notice. If absolutely necessary just grey rock him there. (Be as exciting as a grey rock) give dull boring responses. 

These are just a few of the things I can think of, but they've really gotten the point across that I will not be a supply source any longer. ",t3_aaqcoy
edrmy3r,t3_aaqcoy,"It sounds like you are a co-dependent.  You can look for videos about how to deal with narcissists.  If you can't ghost them, which is really the best way to deal with them, you can try other tricks to break free from their spell.  The videos talk about their tricks.  Watching those videos really helped me process why I felt the things I felt.  ",t3_aaqcoy

ecvvcib,t1_ecvktdk,"Children are hardly a good barometer of what’s interesting and good in the world. She’s new, therefore she is interesting. And if his behavior is unchanged, I suspect she’ll be gone before you know it.",t3_aaqcoy
ecxrnii,t1_ecwzmea,"Well, meet her then. If she's a big presence in your child's life, you should get to know her. 

On a side note, how would it affect you if you found out he does treat her better? What difference would that make? Speaking as a narcissist, treating someone well doesn't mean I care about them. I could see someone as completely worthless and still spoil them rotten, be there for them whenever they need me and make them believe that I care. I've been emotionally abusive to some exes but not others. Don't know why. I certainly never cared about the ones I didn't try to abuse. 

What I'm trying to say is; you can't link your value as a person to the way someone treats you. Especially not a narcissist.",t3_aaqcoy
ed3sb4b,t1_ed2n9j5,"Listen, he will do to her what he did to you. If she is ""stronger"" it will just take a bit longer to break her down until she is right where you were, once. That is just our way. We wouldn't pick someone we didn't think we could do it to. Period.

 You have made it out, consider yourself LUCKY. Some people never do. Go on their entire lives miserable. being disrespected and treated like an object. You can find someone who is actually capable of loving you in a healthy, human manner now. No matter how much you gave or changed  yourself or bent over backwards before, that would not have been possible with your child's father. He just... Can't.

But He is quite literally someone else's problem, now. You should wish her, this girl, the best. Your only emotion for either of them, and truly, for anyone who suffers from this disorder, is rightly pity. They can neither love nor allow themselves to BE loved, really, and that is deeply sad.

Good luck",t3_aaqcoy
ed68xyt,t1_ed2n9j5,"I think you need to think of it like this... it might help because it helped me...

Look at his new gf in pity and more like a mother would see her. She doesn’t know what’s coming and I feel sorry and sad for her. She’s probably excited about these new beginnings with this new man who will eventually devalue and push her away. He will most likely treat her horribly – eventually. If you look at her in an empathetic light, it may help with your inner hurt? ",t3_aaqcoy

I am the same way but have been trying to figure out the difference in personality types that make me react certain ways. For me, the behaviors exist on a spectrum and certain personality types ""trigger"" my N traits much more than others (speaking to relationships specifically).

Also I am curious as to hearing someone else's reasons for the ""spoiling though I see them as worthless"" aspect. What goes through your mind at times like those?",t3_aaqcoy

ed2jg1e,t1_ecxv5i4,"Oh, so he talks to you about the girlfriend but doesn't want you two to meet? Weird. How old is your daughter? Young enough to be confused by this dad's new gf thing?",t3_aaqcoy
edb43wo,t1_ed3rifm,"My unhealthiest relationships have been with people who let the relationship get that unhealthy and wouldn't/couldn't leave. So I guess a mix of loneliness and low self esteem.

Well. When I have a crush on someone I get this very strong urge to just drown them in affection. I feel like they're the brightest light in any room and I just *have* to show them how I feel. Although this infatuation doesn't last long and doesn't link to any appreciation for who that person really is.",t3_aaqcoy

ed6h2so,t1_ed2lx1e,I've seen a lot of victims focus on the past abuse and lose sight of what really matters. You however appear to have a good head on your shoulders and are doing what's best for you and your daughter. So relieved to see that. I don't have any advice for you but I think you'll get through this as long as you hold on to that logic.,t3_aaqcoy
