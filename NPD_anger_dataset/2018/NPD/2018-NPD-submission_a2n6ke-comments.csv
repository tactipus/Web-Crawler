eb0pos5,t3_a2n6ke,"Have you seen the show ""The Good Place"" on Netflix? I won't spoil it, but you might want to check it out. I feel it might be relevant to your experience. The gist is how actions and deeds are more important than words.


And, hey - don't be too hard on yourself. Honestly, the best way for you to show your committment to your family right now is through your actions and deeds. Do not underestimate how big of a deal it is for you to be contributing to the household chores and parenting, because that's a HUGE deal. 

Are you familiar with the concept of ""mental load"" for mothers? If not, this comic should be very helpful - https://english.emmaclit.com/2017/05/20/you-shouldve-asked/ By helping around the house and with the kids, *especially when you see what needs to be done and just do it, rather than waiting to be asked*, it reduces your wife's mental load. And, seriously, this is probably the #1 issue in most relationships with children, so it's great that you're being proactive!


The rest will come in time. Don't try to make changes all at once - just focus on being an active member of your family and being present mentally.",t3_a2n6ke
