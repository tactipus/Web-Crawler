ebdfk06,t3_a4cyd9,"Have you heard of the concept of narcissistic 'fleas'? They are behaviors we pick up from narcissistic parents and caregivers. Unlike full blown NPD, they can be modified with therapy and effort. 

Have you been diagnosed with NPD? If not, I would consider the idea that you have some fleas.",t3_a4cyd9
ebebsq8,t3_a4cyd9,You were spoilt by one parent and demeaned by another you'll likely become NPD.,t3_a4cyd9
ebkp5r5,t3_a4cyd9,"My parents are both quite narcissistic, and both also have a good bit of BPD behaviors too, which I think can also promote NPD.

I had the same experience as you, telling myself I didn't ever want to treat others ""like that."" But while I succeeded in some ways, I definitely didn't succeed in others. I'm a work in progress, like anyone who is a responsible human being.

We don't yet know how much of NPD, BPD, etc. is hereditary and how much is caused by environment. It's likely some combination. People have always known that behavior is passed down, and it's probably no exception when the parent has a personality disorder.

However, I would also say that factors outside the home can contribute too.",t3_a4cyd9
ebdc0ly,t3_a4cyd9,"You dont have NPD if youre writing this. I went through the same thought process. Then I thought I hard borderline. Strongest suggestions from my therapist include bipolar, generalized anxiety, depression, ADD, or combinations of these.",t3_a4cyd9
ebptmht,t3_a4cyd9,"Yes, I believe one of them had very strong NPD/cluster B traits at least. Not a doctor to diagnose myself, per say",t3_a4cyd9
eccw0a9,t1_ebebsq8,"Do you mind sharing more about that? My Nsister was abused and demeaned constantly by our father, and spoiled (not loved, not sincerely praised or given positive attention to, but just constantly told she was better than others) by our mother. I've always thought it was that weird combination that turned her into a narcissist, but I've never read anything that confirmed my theory. ",t3_a4cyd9
ecdrrk6,t1_eccw0a9,"I've read it elsewhere but it is also my own conjecture. You were demeaned by someone who had power over you you can feel very powerless and have a need to immediately compensate in order to protect against the fear of being powerless, by doing something that demonstrates and reinforces your power (overpowering another). 

If the other parent enabled this, you feel that you are deserving of this behaviour and you continue doing it more.

If the other parent also punished you, you are going to feel unable to release your energy and eventually turn it on yourself. ",t3_a4cyd9
ecedw4y,t1_ecdrrk6,That makes so much sense. Thank you for the explanation. ,t3_a4cyd9
