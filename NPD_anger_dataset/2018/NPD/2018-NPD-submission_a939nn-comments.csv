ecg9v9m,t3_a939nn,"NPD is a complex disorder. Only a professional could diagnose you, however here are a few questions that could help identify if you are, or not, a narcissist (note : this is a comment I posted on another, older post.)

Do you feel entitled to being well treated, better than others, and feel easily as of people disrespect you? Are you secretly convinced than people work against you because they're jealous of you?

Do you have a facade that you put on to show the world how awesome you are but feel a never-ending void behind that facade that you try to ignore at all cost? Is your self-esteem super high but fragile (as in, a tiny thing can trigger immense rage and a need to defend yourself), or secretly very low and you work super hard to pretend you're actually awesome?

Did you grow up in a messed up family, were you pushed to he the greatest, or were you the Golden Child, always praised and enabled no matter what you did?

How is your memory? Do people often tell you you've said or done something that would make you look bad, but you genuinely don't remember doing/saying that?

Regarding issues in your relationships, whether friendship, romantic interests or anything else, do you feel like others have more efforts to do than you? Do you usually feel like a victim and that your worth is never validated enough?

Narcissism can be portrayed very differently from one person to another (it's more like a spectrum really), and I'm not a professional therapist. But with those questions you could have a better idea of whether you fit in the NPD mindset or not :)",t3_a939nn

Most of the time I advise people with NPD to help themselves by journaling. That helps have a clearer idea of how your mind works, and realize where you might contradict yourself. That could help you too understand what are those needs that you feel aren't met. After a while you can read back what you wrote and ask yourself if you would accept the same demands from someone else.",t3_a939nn
