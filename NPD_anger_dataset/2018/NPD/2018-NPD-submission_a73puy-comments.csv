The typical heightened empathy of BPD versus the lack with NPD can be hit or miss; you can have some narcissistic traits with your BPD, if that's what you do have, without necessarily having the lowered empathy.

A lot of this is pretty familiar to me personally. I used to be a really shitty person, actively emotionally abusive, et cetera.

The first step is realizing it, so you're doing okay, assuming you have an end goal of altering your behavior.

What helped me a lot was realizing that... when you're nice to people, they stay, and they give you nice things as long as you keep being generous and nice to them, and they'll say nice things about how kind you are, and they don't really... care why you're doing it as long as you are. Ulterior motives to kindness don't matter, it's the kindness itself that does.

That being said, trying to be more self-aware and not wanting to hurt other people when you're hurting is a good end goal even if it's not where you're at right now. I had a lot of really supportive people who helped me through the worst of it; if it's safe to do so, I'd suggest bringing up your issues with your boyfriend, and trying to work through it together, like giving him something he can do when you get upset that will help you without making him necessarily lose his ground, if anything like that exists.

I hope this was at all helpful, I'm kind of just talking out my ass based on personal experience.",t3_a73puy

Firstly, virtually everyone is emotionally abusive at some point. I just feel the need to make that clear. 

I do think a lot of the things you list are worrying. I hope you seek out a good therapist for a potential diagnosis. Only a therapist or psychiatrist can diagnose you. 

If you do have it, it will have a profound effect on all areas of your life, making it difficult to work and have any relationships. So I really hope you seek help. 

Best wishes. ",t3_a73puy
ec1m1hl,t3_a73puy,"I would say the first 2 steps in this thing are:

1) Realization (which you've done)

and

2) Stop hurting other people on purpose

Good luck, friend",t3_a73puy

ec0vd9d,t1_ec0q61g,"Yeah, it's a hard thing to realize--and hard not to internally justify when you're hurting--but this is the right direction to be going in.

Of course! Happy to help.",t3_a73puy
