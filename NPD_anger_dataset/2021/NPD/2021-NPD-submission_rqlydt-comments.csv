First of all, ask people personally if they’re having a party.

Second of all, you seem like a person that comes off as the teachers pet that can’t take any jokes. Sorry don’t know why

Don’t pretend to be mentally unwell, most people feel exhausted being around people like that

No one will contact you if you isolate yourself, especially if no one answers when you post on insta

You can get revenge if you want to.
I would talk to the people more and go out to clubs or meet new people at work, you meet lots of people at work",t3_rqlydt
hqcw7vh,t3_rqlydt,"Surprisingly people started to like me more when I started disagreeing with them from time to time.

I keep getting told its refreshing. It also makes the convo more real for me.

Ultimately tho, and I speak from some real experience here, the self is always coming through. Everyone emanates a vibe/ aura. Once you sort out your internal stuff through healing/ therapy work it'll be straightforward. Truth is other people just got lucky, for the most part, socially.

Nothing to be yourself up about. Just be smart, think long-term, and you'll be a-okay ;).",t3_rqlydt
hqc5rfa,t1_hqc36lb,"yeah I have to agree, my thoughs seem rather weird // and even if I ask people, they say that i could come but then I don't get notified any further than that plus everyone else gets invited somehow, ig they have some kind of whatsappgroup or smth. additionally i think that always begging to belong seems a bit forced, just kinda looks like you're desperate af and cant accept defeat etc..

also i've learnt my lesson when it comes to pretending to be mentally unwell. Yes, I did it and it was cringe (I was like 10 too haha), but nowadays I do the excact opposite (yk kinda trying to be the happy and funny person) <- also because I once saw a drunk guy talk about his suicidality who instantly got comforted, so I though that I could pull this off...

And yes I know that whatever I have planned seems quite irrational and nonsensical, especially when looking at it again.  maybe i am just an overly sensitive dumbass lol

Thanks for the reality check tho, needed this",t3_rqlydt
hqelfrq,t1_hqc5rfa,It's okay if you pretended to be mentally unwell I've done it before too lol dont worry about not fitting in/belonging to a group. It sucks sometimes but just tell yourself you dont need to belong there and you'll slowly start to believe it? Sorta worked for me in the past. As for not feeling emotionally close to anyone-most npds don't (prob from lack of empathy/no empathy) so dont beat yourself up over it. Don't worry about not having a boyfriend lol a lot of guys suck anywaym. And you're not a dumbass!!,t3_rqlydt
