hq81xme,t3_rpy9oj,"I would start with a body. Nice looking, but mostly average. Something the said human could live, but would have a hard time being conceited over. 

Then, for the personality, I would make them overall whole. They would love themselves and know their purpose in this life. For the little add-ons, I'd make them kind, have a good sense of humor, etc. It can really have any extra things you want as long as the core is whole. Like a jelly donut. 

Then I'd give them some imperfections. Things that make them human. But nothing crippling or too negative. Maybe a little arrogant at times, or easily hurt, or overly optimistic—just something normal that still might cause problems, but nothing too bad or serious. 

And then I'd place them in a controlled environment full of love and healthy discipline. 

...that's not what you meant by making a new human? Oh... whoops.",t3_rpy9oj
hq9kukn,t3_rpy9oj,"The key you're missing is emotions. Reconnect to your feelings because they create identity. Start an emotions journal, learn about the true purpose of emotions and examine your own relationship with emotions and why you are so resistant to them. In most cases this is because we've been gaslighted a lot or punished for showing emotions. You don't create yourself, you rediscover yourself. It's impossible to discover this from the mind alone, the mind needs the help of emotions. Start by recognizing them and writing down how you feel regularly, where you notice the emotions in your body and maybe what color they would be. Once you feel like you can label your emotions at any time you can start identifying where the emotion originated. Once you can track back your emotions you can start to ask them what they're trying to tell you (for example jealousy points us towards our fear of losing something that is dear to us). This will tell you what you need. So once you can clearly identify your needs you can find healthy ways to express your emotions to others consciously - this is what people call boundaries. And boundaries are nothing other than your identity.",t3_rpy9oj

hq9oy2x,t3_rpy9oj,"Spend long periods of time in solitude (so you aren't in ""performing mode"") and journal about your thoughts, feelings, motivations, opinions, observe what you like and you don't like. That's what works for me to reconnect with myself.",t3_rpy9oj
hq96rdc,t3_rpy9oj,"This is what it looked like for me to love. I used to loathe myself on a deep level. 

I started accepting complements at face value. Even when I felt It was not deserved or I true. I told myself: they think I am beautiful (or whatever) from their pov i must be. 

Slowly that became I am beautiful when I had a good hair day. 

I started taking care of myself on a regular bases. I upgraded my clothes, my lifestyle and my home. With quality not quantity. 

Then slowly but surely I started to ask myself what do I want my life to feel like. So far I had worked on the appearance and looks of my life. So I startes doing more thats fun. Seeking friends that didn’t bring drama but fun and joy and great times. 

Then I learned that all these things are great to have.  But I am of inherent value. No matter other peoples opinions (good or bad) no matter my monetary situation. 

To put it in my sons words: mom you are valuable even if you lie in bed all day and don’t do anything. You being here alive and well is the important thing for us. 

Hope this helps",t3_rpy9oj
hqa4j22,t3_rpy9oj,"I don't have NPD, but I have some disorders so I can understand how you feel.

I would start by accepting myself (all the good and bad in me), realising that there is a problem, but keeping in mind that when I work on it, I CAN get better, forgiving myself (forgive myself what I feel guilty about, my mistakes...), and starting to build a better self-confidence (loving myself... Affirmations can help, self-awareness too. Understanding that I am a human and humans make mistakes can help as well).
Then finding my bad habits and being aware of them, trying to recognise when I am doing them and stopping with it.
Trying to spend some time alone and having fun. Getting to know myself better, my hobbies, favorite things to do and so on. Distracting myself from the negative thoughts and trying to build my own life by doing things I like.

I think accepting and forgiving yourself, then building a self-confidence will help, because then you won't need to prove you are better. You will believe in yourself. You will still probably have some thoughts about proving yourself, but they won't be as strong as they have been.

I know it's hard to do this, but there are many people who have done it, so you can too.",t3_rpy9oj
hqha35m,t3_rpy9oj,"There are so many theories about the ""personality"" in personality disorder. Something I heard from my therapist once was that it isn't about personality so much as it is about the tools we use to deal with our own shit and the world around us. Maybe try building a new tool box?",t3_rpy9oj
hq7ri3n,t1_hq7q9b3,Yea man thats a good first step thanks,t3_rpy9oj
hq8dlsb,t1_hq81xme,If it were only that easy,t3_rpy9oj
hq94139,t1_hq81xme,"Does anyone really know their purpose in this life? Also, I really like your response found it funny and am inspired to sort of write out who I would be if I could mold myself out of clay…it’s a cool writing prompt if anything .",t3_rpy9oj
hq9pfd8,t1_hq9kukn,Thanks the willingness to help in this community brings tears to my eyes,t3_rpy9oj
hq7wqm9,t1_hq7v6o1,It really don't feel like it at the time,t3_rpy9oj
hqa7aow,t1_hqa4j22,How do you go about forgiving yourself. I just can't help but got stuck in a loop of dwelling on negative actions and or fears and just can't let it go.,t3_rpy9oj
hqhb20k,t1_hqha35m,You know I was working myself to that conclusion to be honest it's all about how you deal with things,t3_rpy9oj
hq94r53,t1_hq94139,"Imma writer. Guess it checks out. 

Not a good writer if you were wondering I just suck at it but enjoy it.",t3_rpy9oj
hqa96m1,t1_hqa7aow,"First of all, you need to feel those emotions. The sadness, the guilt, the anger... I've learnt that supressing or ignoring them will only make everything worse.
Cry, scream, curse. Talk it out. Apologise. Do anything you want to just to feel them and live through them.
Know that you are never alone and there are people like you. Know that you are a human and making mistakes makes you human.
Know that you can't change what has already happened, but now that you are aware, you can change the future, even if your past hasn't been good.
Accept that it happened and there is no way to undo it. Everyone makes mistakes that they regret later, there is nothing wrong with you. 
I don't know what exactly happened, but know that you have done it because you thought at that time that it was good (or good for you, or just thought that it was normal/okay). There is nothing wrong with you for making mistakes, especially when you have a disorder (Im not saying to hide behind the diagnosis, but it's true that it affected you).
When you have lower self-confidence, it's harder to forgive yourself, but it's still possible. Maybe you think you deserve to suffer (I don't know how exactly you feel, so Im sorry if it's inaccurate). But you don't. Everyone makes mistakes and if we all have to be punished for doing it, there would be nobody alive. Nobody is a Saint And there are Millions of people who do bad things on purpose, just because they want to.",t3_rpy9oj
hqaaedj,t1_hqa7aow,"Also, a therapy should help.
I forget to tell you that I'm proud of you for admitting you have a problem and wanting to change. It's a very big and hard step. You want to be better and that's what matters.",t3_rpy9oj
hqhbc57,t1_hqhb20k,"Yes it is. You can read yourself into a tailspin within the world of psychiatry-- it's exhausting and so pathologizing. Start small, figure out what things you need to work on and then try and try and try again. You've got this.",t3_rpy9oj
