hqkyuon,t3_rs1hth,"Can you share the study please? Stress related studies are often not reliable because they rely mainly on self report. No offense, but that's extremely distorted - especially for ppl with personality disorders. Did they also evaluate blood or hair cortisol in addition or heart rate variability? Also, I definitely wouldn't refer to narcissists as truly self confident and since in most cases narcissism is a response to trauma I would argue that their nervous systems would be over active therefore causing a lot of stress, which sometimes makes cortisol measurement impossible. It would be worth looking at the study in more detail.",t3_rs1hth

hqkkdhz,t3_rs1hth,Psychopaths are the most stress resistant tho,t3_rs1hth
hqjl4oc,t3_rs1hth,"Yesss I’ve literally made a post about this! Apart from the downs when your whole world feels as if it’s unravelling, this disorder is a blessing in disguise in todays cutthroat world. What people don’t realise is most of society is run by sociopathic and NPD type of people. That’s capitalism as a whole. And everyone on some level is narcissistic. We have the power to remain calm, confident, we ALWAYS know how to spin a situation in our favour and come out on top. People would kill to have our traits and would probably do some $5000 life coaching course to “achieve self esteem” or “go for their goals”.",t3_rs1hth
hqjs3sn,t3_rs1hth,"People with NPD tend to create a lot of stress for others. I'm not sure how positive it is that individuals with this condition don't also feel the stress that they inflict on others, it just seems emblematic of the lack of empathy that defines this condition and the problems it causes- rather than an actual positive.",t3_rs1hth
hqkjmpk,t3_rs1hth,I am following your posts. I agree with you wholeheartedly. Thank you for your work. We all could use some reasons to feel good here.,t3_rs1hth
hqmhoed,t3_rs1hth,Many narcissistic traits correlate to great leadership qualities.,t3_rs1hth
hqkz9ye,t1_hqkyuon,"Google it please.

No psychology study is ever ""100% accurate"", this is psychology, you can always disregard any study you like, for as many reasons you like (very normal in the professional field, based on your research preference).

Thanks for your input.",t3_rs1hth
hqjt4bb,t1_hqjqblp,glad that makes you happy..,t3_rs1hth
hqkp8jo,t1_hqkkdhz,sorry this has nothing to do with that type of pathology..,t3_rs1hth
hqjmjz8,t1_hqjl4oc,"GREAT addition! Glad to see we understand this.. this is a blessing indeed..

Hahaa its funny that you say we can charge for that! I do share the sentiment that we are ""lucky"" in some ways, really lucky..

Having said that, its not all roses of course :)",t3_rs1hth
hqjt2tn,t1_hqjs3sn,you can join the demonizing bandwagon as you please.. this is not the post intention..,t3_rs1hth
hqkp69z,t1_hqkjmpk,Thanks for the kind words indeed; hope we help each other.,t3_rs1hth
hqmlmlh,t1_hqmhoed,"That is so true, and much research points to that too..",t3_rs1hth
hql02q2,t1_hqkz9ye,I know because I'm a psychologist and I do research specifically about stress. So I know what makes studies in this area reliable. Obviously no study is perfect but that doesn't mean we can't give feedback about what makes them better. And I tell you that self reports only don't work in this area. There's specific studies on reliability of self reports compared to cortisol levels which show that stress is most of the times reported to be way lower than it actually is.,t3_rs1hth
hqjtu5z,t1_hqjt2tn,"I think it's important to focus on the bigger picture, not just isolated positive moments. Which is basically the core of NPD's splitting",t3_rs1hth
hql16vz,t1_hql02q2,"Very good, and we both agree. Any study in our field can be disregarded and there's always a ""valid reason""; yet we take it as they come. I know I respect this study, and all self-report studies, because ""real life situations"" are almost impossible to come by (with narcs or others).

Thanks for adding your point of view.",t3_rs1hth
hqjunw4,t1_hqjtu5z,"People here need some form of support, they came here because in seeing the bigger picture, they want to ""improve""; I am trying to show something positive about ""our"" lives, to help us be better..

It would not help if you would get all the negativity out their in this world, to put here, please understand this.. thanks..",t3_rs1hth
hqma6os,t1_hql16vz,I strongly disagree with these statements.,t3_rs1hth
hqk5q6b,t1_hqjunw4,"It's also important to consider criticism without trying to spin it as demonization though. Since a core trait of narcissism is creating a positive false self in the face of reality, I'm worried this post might just being doing just that.",t3_rs1hth
hqmlhx5,t1_hqma6os,"I guess you made your point clear once, twice, and thrice :)",t3_rs1hth
hqk88xz,t1_hqk5q6b,"Thanks for the criticism; well-noted with all due respect. Please from your part, understand the context, and feel free to create all the posts you wish to pin-point certain aspects of being a narc, its a problematic set of traits after all. The context I'm presenting is different, and don't worry, we all ""know"" of it, no need for never-ending emphasis.",t3_rs1hth
hqnhthx,t1_hqmlhx5,I had hoped for a little bit of a genuine discussion but I see I'm barking up the wrong tree. All the best.,t3_rs1hth
