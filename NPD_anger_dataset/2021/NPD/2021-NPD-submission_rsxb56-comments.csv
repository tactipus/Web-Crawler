hqpq5mp,t1_hqpj6xe,"That's true. He also killed himself. Of loneliness. 

We're not bound to end up the way he did. We're in a different situation. We have the wonders of contemporary Psychology. With that advantage, we can fix our shit.

hqprhuu,t1_hqpq5mp,"in 2022, narcissus is fitted with a VR headset that shows him a third person view of himself looking at his reflection in the water. he goes into therapy after and gets much better.",t3_rsxb56
hqpuxnt,t1_hqprhuu,"Pre self-awareness, I thought that being Narcissistic was cool. 38/40 on NPI, I was said to have talent for public speaking and shit. 

Being Narcissistic, to me, meant ""being superior for having no insecurities"". Loving one's self is a very happy thing after all. 

To this day, I believe that there's nothing wrong with loving myself. That's not the thing that I wanna fix. 

I wanna fix the inability to connect to others. Narcissus killed himself because a mirror reflection could not reciprocate his feelings.

What is love, when it is not reciprocated? An unhappy one.",t3_rsxb56
hr251ga,t1_hqpuxnt,"In addition to not connecting, NPD makes you delusional to your own abilities and makes you feel entitled. Both of these traits can hinder progress in your career as it did with mine. Just adding on the cons list.",t3_rsxb56
