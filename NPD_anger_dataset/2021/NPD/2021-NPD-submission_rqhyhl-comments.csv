hqaa7rh,t3_rqhyhl,I can also pick up on peoples energy easily & im a narcissist.,t3_rqhyhl
hqaarhj,t3_rqhyhl,"Not sure about empaths or NT's but in my case regarding reading people is that it feels like survival instinct like a looking for any change in facial features no matter how small, if it can be any danger to me or my inflated ego. It is both a blessing and a curse, but i am learning to live with it. No other choice i guess.",t3_rqhyhl
hqbima7,t3_rqhyhl,I swear there is the highest rate of unaware narcissists among those self-proclaimed empaths than anywhere on the internet,t3_rqhyhl
hqb4fay,t3_rqhyhl,"I think they mean emotional empathy, when you can mirror someone's feelings, like, your friend is crying because his girlfriend cheated on him, and you reflect his emotions like they're yours, feel bad for him deep in your heart, etc. I don't have that empathy, but I have cognitive when I can really guess what other person feels and put myself in their feet.",t3_rqhyhl
hqbl7uk,t3_rqhyhl,Empath is just a fancy word for virtue signalling narcissist in denial.,t3_rqhyhl
hqctzyn,t3_rqhyhl,"'Empaths' creep me out.

Had one girl who kept telling me I was feeling sad, and wouldn't allow me to leave the conversation with her until I admitted it 😂. Which i refused to do lmao",t3_rqhyhl
hqbzeuf,t3_rqhyhl,"Schrödinger’s empath: both capable of detecting emotions from the air but at the same time keep falling victim of the evil, manipulative narc.",t3_rqhyhl
hqc45v3,t3_rqhyhl,"I think ""empath"" is more from trauma and abuse. I'd be considered one. I get overwhelmed by people's negative feelings from living in fear...there is parts that may not be based in trauma like I have ""sixth sense"" in a lot of ways. But people that walk around proclaiming to be empaths in a new age way annoy the shit out of me",t3_rqhyhl
hqahweh,t3_rqhyhl,"I don't know about this ""trend"", but I call myself an empath because I have extremely strong affective Empathy and sometimes I feel even worse than the person whom I'm trying to help.",t3_rqhyhl
hqesdk8,t3_rqhyhl,"I think that both narcissists and codependents are empaths (look up dark empath) while one is anticipating emotions from the mind and the other from feeling them as body sensations. I used to be very codependent but after healing this part of me and taking full responsibility of my wellbeing I can still feel other's emotions as if they are my own but I don't feel responsible for them anymore. I'm not identified with them completely. This is why they're such a good match for each other - the relationship is focused on the narc's emotions superficially. I think people with NPD are equally as ""good"" in noticing other's motivations because they can target weak people easily, so they have to know somehow but they are 100% detached from other's emotions as well, while codependents are 100% identified with the other's emotions. Obviously both is equally unhealthy. I'm not a fan of huge narcissist/empath bashing that is happening everywhere. Everyone should take responsibility for themselves and own their shit. None of us are perfect. Who are we to judge how others try to cope with their life?",t3_rqhyhl
hqkm61x,t3_rqhyhl,"I think it's just a positive spin on being codependent. 
Or it's a convenient way to make someone's pain all about them which seems pretty narcissistic to me lol",t3_rqhyhl
hqt86o3,t3_rqhyhl,"Yep, narcs can pick up on peoples energy. This is a blessing and curse for them. Blessing meaning they can protect themselves and curse because they can also use it to their advantage and trigger that person. So this is a good and bad thing for them and people involved with them.",t3_rqhyhl
hqbxrs2,t1_hqbima7,"That was kinda what I was thinking, if I knew more about empaths when I wasn’t self aware I would’ve definitely went around telling people that I’m an empath😂",t3_rqhyhl
hqbisve,t1_hqbima7,I agree,t3_rqhyhl
hqlapfk,t1_hqb4fay,Yeah I’m the same way (I have aspd and npd as well),t3_rqhyhl
hqbxvd3,t1_hqbl7uk,But what I’ve understood is that empaths can feel when something is off with someone. Can most NPDs do that as well?,t3_rqhyhl
hqe2w19,t1_hqbzeuf,"They may be empaths, but because they focus on the other's emotions and less on other factors, they feel good when they make the narcissist feel good. They might be able to see the similarities in how the dynamic starts in each relationship, but because it feels good at the start they can be optimistic due to current feelings affecting their thoughts and worldview so much. Once things get too difficult for either party to understand and handle and anger fills the air, the empath finds it easy to suddenly see the narcissist as an evil piece of shit that should be killed, since the current emotions affect it all so much. It is blind rage: the other party is a narcissist because the empath says so. It is most likely that the other party is angry at the empath, and the empath feels it and turns it at them.

I do think that every individual is temperamentally compatible with a certain type of person, and that they fall in love with them only. For some people that might mean being compatible with temperaments prone to narcissism. It doesn't mean they'll always find themselves with narcissists, but the same core traits will be present in all of their love interests.",t3_rqhyhl
hqd2gsp,t1_hqc45v3,I agree. At some point these self proclaimed empaths become arrogant with assuming they know what everyone is feeling all the time and then making it about them. Reminds me of the onion skit where the reporter gets more emotional about a girls death than her family and the family ends up comforting him for their loss. Most people who claim to be empaths are not empaths. Simply observant and typical. And striving to be unique,t3_rqhyhl
hqe3aes,t1_hqc45v3,"I don't believe psychological trauma changes one all that much. Your internal reactions are the same they always would have been, but you may simply lack the self-understanding that someone with a luckier childhood would have at your age. Your brain is still the toolbox with the same tools as before (even if they might be utilized and sharpened in an unnatural, forced way due to lack of self-acceptance). I am an empath who does not get overwhelmed, and who manages to be helpful instead of turning others' pain against them, because I simply have had lucky experiences through which I have learnt a healthy and natural way of existing. I simply allow myself to feel without any need to react to it, as I know the feeling originates from others and that I should treat them well to make it go away - not attack them. This is especially important in a heated debate, or an argument in a relationship.",t3_rqhyhl
hqe1fo6,t1_hqbxrs2,Why - do you have a strong affective empathy or something that you could have confused for it?,t3_rqhyhl
hqbyokb,t1_hqbxvd3,"Well I think so. I have passed-by disturbing individuals without even exchanging words. Exchanging stares. Similar eyes and the expression to this I can see in a mirror, however cringy that sounds, it is pretty easy to detect. It's nothing out of ordinary either, I've been told I have a cold stare or ""overwhelming aura"" by some people and it's only fair to assume that only minority decide to voice that out. I think majority can detect that something is wrong by instinct, but not all of them decide to pay that much mind into it. Not many people trust their own instincts.

Either way, empaths happen to be the kind of narcissistic individuals who believe they have some sort of superpowers(sense of grandiosity) and they often express how morally superior they are to the peers. They're the first ones to stigmatize narcissists and label them. They will claim they can ""read"" you and assign you the traits or intentions you don't even have.",t3_rqhyhl
hqekr6h,t1_hqe2w19,"Reading the part about compatibility and an attraction towards certain traits made me think of attachment theory. 

An attraction is formed usually between people with insecure attachment. Dismissive avoidants (usually narcissists) end up together with anxious preoccupied people (let’s say empaths). They make each other suffer in familiar ways. Since people are not looking for an actual perfect match but rather for someone who gives them this feeling of familiarity. They way we remember receiving love in our childhood will look and feel attractive when we recognize it in someone else’s way of giving love. Considering that both dismissive avoidants and anxious preoccupied are insecure attachments, we’re talking more about two sides of the same coin: not getting proper affection and emotional safety during childhood. 

The thing is that even though we can observe patterns and certain things repeat themselves, we shouldn’t fall into the trap of hard labeling. 
Human relationships and emotions are extremely complex and not black and white. 

I would rather look at people’s tendency of making things black and white, of establishing and describing, for example, a very clear script for their relationship. They watch 2 dr Ramani videos about narcissistic abuse and all of a sudden their  relationship is no longer something with many shades of grey, with good times and bad times. All of a sudden it’s very clearly categorized with very well defined steps.

I am diagnosed NPD but I am anxious preoccupied. My main symptom of NPD is problems with whole object constancy. The idea that something is good and bad at the same time. Not just black or just white, but shades of grey, sometimes black, sometimes white. I understand this concept on the intellectual level, but then I observe that in my relationships, I find it really hard to comprehend that someone can love me and hurt me at the same time, for example. And I used to be completely confused about why all materials on the internet about NPD are pointing towards this very thing, this separation, this labeling. Narcs are these evil demons set out to manipulate and destroy the precious innocent empaths. It seems that the very thing that I am trying to “fix”, is being presented as a strategy and as a “golden framework method” for being. That’s why I find videos, discussion boards, books, tiktoks etc on this subject to be extremely damaging not only towards people with NPD (by perpetuating the stigma and discouraging people from getting the help and treatment that they need) but also towards neurotypicals because it shifts the focus from understanding, internal observation, own healing journey towards a black and white toxic way of being that most of the time does not provide neither comfort, nor healing and not even understanding of what happened.",t3_rqhyhl
hqfazt6,t1_hqe3aes,"Well my therapist once said you drop me in a war zone and id be fine, similar to what your saying.....but  there is more to it that isn't understood yet. I have 2 siblings they each have a cluster b, I the youngest and probably most abused, dont.....",t3_rqhyhl
hqe1m8e,t1_hqbyokb,"I have also seen people like that call themselves empaths on the Internet. However, I am nearly certain they cannot be empaths, as they seem to be much more emotionally self-driven. Empaths do not have a sense of right or wrong like that, with which we could label anyone good or bad. We are in many ways quite callous regardless of a strong and universal affective empathy, exactly because we are not emotionally self-driven enough to have guilt for what we do.",t3_rqhyhl
hqe3l63,t1_hqe1m8e,"Eh, in my eyes, empaths don't exist. I figure if I wasn't diagnosed with NPD I would call myself and empath because I thought I could read people very well and emphatize with them.",t3_rqhyhl
