hq2i5tq,t3_rp652y,"I am not diagnosed but I feel I at least have many traits since I was raised by a borderline mum and narcissist father. I think it is hard to be diagnosed as a covert narcissist unless you have been seeing a therapist for years to the point you let your guard down, if you ever do. It's really complex. 

I do not do well letting down my guard so, besides with my partner who, because I hold as superior to me I do not often act out, no one has any clue.",t3_rp652y
hq2niqa,t3_rp652y,I relate to all the symptoms of covert narcissism but havent gotten diagnosed yet. About 3 years ago I went to a therapist and she told me I have anxiety,t3_rp652y
hq2self,t3_rp652y,"Depends how you define ""covert"" narcissist. Given it's not a diagnostic criteria recognized in the dsm. I relate to this description of ""compensatory"" narcissism tho https://www.ptypes.com/compensatory-narpd.html",t3_rp652y
hq5ljem,t3_rp652y,"Jsyk, literally everybody has a 'persona' which is akin to the mask of narcissism; and it could easily be misconstrued.

A professional who has worked with patients with PDs/NPD should be able to easily diagnose a covert narcissist.

Most people don't really understand narcissism, and especially covert narcissism; but a trained professional will be able to recognize it.",t3_rp652y
hq3w2ua,t1_hq2niqa,were you 100% honest wit her?,t3_rp652y
hq5woev,t1_hq5ljem,"it's not always that easy to recognize narcissists, especially covert ones. with some research it's surprisingly easy to lie on personality tests, and in order to get an accurate diagnosis you have to be transparent with your therapist, which usually takes a lot of time. 

i've recently started seeing a therapist and i'm slowly trying to get to the topic of possible npd with her. she brought the possibility of comorbid personality disorders up once after i got my adhd diagnosis and it's how i started researching npd.",t3_rp652y
hq3weq3,t1_hq3w2ua,"No I wasn't. I froze up and I was waiting for her to ask me questions so I could open up. It was also my first ever therapy appointment so I was very nervous! What happened was I told her I was anxious and she gave me a prescription for anxiety meds all within 20 minutes. I only took them for like 3 days, as the dose was too high and I felt crappy",t3_rp652y
hq3x0iz,t1_hq3weq3,"anxiety medication isnt supposed to work instantly and the first weekS you feel shitty, it settles down

also therapy is not a one time thing, it takes time. I recommend giving it a try again",t3_rp652y
hq3x8ro,t1_hq3x0iz,Yeah I know but even she admitted the dose was too high & she was not a good therapist tbh (or maybe just not a good fit) I went to another one recently who was not psychiatrist but he asked me questions and got me to open up. That's what a good therapist is supposed to do..with him I was able to be honest,t3_rp652y
hq3xg6n,t1_hq3x8ro,"thats good, you should tell him about npd, hes gonna be able to understand why you say certain things a certain way",t3_rp652y
