Usually we spend Xmas with family and New Year with friends.
But recently my gf found out about us, btw you can read my other posts, so she get pretty jealous(i told her a lie that i know she isnt believjng but stuffs are still pretty ok toward us... maybe she doesnt want see this). Now I wanna keep a sec from the party to writing here, hoping my being high wont ruin my post.
We as always get closer and closer, we are doing party and we are dancing and drinking together... we are young adults, this are the best years of our life.
But hiding us is killing us... he is a man, my parents are pretty homophobic.
Now usually i wouldnt care but with him is different : im damn in love, trying to be different for him and being a better person with more humanity.
I still wondering if it worth break with my gf, she isnt such bad but at contrary she is stable and we got a prettyfine together... she lets me to having the perfect straight life: easy and stable.
With him is the opposite: he is bpd, he is unstable but he would climbe Everest for me.
Now we are together, this is what i love about him but is it worthing the troubles or is it better living in an easy and comfortable life of lies?
I did both during this two holidaies and i should admit i enjoyed both in different ways... one for the comfort and the other one for the high and love.
I dont know what to do... is it better going on with a life of lies?
Im just scarry about what it could be in future... im already an apathetic asshole, i wont being worse!
Im scarry to being a dad, i hope a great really great dad, and when my kids i will turn into sixty i will tell them ""daddy always lied to you but i still love you... i would be an horrible father. 

ah, his situation isnt so different:him too never being ito men(im usually a womanizer)."

rt05lr,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/rt05lr/i_hate_the_internet/,I hate the internet.,15,8,1640975444.0,"I’m diagnosed with NPD and BPD. My therapist refers to me as a “vulnerable narcissist”. My therapist always explains things in ways that make sense, and also doesn’t hurt me when she explains my bad traits. But the internet does not and it’s always getting me down about who I am. Nobody in my life besides my family knows of my diagnoses, and when I look up things about narcissism so much of it says stuff like, “Narcissism is a challenging personality type for many to deal with, however the narcissist themself often doesn’t believe there are any issues with having this personality style”. I think most people actually diagnosed with NPD are very much aware there’s issues with our personalities. 

Also the “empath” v “narcissist” narrative is so tiring and triggering to me. I’m not sure why people think NPD doesn’t occur on a spectrum like every other personality disorder and be so rude to us based on the fact they think their ex is a “narcissist” so I’m going to be the worst person they’ve ever met as well. It’s funny to me because as a person with both of these diagnoses, I talk to my therapist about the empathy I feel and we help it come out more together. I know I feel empathy, and to see people who are generally all about mental health telling me narcissists simply can never feel these things is so exhausting."

I've been trying my best to be a better person, especially at socializing, building relationships, respecting other people, etc... All the things that NPDs are having difficulties with. 

Well, I failed spectacularly this year, but I've only been aware of NPD for a few months now, so cut me some slack :) I made a lot of progress and I'm happy with how my recovery is going so far.

Question: do you have any general advice on EVERYTHING regarding socializing, respecting boundaries etc.? 

I'm looking for resources like ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"". Books, podcasts, blogs, your general advice... Anything goes. 

I'm asking here, because you guys know the difficulties of NPD, so you will probably point me to resources that will make me productive. I need advice tailored to our ""personality pattern"". 

Give me the best shit only. 

Thank you, and Happy New Year 2022!"

Idk if I should tell my classmates about it so they understand why im weird and harsh sometimes…NPD never crossed my mind, I don’t brag about my achievements (because I have none lmao) and I dislike being the center of attention, though now I get why I kinda drove most of my relationships to the grave.

Basically I only started to match the traits of NPD since my bipolar disorder diagnosis at 19 (21 now). Although I have at times before it had some traits, related to growing up fairly lucky and never really having a financial struggle. My parents aren’t narcissists. I have had 2 manic episodes, and following the first I felt like I was just a worse person. After the second in September I feel worse, like empty. And not in a sad depressed way. Empty in that I just don’t feel normal, I don’t feel loving, I just feel like I’ve completely lost that healthy instinct in me to care about people, to not just always get but to give back. I could go on and on about my rage, manipulation, etc. but I’ll save you details as I’m more interested if it’s normal for a narcissist to remember a past where they were good people (and not just to get what they want, being genuinely good). It’s frustrating cuz 2 psychiatrists have said they don’t think I have NPD, but it just doesn’t make sense cuz my behavior doesn’t change for the better, despite self reflection and knowing I’ve done bad things. I just feel like maybe they don’t know everything cuz sometimes I forget details with psychiatrists. I just want to be my old self. I used to know how to love, and I used to know how to be good, I used to have the instinct, that feeling inside - now I just feel like a selfish robot with no true ability to change. I can’t even talk to people, strangers, anymore - it’s like I literally don’t know how and I’m blinded by insecurity and feeling imperfect. I have lost pretty much all my friends since I was 18-19. I only have my best friend who sometimes I feel like I’ve lost love for, and I just feel jealousy about. He doesn’t think I’m a narcissist but then again he doesn’t know the extent to my selfish manipulation because I was too ashamed to tell. My parents who are the victims in this don’t believe I’m a narcissist but they also no little about it despite me telling them and sending articles. Despite all these people not believing me to be a narcissist I can’t help but think I am, it just fits too perfectly - especially in the way that I recognize my shitty behaviour but then a second later just do it again. The worst part is looking back to when I feel normal. It’s like I look at those past memories before my 2nd year at university like a dog looking out the window watching their owner leave all sad. I just wish I could go back"
rsdrpm,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/rsdrpm/vehicle_for_hatred/,Vehicle for Hatred,10,6,1640902449.0,"Sometimes I feel like I am a vehicle of hell and hate. It's gotten to the point where that's all I really feel. 

Fear, anger, jealousy, and lust but that's not really an emotion in my book, just a need to release something and let my thoughts melt away and get horny tunnel vision for a few minutes until its replaced with cold sickness. I have a need for violence. Orgasmic fast violence, to myself and others. My head impacting with some hard red object at the speed of an ejaculation, my teeth embedding themselves in it and ripping out of my mouth leaving a hilarious gummy open mouth smile, my eyeballs embedding themselves too but they stay attached to the socket so when my head rushes back from the sheer force of it they stretch back. Its happens so fast that everything overlaps each other like frames in a cartoon, it happens in the blink of an eye. I can see it clearly. There's an orange sky behind me. And I'm smiling. When I think of that I feel a little loose in my legs, brings a little shiver to my spine, it's the kick I need, it brightens my day. Maybe if I was more violent I'd be more close to myself. If I lost everything, every bit of self control, and slammed someones head into a wall I would wake up from my coma. Just one violent act would make everything make sense. I'd break down crying. 

Does anyone else indulge themselves in success fantasies that titillate them but then when you think too long about them, they start to become terrifying? Does anyone else feel like they'd be happier if they just accepted being a loser and stopped chasing things, but also stopped relying on other people for anything? Disappear from the people you know and love and the people who's eyes you imagine when they are not near you, go somewhere where no one knows you or there is no one there to know you, stop talking to others and overtime stop talking to yourself and then just, blip. In the nothing, the big white light in your head will sink down to the size of a slowly spinning, small pulsing dying star, and then it will sink down more and more and more until it disappears. 

And then you'll walk out of the forest and you won't remember a thing about yourself, you won't remember a thing about your past or your present or your future, you won't understand those concepts to begin with, you won't know words or bodies or actions, you won't know and you won't care. You will walk out, and your mind will start over. Unmolded. And on the way back to nothing, you'll be molded only by the woods you walk through. And it will heal you and it will build you stronger walls. 

 Cover yourself in dirt and shit and grime. Being nothing feels like the only way to be happy. 

I don't want to lobotomize myself anymore.

And frequently being open with parents and close friends about their insecurities related to that worry of narcissism, feeling like a loser with no social skills unable to talk to people and have conversation and connect, social anxiety, feeling like they’re ugly, and being frustrated that it feels like they aren’t loving and for some reason never learn from mistakes, genuinely feeling like they’re bad and it haunts them everyday to the point where the thoughts are debilitating. It’s like a recognition of potential narcissism, recognizing habits and pain that’s being caused, but then failing to change. Biggest fear/insecurity being that the brain is permanently altered and that it wasn’t always like this. A big thing is frustrated at feeling normal and caring in the not so distant past  Edit: forgot to add the actual npd related stuff - consistent manipulation, feeling like I never learn, laziness, constantly making things about me or never going out of my way to do things, feeling unloving, expecting things to happen even though I don’t work hard. And getting mad at parents for example when I don’t get what I want. The thing is not too long ago maybe 3-4 years ago I didn’t feel like this at all really. Maybe a bit but I was social, I had friends, I worked hard in school, I was loving towards my parents. And I do feel love toward them it just feels like maybe superficial now. There’s other NPD stuff but I can’t remember everything. I also feel like I struggle with empathy, and don’t feel hurt when others Around me hurt - that’s one of my biggest insecurities I tell my parents.

======

Dr Kostas Papageorgiou, from Queen’s school of psychology, published new research, led by Queen’s University Belfast, its published in the journal of ""Personality and Individual Differences and European Psychiatry"".

New research found the **personality trait can actually lead to mental “toughness”, feeling less stressed and being less vulnerable to depression than other people**.

Dr Papageorgiou said: “The **results from all the studies that we conducted show that grandiose narcissism correlates with very positive components of mental toughness, such as confidence and goal-orientation, protecting against symptoms of depression and perceived stress**.

“While of course not all dimensions of narcissism are good, **certain aspects can lead to positive outcomes**.

So there you go, we ""might"" actually enjoy a sort of mental toughness that is rare, and act cool under stress, and over-confident at work and in life, and don't those around us just LOVE IT (and use it to the max)!"

This is the REASON you find LOADS of bad material on ""narc abuse/victims"" and NOTHING that speaks to the normal narcs with some traits, nothing speaks ""to them"" as human beings, as ones who deserve a chance at self improvement! This is even apparent from many posts here asking about sources..

Those with NPD (the clinical version) and with out-of-control symptoms are less than 1% of the population, way less, so most probably you're not one of them (they don't even admit they have anything to start with!).

Even with narc traits, you might be very well achieving and above-average (read about adaptive/healthy narcissism), so you should actually be proud (really, no sarcasm here)..

What we’re looking for is an “attachment injury.” Attachment injuries are part of what causes narcissism. Usually, it’s attachment injury + temperament. For me, my dad left me at age 3 for 3 months to work in the U.S., and then I immigrated to the U.S. at age 7 (both attachment injuries) on top of that, I was born with a horrible temperament - I could NOT self soothe when my mom dropped me off for school trips. 

To name some more concrete examples, a lot of kids of people in the army have narcissism bc they move around a lot. Notably, moving to China at age 7 is an attachment injury Kanye West had that led him to have narcissism. That and his parents divorcing. 

My source is partly the Psychology in Seattle podcast. 


This is important to call out bc a lot of narcissists with trauma cling to that to justify their actions or personality. No justifying. Regardless of how we got this, we need to just to the boring work of trying hard to think of others."

Does anyone know someone who has achieved this ""enlightenment"" to escape the narcissistic cage?  Or is it a lifetime condition?

On the other hand, most narcs live with this NPD survival mechanism and shouldn't even attempt to change... because they are fine and feel empowered as they are. They take whatever they want, they discard what doesn't work for them and move on faster with their lives. Not sure if there's contentment in the long run, but it works for the time being on earth.

rqlydt,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/rqlydt/vent/,Vent,2,4,1640715329.0," I posted an insta story asking if anyone would like to invite me to a/their Sylvester party.. well 30 ppl read it and I got no answer. To add to that I'm the kid who never gets invited anywhere, an I mean NEVER. Growing up I've never had a friend group, now I have no one that I feel emotionally close to. Also the fact that they do this partying  and friendship thing implies that they're better than me which is something I can NOT let happen. 

Like wtf am I doing wrong? I don't look bad, I maintain proper hygiene and I'm smart, smarter than kost of them (IQ) and I act friendly towards everyone and even pretend to care about what they're saying. So why am I always the worst or the last choice or simply the girl that gets overlooked?
And honestly, I don't know I should feel about that: I've already thought about multiple scenarios that I could initiate:

1. I pretend to be very mentally unwell (which I am btw) and thus score sympathy points just like I tried from the 7th grade on where I was considering jumping out of the window and having the fantasy that someone would stop me and everyone would dramatically gather around me and shower me with apologies and sympathy.... but it didn't work so I'm not certain that it will this time

2. Isolation. Completely retreat from society and play the 'mysterious loner' that means on new years eve I'll go into the city on my own, buy myself a bottle of wine and proceed to drink it while sitting sad on a bench or something. I'd start going to the gym again and maybe they'll finally pay attention when I look better than all of them (now I'm about half way there) Like why do I not have a boyfriend? I'm skinny, have visible abs and my face is not that bad too but for some reason I've never even had my first kiss. Plus hearing people rank about whom they've already made out with at my age makes my blood boil, like 'why does this not happen to me' and 'now I am even lower on the social hierarchy and look even worse in front of everyone'
Also btw am somewhat incompetent at maintaining relationships since idk what the hell people talk about. Is it life experiences? Too bad, because I remember almost nothing before 10th grade (13years). Like how do people keep that up? I seriously wanna know? Because in one hand, my therapist told me that affective empathy is only possible if you like yourself, even though a lot of people dont like themselves and they still got friends somehow. Hell, some don't even deserve the amount of friends they have which means at even those who are much less worth than me still have a better social life.

3. Revenge: The amount of anger I feel is pretty high ngl, which is kinda weird because I feel both like I can't feel any anger but then at the same time I have the urge to tell them to just go fuck themselves and get revenge for what they've done which may make them fear me which in return finally gives me some ounce of respect and maybe then ppl will start to associate with me.
Because for some reason I don't care about emotional intimacy, because you can just fake it and because I know that that'll never happen to me lol and the othe. And furthermore friendships or specifically having a social life kinda builds this image of yourself in which you are worth something because you're somewhat high in the social hierarchy which ofc makes you look good and thus you're better than other (which is like my only legitimate goal in life, to be better than those people I come in contact with and yes it's unrealistic but still, can't allow myself to be worse no matter which aspect of life lmaooo)

Holy damn this was long.. if you made it to here: wow you're bored/ but also thank you cause I feel that this is the only place where I can vent my thoughts that some would probably understand . 

FYI IM NOT CLINICALLY DIAGNOSED!! I just feel like almost everything in this the most relatable shit I've heard lol so// also because I'm a minor too

And I’m almost sure I don’t have NPD since I can’t relate to 100% of anything about its symptoms but I won’t straight up say I don’t have it because I don’t want to be “that person”. I’ve been a victim of narcissistic abuse before and have been routinely gaslight throughout my life and relationships so I’m weary of what I’m told and whatnot.

My husband wanted to show me a youtube video on the differences between traditional narcissism and covert/non-traditional narcissism specifically for the covert narcissist section that explains their traits (to which he later explained) because I’m friends with someone who carries those traits and I could never really pinpoint what exactly felt off about them and why they did the things they did.

In the video (it was a Dr K video, he’s the psychiatrist on Twitch), 1 of the many traits/symptoms of the covert narcissist is “reassurance”, and my husband pointed out that I tend to ask for reassurance sometimes which in his words “is a narcissistic trait”. I explained to him that my need for reassurance comes from a place of abandonment and trust issues, and that for example my reassurance 97% of the time is when I say something like: “Are you mad at me?”,  because I’m genuinely worried he is mad at me sometimes and it’s not “just to say it”; in my relationship with him it sometimes feels like I’m walking on eggshells because I need to be careful what I say or do in order to not upset him depending on how his mood is, because when he does get angry/frustrated it can get really bad (not physical, just verbal).

He claimed I was being defensive when I calmly explained to him I did not think it is a narc tendency or that it comes from a place of narc (as if it’s implied I am a narc) and he said he wasn’t downright calling me a narcissist or that the tendency is inherently narcissistic. I had trouble understanding the term “narc tendency” as well since it wasn’t explained properly. I kind of started doubting and questioning myself afterwards that it may very well be a narc tendency and asked him again his thoughts on what he claimed and he said “I don’t know if it’s a narc tendency or if it comes from a narc place I just wanted to say that”, and I started to have anxiety because it just felt like he planted a seed of doubt in my head; I suffer from CPTSD, OCD, ADHD, ASD, (and possibly schizo-affective/psychosis due to a cannabis-induced psychosis I had last year) and it just gave me a full-blown anxiety attack.

I’ve had times where I’ve asked myself before if I was a narcissist and I’m actually not an empath even when I feel a lot for others, mainly because of my issues concerning reality. I’m seeing a therapist and psychiatrist at the moment and I’m going to tell them about this but my appointment is so far and I’ve just been up all night worrying about this and kinda freaking out so that’s why I’m coming on here to ask for a third-party opinion.

I told my husband how that seed of doubt kinda messed me up and although frustrated he apologized and said that he didn’t mean to. Other things happened and topics were discussed that I might touch on later, but that’s pretty much what happened and I’m questioning my reality right now and pretty much my whole life."

Found this subreddit recently and thought I'd share my story(maybe some will find similarities or it'd be interesting to hear)

I am a guy with who has been diagnosed with OCD for the last 5 years,  but living without knowing it for 15. I was always sensitive kid who wanted to be accepted in society and was greatly loved by parents(however love at home never translated into acceptance between my peers, i was bullied & when I was not I still felt like I had to play a character to fit in)

From 10 years old whenever I'd get stressed at school or social situations - I'd put sharp things under my fingernails(toothpicks, needles). It made me feel physical pain  but that put my mind away from thinking about what i did wrong, why do others don't like me and why the world is such a bad place.

At the time I didn't know,  but it was start of getting my mind of intrusive thoughts with compulsions. Over time, as my environment changed and I had more experiences - My OCD was growing with me too. Sharp things under fingernails compulsion grew with junk food, alcohol, social media scrolling, cigarettes as new additions to compulsions and not being accepted intrusive thoughts grew with People don't like me, I am not doing what I should be doing, I am living meaningless life obsessions.

However, I managed to hide it enough so people thought I was living a normal life. Reason is that I found my way to cope with all this - I will put in every acticity that I do 100% so ai become the best, hence no one can make me feel insecure and worry about my place in life. Surprisingly enough, this approach works on some scenarios when I have energy to spend. However, when I get tired or something is not going up to plan(basically any bigger negative scenario) intrusive thoughts come back and then I fall into compulsions. At my lowest point, 4 days of my week were spent trying to be the best at everything I do,  the other 3 were spent doing compulsions and thinking that I don't want to live. And get this, when I was doing compulsions with people(drinking) I still wanted to be best and show that I can party better than them.


I have many crazy stories of how compulsions were fucking up my life :D One time after big drinking binge I woke up at my houselord's place because i have lost all my belongings(turns out I went to some hotel with stranger group to celebrate after bars closed, blacked out and in the morning didn't even remember the hotel). The other time I woke up on the grass near my flat without any belongings(it was 30 degrees outside, I was walking for 10hrs in the city without water, sleeping on benches and waited for my parents to give me my keys, now Its funny then I though I was gonna die). Things like  drinking binges,  ordering 10 different types of junk food over one evening and overeating until I get sick, smoking until I vomit and putting sharp things until I bleed were common week days. It got to a point where I couldn't work, I had to call in sick a lot due to me not being able to physically work, I moved to my parents because I couldn't cope alone and when they saw the state I am in it was the last straw. I realised help is needed fast.


Fastforward 10months......

Thanks to psychoterapy and SSRI's,  I am able to somewhat control what I do and how do I respond to these feelings but we should always seek help..I honestly feel I could've ended myself if I kept playing into intrusive thoughts everytime."

I can’t stand feeling jealousy!!! 

I’m not that jealous of other peoples appearances but it’s like other people are probably attracted to someone else over me.. you get me?

Like I can’t stand seeing someone who I probably don’t have a chance with (if I’m the opposite of their type for example).

It makes me BOIL! I get so angry and get this burning feeling in my chest. Please give me some tips, mediations etc ANYTHING

Jealousy is that one feeling I wish I could remove"

I don’t know why, I love to over share but still not over share, you know?

I just want people close to me to fucking understand that it’s exhausting for me to act like I care that they got a new job, it’s exhausting to answer their damn questions all the time just shut the fuck up and support me and my life, give me validation and make me feel wanted!!

I’ve never vented so much in my life, I feel so good now

But I’m just gonna say I have depression because apparently NPD is for evil people"

And maybe this is the entitlement talking but I dont wanna work so hard to be a good person or to get help. Seems the only way to not hurt others is to just isolate yourself. When I'm around others it's very hard to control my narcissism. I wanna live a normal life like other young people. Plus I feel ""depressed"" and dont even know where to start.  And I feel I dont have time to work on myself plus I dont even know how

Edit: I cant handle rejection even if I know things would never work out and persons not right for me. It makes me feel like a failure"

What's your story?,7,10,1640553927.0,"When I found out about NPD, it explained a lot of things, yet I could never 100% relate, usually because  narcs are often depicted as loud, obnoxious people who constantly belittle others. My NPD dad is also guilty of this, and compared to him I was alway much more discreet.

But recently I found out about _covert_ narcissism and everything makes so much more sense. I could especially relate to how covert narcs have a ""mask"" for being around people and can be very different with friends close to them, usually in a negative way. I never even really realized I did this until I read about it.

This got me thinking...how many narcissists are out there who got misdiagnosed because they are covert? How did you get diagnosed if you're a covert narc?"
rp63jj,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/rp63jj/nobody_understands/,Nobody understands,6,3,1640553809.0,"I tell lies and cover things up by trying to be the “normal person” in my family, to create the image I think they want to see. I said I finished my degree when I didn’t because of depression, they came to toast me only to find out later I was lying. I lie about my successes all the time. I pretend to be morally in line with them but I’m not. I lie, I steal, I cheat, I take things when offered, I am by no means the person they want me to be. They are in total denial about my PD and think it’s “just an influence” from a bad choice of people and drugs. But this is me! Since early teens!
They’re always throwing money at me and the situation, emotionally binding contracts from my mother seem to make her think she can keep me in line at 25. Money is used as a leverage. Not in a controlling way, but an I LOVE YOU SO MUCH I HAVE THE RIGHT TO SMOTHER YOU way. I’m finally realising I need to break free of all the bullshit that makes me feel obligated and make my own decisions.

Tldr: I just feel like such an outcast. I’m always masking to protect people and they end up seeing it as selfish and deceitful when all I’m trying to do is keep people happy."

I almost can't find answers to questions about getting better without seeing ""how to recover from NPD abuse in a relationship"" ""Narcissist are monsters who feel nothing"". I'm even in a FB group for NPD recovery and most of the posts are either trashing people with NPD or people with NPD being very stereotypical. 

My question is, I hate that I'm this way and I see others do too. Can we get better? Why are we overlooked in the mental health community and society? I've read horror stories of psychs saying oh I can't treat that. I personally had a counselor tell me I didn't have BPD bc I'm a male and have never attempted suicide. 

For me, it hurts seeing us cast aside as worthless and untreatable. Maybe it is me being a Narcissist, but I think we deserve understanding. It took a good person to tell me I needed help and that maybe I had this but pointed out the possible causes and ability to get better. I'm forever grateful as I start a journey with hopefully a capable psych next month. 

Sorry I got off topic a lot"
