hq9q19r,t3_rqd445,"Narcissist or not, leaking is always a risk when you send nudes. We're not a hivemind and I personally wouldn't do it, but motivations could be bragging or revenge. You can only wait to see how it plays out and get the police involved if necessary. You may be interested in looking into ""reverse image search"" to check if they've leaked, but keep in mind that search engines can keep a copy of the uploaded image.

Since this is a support sub for people who have NPD and posts by non-narcissists are sometimes deleted, I recommend bringing you questions to /r/AskNPD.",t3_rqd445

hq9j3nx,t3_rqd445,"Any kind of blackmailing, call 911. NPD  is insecure; do not fall in the trap of blackmailing; even you can get a warrant; it is your reputation and to stop such behavior, act smart!",t3_rqd445
hqdr36q,t3_rqd445,"Personally I don’t think so. Trust me, every time someone hurts my ego I seek revenge on anyway possible except those that may end up with me on serious trouble, and this would be one of them. Narcissists ain’t machines, we still know some behaviors needed to be a “functional” member of society. Not breaking the law is definitely one of those.",t3_rqd445

hq9kjnq,t1_hq9j3nx,I second this. Let the police handle that if he threatens you.,t3_rqd445
hqeh2z0,t1_hqdr36q,I wish he is the same but not all narcs are the same. If he is that careless to hurt my feelings he could be careless about leaking my vdos too. I dont trust his words anymore.,t3_rqd445
