hqemypj,t3_rqxqmb,"I think the biological aspect of NPD is neglected quite a lot. 

Genetics seems to be quite important - oxytocin for example is the key ingredient for empathy and a sense of self, as well as emotional regulation and enforcing positive social interactions.",t3_rqxqmb
hqe45c1,t3_rqxqmb,"+1 to moving a lot.

Parents got divorced before I was 2.

I moved like 6-7 times before I was 15. 

Shit my pants when I was 8. Dr. Elinor Greenberg has an article about NPD and shit. 

Contemptuous mother, aggressive and pseudo-authoritarian father did it for me.",t3_rqxqmb
hqe0bxh,t3_rqxqmb,"More like these sorts of posts reek of internalised stigma.

Inner child work is valid.

Also, I don't see many people on here clinging to trauma to justify the actions. I actually haven't seen one post like that.",t3_rqxqmb
hqeokcm,t3_rqxqmb,"I'm also of the opinion that, at least in my case, it's more of a temperament thing.

I think I was born with extreme sensitivity to external evaluation, negative emotion, and low emotional awareness. Someday I want to scan my brain to make sure but I'm 99% sure that I have a big amygdala and shitty prefrontal cortex circuitry.

Because of my temperament, I could have benefited from a more emotionally-aware education. But my parents are not psychologists and it's not my parents' (or anybody's) fault that I processed normal stimuli the way I did.

In this post I talk about environmental things I think contributed to my narcissism: https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/rq8ip9/what_are_the_main_traumas_that_led_someone_to/hq9vzx4/",t3_rqxqmb
hqfxqxg,t3_rqxqmb,"Why aren't both concepts equally valid at the same time? Inner parts work is one of the most effective modalities that I know and it's often used in a way that it integrates attachment theory, which I find to be the most useful approach. By re-parenting your inner child you're aiming to heal the attachment wounds by providing the need that has been so severely neglected. For narcissists, this has often been severe neglect rather than severe enmenshment because they often haven't received any mirroring at all rather than constant positive or negative mirroring (of course this is a generalization). Also, even if temparament plays a huge role it has to be enhanced by reinforcement through the parent's or primary attachment figures. Here, trauma psychology comes into play which states that there are different ways to respond to trauma - fight, flight, freeze or fawn. Narcissists are the ones where none of these options worked for soothing the abusers and making it stop. For example codependents are the ones where the ""fawn"" response worked very well for them to at least gain some control over the abuse because being nice, apologizing and helping made mommy and daddy react less angry. Narcissists on the other hand are the ones who were rather ignored completely or punished for acting nice. Potentially the fight response worked better for them so they learned they could have themselves but not others at the same time, so they sacrificed having close emotional relationships.",t3_rqxqmb
hql1cjy,t3_rqxqmb,"Moved around constantly, I think I moved around 7-8 times by the time I was 18. One of those moves was when I was a toddler, I was moved from Florida to Connecticut, from my mother to my sister + her gf, and my sister wasn't around a lot.",t3_rqxqmb
hqd6527,t3_rqxqmb,Yes! Inner child shit is such a holy cow around here. Glad someone shattered that shit,t3_rqxqmb
hqhatu4,t3_rqxqmb,"My dad is insane, refuses to takes his meds and replaced them with smoking/drinking.

My parents got divorced when I was little and due to the custody agreement I had to spend weekends with him. He's nuts and would either beat me up or get crazy ideas into his head and tamper with my food / deprive me from sleep.

I learnt at a young age to cut people off emotionally and to be manipulative to still get money out of him while keeping him at a safe distance. 

My dad is trash. He's had multiple girlfriends over the years and you can see their mental health go downhill while they are together.",t3_rqxqmb
hqhyotn,t1_hqemypj,"bro dont worry about oxytocin, and its quite literally the fact that there were more vital things than the kids emotions causing the kid to believe emotions arent what matters",t3_rqxqmb

hqi3myu,t1_hqhyotn,"I don't think it should be ignored, whether you believe in biological determinism or not, it has research behind it. Every condition has a biological element.",t3_rqxqmb
