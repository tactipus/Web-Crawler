hqoasv1,t3_rssbtz,"Our ego is just as a wild horse needed guidance, discipline and love. Please try to have compassion with yourself, shit happens all the time. Sometimes you win, sometimes you loose.",t3_rssbtz
hqo9s11,t3_rssbtz,Hopefully it'll pass in a few days. üíò,t3_rssbtz
hqoo8cm,t3_rssbtz,"Were you able to deduce a reason for ghosting you? How far in the relationship were you with this person?

Sometimes people make us the favor of removing themselves from our lives",t3_rssbtz
hqp30zp,t3_rssbtz,"Some comments are saying it was ""karma"" or asking what you did.

You got ghosted. You didn't do a single thing. Nothing to your knowledge at least. Don't put the burden of the relationship ending on yourself. The pain will past. You're suffering a huge narcissistic injury. It will be very very hard, but you need to NOT hate the person (or yourself), and try to accept what happened and let the anger go. 

I want you to open up a notepad and write down 5 things you BENEFITED from from your relationship. Something you learned about yourself, something you gained, or anything else.",t3_rssbtz
hqon5dr,t3_rssbtz,"be kind to yourself if no one else will be to you

edit: i didnt make a typo im perfect",t3_rssbtz
hqovnli,t3_rssbtz,"sorry this is happening to you, OP. you don't deserve it and always remember, don't be ashame to call a friend or your therapist right away if it becomes unbearable üíò",t3_rssbtz
hqp33qf,t3_rssbtz,Been there left me in bed for2 weeks straight . Fucking hell. I‚Äôm sorry :(,t3_rssbtz
hqp5lnm,t3_rssbtz,"distract yourself man. go out with other people, do stuff you like. try not to think about it, you'll get through it, as much as it sucks.",t3_rssbtz
hqol69o,t3_rssbtz,"Karma is very appropriate here, because not only is the op expressing upset at being ghosted , the op is admitting that they would have done it or wanted to do it first.  Hence karma .  what goes around comes around.   My comment was one word, and all the comments responding to that word is  revealing the fears and beliefs of the people who are commenting on that one  word.    ask yourself why?",t3_rssbtz
hqog5kx,t3_rssbtz,Karma,t3_rssbtz
hqpvx5z,t3_rssbtz,"This is pathetic and quite possibly the worst piece of shit thread I‚Äôve ever seen on this cringy rat infested sub, I hope nobody ends up in a close relationship with you for their own sake because you honestly seem like you‚Äôre a person who only causes problems in other people‚Äôs lives. Grow the fuck up",t3_rssbtz
hqpnq4h,t3_rssbtz,Karma,t3_rssbtz
hqpwvq9,t3_rssbtz,Two narcissists meet each other in the wild. This is the result.,t3_rssbtz
hqqwe2b,t3_rssbtz,"Yeah we can't have that shit. If it even looks like someone is trynna ghost us, we throw it back asap or spin a tale. üòè",t3_rssbtz
hqrmo5l,t3_rssbtz,"Dude I got ghost this year too, and what angers me the most is that he didn‚Äôt even OPEN my last message. Like it‚Äôs still on delivered ‚Äî he has read receipts on. What helped me is knowing that if they ghosted, that means they weren‚Äôt all the way in it to begin. It‚Äôs not like the ‚Äúchanged their mind.‚Äù",t3_rssbtz
hqpvspv,t1_hqp5lnm,"doing this rn. starting to get over it, usually takes me a few days. will update.",t3_rssbtz
hqp17rl,t1_hqol69o,"This page is for showing compassion towards narcissists, as crazy as that sounds. However to anyone who is a narcissist it is not your fault. Karma may be appropriate but I doubt they will see it that way. My guess is that the person who ghosted noticed narcissistic tendencies and withdrew themselves from their life, otherwise they would have been destroyed by the narc.",t3_rssbtz
hqojadq,t1_hqog5kx,having npd doesn't inherently make someone deserving of bad karma.,t3_rssbtz
hqoglsy,t1_hqog5kx,"This isn‚Äôt karma, it‚Äôs just life. If the concept of karma actually had merit then everything would be much more simple. But it‚Äôs not. And it never will be.",t3_rssbtz
hqoisvx,t1_hqog5kx,by your logic people ghosted by narcs are experiencing karma lmao,t3_rssbtz
hqstac5,t1_hqp17rl,Sometimes the most compassionate thing you can say is the most honest thing.,t3_rssbtz
hqp1ypd,t1_hqp17rl,"Compassion? Supporting this is downright enabling bad behavior.

But whatever I ghost people all the time when they get on my nerves lol",t3_rssbtz
hqpadwx,t1_hqojadq,"Simply having npd doesn‚Äôt make you a bad person, but if you are a narc an act selfishly without any regard for hurting people it does. If you hurt someone due to a personality disorder, you‚Äôre still hurting someone.",t3_rssbtz
hqojqvy,t1_hqojadq,"Ahhh you see but I didn't say bad karma,  I just said karma , you see it as "" bad"".    Is all karma bad? No.",t3_rssbtz
hqohfwg,t1_hqoglsy,Right an NPD would not like even the idea of karma. üòä,t3_rssbtz
hqoktnu,t1_hqoisvx,"No that's your logic, my comment was one word,  you're adding all of this by yourself.",t3_rssbtz
hqtil1u,t1_hqstac5,"I agree with that, honesty is compassionate. A lot of people avoid honesty because they‚Äôre afraid of the confrontation and what conflict they may spark. The truth no matter how painful will help you stay on the right path.",t3_rssbtz
hqp9rvh,t1_hqp1ypd,"I agree enabling bad behaviour is only gonna result in worse behaviour. Once again it‚Äôs not the narcissist fault that they‚Äôre a narc, but that‚Äôs not an excuse. There are some perks to being a narc i.e. they tend to make more money, however it is unfortunate to rely on external validation and having a fragile ego. Also a narc more than likely will destroy people around them, and of course I don‚Äôt support that. Do I have compassion for narcs, not really. I do feel a sense of pity and if I knowingly encountered one, I‚Äôd run for my life to protect my mental health.",t3_rssbtz
hqpajbi,t1_hqpadwx,obviously. but that is not the case in this scenario,t3_rssbtz
hqokdpq,t1_hqojqvy,"you can stop being condescending, it is not making you look smart. your point was clearly implied. op said something bad happened, you said it was karma.",t3_rssbtz
hqoig2z,t1_hqohfwg,"I may not like the idea of karma, that‚Äôs correct. But it doesn‚Äôt mean that karma exists. 
Manifestation certainly exists, the idea in which we create what we focus/revolve our lives around; which could be mistaken for karma, but karma itself as a concept is a far fetched one.",t3_rssbtz
hqolc9m,t1_hqoktnu,nope that's yours lol ÿå narcs being ghosted is karma and normal people getting ghosted is what ? lmaoooo eveyone gets ghosted.,t3_rssbtz
hqvarul,t1_hqtil1u,Thank you üíï,t3_rssbtz
hqpbflo,t1_hqpajbi,"The OP said they would have ghosted them first. They would afflict that same bruising of the ego onto that other person. Yes I don‚Äôt think the OP is sinister for wanting to do that, but it does display selfish traits.",t3_rssbtz
hqoknyo,t1_hqokdpq,"Bad is in the eyes of the experiencer, all I said was one word, your adding so much to it, but the more you add,  the more you reveal your own fears and beliefs.",t3_rssbtz
hqr14i3,t1_hqolc9m,"That's just trusting the wrong people.   If it's one thing I noticed,  narcissists think lowly of people who interact with them in any humane way, yet complain how people only want to use them, or how everyone hates them.   Narcissists ghosting people is just them showing their contempt for anyone foolish enough to think there was any good in them.  If anything the person ghosted is experiencing karma because they mistook evil for good.  You are not supposed to do that.",t3_rssbtz
