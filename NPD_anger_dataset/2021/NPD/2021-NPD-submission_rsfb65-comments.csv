hqqgwb5,t3_rsfb65,"Didn't read your post since it's a fucking book, only the title. I will say this though. Narcissism isn't a disorder you are born with. Usually the symptoms begin to show in teenage years. Narcissism is made from being neglected or if you didn't get teached about boundaries in your childhood. Narcissism isn't curable, it can never go away. You can change your behavior and actively try to be a good person. But the mind has already been 'shaped' 'programmed' like a narcissist.

I'm not a psychologist nor a psychiatrist. I am an expert on narcissism and I'm fit to answer the question.",t3_rsfb65
hqsiht2,t3_rsfb65,"I find my npd is much better when i'm in a good situation (when im happy, have people who accept me for who i am and give me healthy supply). I become much worse when i'm in a bad situation (no job, no friends, no girlfriend etc) and am unhappy/stressed out etc",t3_rsfb65
hqqi56i,t1_hqqgwb5,"Thanks for the reply and yeah I figured not many word read something this long. It might’ve been slightly unclear what I meant also in the title. I meant like I don’t feel normal rn, but up until 18 I felt pretty normal, and had no issues, and I can distinctly remember the feelings and memories of when I didn’t feel like a narcissist. There were always things in those 18 years that weren’t normal, like some fantasies of “making it” in screenwriting, but I was for the most part normal, never manipulative, felt like I was likable despite being shy and awkward, had lots of feeling of genuine love and appreciation, and had several friends (I only really have 1 now). Overall since my bipolar diagnosis my narcissistic thoughts and behavior have progressively gotten worse. 2 psychiatrists have said I don’t have it but I still have the overwhelming feeling that I do given that they didn’t make much of an effort to pry, only really responded to my concern and the “evidence” I gave. Sorry for long response, I understand if you don’t read. It just feels like my past is mocking me, and I’ll never get that feeling of normalcy back",t3_rsfb65
hqqjvpv,t1_hqqi56i,"I'm not very educated on bipolar disorder, but what I figured out from the text is that you felt like a normal person up until you turned 18 years old. It is highly unlikely you have NPD since symptoms should occur at the ages of 15-16 years old. At 18 years old, your brain is almost completely developed and can't get NPD. 

Although you may have confused your narcissism with something else. I would recommend that you speak to a therapist and really go in deep about you thoughts, behaviors and symptoms.",t3_rsfb65
