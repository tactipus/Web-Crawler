hqh9jxe,t3_rr49aq,"There's a [small study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23777939/) claiming that people with NPD have smaller gray matter volume in the left anterior insula (this is believed to be empathy-related).

In order to see this on your MRI, you'd probably need a contrast agent. An MRI with a contrast needs a doctor's approval. MRI with contrast is an invasive method of imagining and you may not get your doctor's referral.

Perhaps, you should look into functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). This is a non-invasive method of imaging and provides information on patterns of your brain's activity.

How difficult is it to get an appointment for a scan in an fMRI machine?

>Honestly it's not very difficult at all to get your brain scanned in an MRI/fMRI. Hell, often times you'll even get paid to do so. How? Participate in a research experiment!  
>  
>The easiest way is to find your nearest college or university and go to their psychology and/or neuroscience departmental websites.  
>  
>Those sites usually list the faculty working in that department. Find professors whose research focuses on human cognition and/or psychiatric illness as those are the ones who most likely use fMRI in their research.  
>  
>From there you can try emailing their lab manager, post-docs, or graduate students directly to see if they are looking for any volunteer research participants (emails are usually listed on the lab's ""people"" page or something similar).
