Because I suspect healing may be difficult in a codependent situation like that.",t3_rrgyyr

hqhxwdt,t1_hqhwtkb,"narcs have a tendency to be a win-all, and two narcs would get into a fight for win/lose, and it would end lose/lose; neither would step down. in psychology, getting two troubled souls together is a recipe for one big mess, so take care..",t3_rrgyyr

well said.. I'm a psychologist, and you got that right!",t3_rrgyyr
hqhwimm,t1_hqgayf3,sure but youre narcissistic for a reason,t3_rrgyyr
hqhz1yh,t1_hqhxwdt,"When you say ""Win All"" and ""Win Lose"" are you implying narcissistic people are unable to work with each other?

>in psychology, getting two troubled souls together is a recipe for one beg mess

Do you have a source for this? Seems like quite a blanket statement.",t3_rrgyyr
hqhykr6,t1_hqhwimm,"sure, but each to his own, if you know the reason and want to ""fix"" it, perfect!",t3_rrgyyr
hqhzpdq,t1_hqhz1yh,"Narcs, like any normal people in close relationships, can work out things, until they get messy, then its fight mode, and as a narc you know that mode very well, the ego comes into play, and it hurts..

As for the blanket statement, its 20 years of experience, I cannot point you to a source for each statement I make (sorry)..",t3_rrgyyr
hqid3pt,t1_hqhzpdq,"“20 years experience” isn’t enough for what you’re saying to be a fact. Believe it or not, some narcs don’t go all ape on other people after deep in a relationship. Sometimes you can work it out if you’re smart enough",t3_rrgyyr
hqju7au,t1_hqid3pt,"First you are correct; experience doesn't equal fact. I hope I was clear in expressing only an ""opinion"".

Smart, willing people, can do wonders in the worst of relationships, and get out brilliant results, I agree.

To cite something about how narcs might go together, see this scientific study titled: *I only like the idea of you: Narcissists tolerate others’ narcissistic traits but not their corresponding behaviors*.

August 2015 - Journal of Personality and Individual Differences - 82 DOI:10.1016/j.paid.2015.02.019

It concludes: In sum, the present research presents a case of ‘narcissistic hypocrisy’ – narcissists claim to be more forgiving of narcissistic traits but do not follow through with this claim when led to confront manifestations of these traits.

Hope that helps support my opinion.. 

All the best!",t3_rrgyyr
