Cheating ruins relationships beyond repair (in ref to your gf), and neither you nor your male lover seem in the right place for a long-term relationship. You say you’re in love, but is it because his infatuation satisfies your need for supply? Are you just going through the high of being in a new relationship? I don’t mean to invalidate your situation, I’m just trying to view it with your NPD in mind, which I know from personal experience can blind me from seeing what is ACTUAL love and what is just obsession/short-term bliss.",t3_rt8dcd
