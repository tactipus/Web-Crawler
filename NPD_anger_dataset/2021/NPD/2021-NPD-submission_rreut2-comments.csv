hqgzmto,t3_rreut2,"Overt will be proud of being a Narcissist, dunno about Covert

I personally tell everyone that I have NPD because it's cool. It's also the only thing about me that does not change",t3_rreut2
hqi7qz1,t3_rreut2,"I’m covert and I’m lost as hell. Well Since I’m aware that I have low self esteem I think the people around me has noticed it too which has created a depressing cloud over me.

I don’t wanna go to therapy because I know it won’t help, I want someone to get inside my head and change my delusions. I need to get control over my emotions or else I will burn bridges. 
And I HAVE to get higher self esteem or else I won’t succeed. And I’m lazy as a motherfucker

I think overt narcissists who are self aware are probably more delusional",t3_rreut2
hqsdlf8,t3_rreut2,"I’m overt and I don’t have a problem with the fact I have NPD, rather I think it’s like a superpower, an advantage I have over others who get attached easily, who let empathy cloud their judgement, who get hurt over anything and everything. It makes me more intellectual, funny, charming, appealing. 

That being said I am aware of my negative behaviors and I AM trying to change them when it comes to my relationships. Everyone else… I don’t give a shit. But I have someone in my life I care about for the first time and I don’t want to set them on fire just for being near me.

I imagine coverts however would see it as a shameful thing, something they fear telling people. They’d have a lot more negative self views because of the fact they have it.",t3_rreut2
hqj5hac,t3_rreut2,"I’ll definitely check out your book recommendation, it sounds really helpful! Yeah, I think my grief period lasted about the same amount of time as yours. I had to settle for crying and watching Disney movies instead of weed, but I definitely watched a ton of npd videos, too. Which at the time was kinda traumatising to be honest, cause so many people whitewash us as ‘evil’, when it’s not true. And pretty ironic, since it’s us who are supposed to be all about the black and white thinking.",t3_rreut2
hqphcu4,t3_rreut2,"I am overt and proud of it!! 
After have been bullied for years when i was younger, now i know what the real human nature is so i dont give a shit being seen as arrogant, haugty, proud etc… 
Like this people keep their distance with me and dont bother me, at least the ones i dont want around me.",t3_rreut2
hqh3v3a,t1_hqgzmto,"Yeah, as a covert, when I finally figured out what was wrong with me, I was hit with so much shame and emotional dysregulation. I think with coverts we have a lot to lose. At least in my experience as one, I was always told I was sensitive, empathetic and compassionate, and it stung a lot to be exposed to the cold hard truth that it’s fake and all part of an elaborate defence mechanism.",t3_rreut2
hqj4tlw,t1_hqi7qz1,"I know, it’s difficult because you just kinda want to take a magic pill that cures the npd, which unfortunately isn’t a thing. I would personally recommend therapy, even if you just aim to get help for low self esteem, because that can definitely help you exist with yourself in a more optimistic way. 

I’ve started doing positive affirmations with my therapist, which are definitely having an impact on how I feel within myself. So I guess even if you don’t go to therapy, you could try writing some positive affirmations (for example, one of mine is ‘I’m enough just the way I am’) in a notebook and read them once every day? It doesn’t take long, and you can do it in bed, if you are lazy (which I am too). 

Whatever you choose to do, I wish you the best of luck! I believe that we are capable of change, even if it is just a change in our coping mechanisms for the better, I think that has to count for something.",t3_rreut2
hqj1b91,t1_hqh3v3a,"Tbh, after becoming ""truly aware"", it felt like shit for a few months (5 or so). All I could do was stay at home, smoke weed, do drugs and watch vids on NPD. 

I knew I was over confident and full of myself since I was fucking 13. 38/40 on NPI when I was 17. I became ""truly aware"" when I realized that I'm psychotic and delusional, at the age of 24. That's the thing that hurt. ""I'm not half as sane as I thought.""

It gets better. I suggest u grab a copy of Dr Elinor Greenberg's book -- Borderline, Narcissistic and Schizoid Adaptations. She talks about this phase, calls it ""Paradise Lost"", says it lasts for a year, maybe. Best book.",t3_rreut2
