hq5uqle,t3_rpr2fz,Any paticular reason you are posting here? Idk how this is relevant to NPD?,t3_rpr2fz
hqe8j9b,t3_rpr2fz,"I have OCD and your descriptions seem off. You seem to be describing self-harm, addiction, impulsive (rather than compulsive) behaviour, and anxiety. Your description of intrusive thoughts are not accurate, also. You're describing anxious thoughts. 

Anyway, all the best.",t3_rpr2fz
hq6my2b,t1_hq5uqle,5th paragraph,t3_rpr2fz
hq6o4go,t1_hq6my2b,"Still confused, sorry. Do you have NPD? Do you think you have NPD?",t3_rpr2fz
hq73umd,t1_hq6o4go,"Diagnosed OCD, don't have diagnosed NPD. So I think I have NPD",t3_rpr2fz
hq79jc6,t1_hq73umd,"Alright, that is what I was worried about.

Do you know that a common OCD obsession is having a mental illness? Specifically NPD or other cluster B Personality Disorders?

It's so common that this sub frequently receives posts from pwOCD who are worried they have NPD; when in reality they don't. 

Have you talked to a professional about your concerns that you have NPD?",t3_rpr2fz
hq8gmuu,t1_hq79jc6,How would you even know that they don't have NPD?,t3_rpr2fz
hq8zty3,t1_hq8gmuu,"They don’t know for sure, just the fact of the matter is we frequently get people with OCD posting here thinking they have NPD due to their condition. So the immediate response is, do you actually have NPD or is your OCD making you obsessive about it?",t3_rpr2fz
hq910ee,t1_hq8zty3,I see,t3_rpr2fz
hqa59la,t1_hq8zty3,Exactly; and I feel in all likelihood it's the latter case.,t3_rpr2fz
hqa6sry,t1_hqa59la,Yeah I didn’t see a single thing in this post that screamed NPD to me tbh,t3_rpr2fz
