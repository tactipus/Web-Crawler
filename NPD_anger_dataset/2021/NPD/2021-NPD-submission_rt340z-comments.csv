hqrmn1g,t3_rt340z,"No. Narcs usually aren‚Äôt ‚Äúaware‚Äù when manipulating others. It‚Äôs usually a subconscious thing that‚Äôs effortless. I‚Äôm sure most narcs don‚Äôt even know the meaning of ‚Äúgaslighting‚Äù. Gaslighting behavior came before the term was ever thought of dont forget. It‚Äôs just natural for manipulators.

Narcs who know they‚Äôre narcs though and can understand their behavior a lot more and recognize what they‚Äôre doing.",t3_rt340z
hqqce1f,t3_rt340z,"Yes, I am. But I am questioning myself a few times before I actually do it. 

Example: A friend of mine is acting out his anger while failing to get the grasp the reality. He's gonna lose face and come off as childish if he continues. 

Me: Trying to get him to calm down, for his own sake. 

I ask myself 2 or 3 times: ""Am I the crazy one? Should I do it?""",t3_rt340z
hqqdh38,t3_rt340z,"I have a tendency to make people think they‚Äôre crazy for giggles, but not until very recently did I realize that it‚Äôs potentially gaslighting. Doesn‚Äôt everyone do that though? I feel like pranking each other is just part of everyday human interactions.",t3_rt340z
hqqnqtx,t3_rt340z,"No I dont think I'm aware. For example, before figuring out about npd I probably gaslighted my family at times but I didnt know about it. I just acted like ""myself"" and on my instincts. My memory is honestly bad so I forget a lot of things too like what happened or what I said. I need to make notes of important stuff. Why am I even answering this haha I dont even remember what gaslighting is tbh üòÇ
I need to look it up again..",t3_rt340z
hqs1ufl,t3_rt340z,i dunno,t3_rt340z
hqqcqhg,t1_hqqce1f,You seem to have compassionate empathy and you are questioning if that is crazy. You are not crazy and your intentions seem selfless. That's good.,t3_rt340z
hqs2d8l,t1_hqqdh38,It‚Äôs a crime in the UK under coercive control. You can get jailed for up to five years. Laws in other countries may begin to catch up.. who knows,t3_rt340z
hqqe4kt,t1_hqqdh38,"That do sound fun. But your question on everyone doing it is a bit weird, since you are simply asking if all people on earth have a malicious intent to gaslight. 

> I feel like pranking each other is just part of everyday human interactions.

It's a bit alarming that you do not know the basics of right and wrong. Even psychopaths knows that. Or you do know the difference and is just trying to be edgy or joking.",t3_rt340z
hqqeked,t1_hqqe4kt,"I mean, even people who aren‚Äôt narcissistic or psychopathic love prank videos, right? It just depends on how often or how extreme you go that makes it wrong. I genuinely cannot tell where that line is, so I really can‚Äôt tell what point makes it gaslighting.
EDIT: And no, I‚Äôm not joking or trying to be ‚Äúedgy‚Äù",t3_rt340z
hqqextw,t1_hqqeked,"Ok, I can understand that. Thx for the award btw.",t3_rt340z
