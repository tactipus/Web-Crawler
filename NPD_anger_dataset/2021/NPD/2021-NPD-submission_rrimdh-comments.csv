hqi0ud6,t3_rrimdh,"I looked through some studies to see what the main differences between the two constructs were, but it got long so here’s a summary:

* Borderlines are more impulsive than vulnerable narcissists.
* Borderlines have higher rates of substance abuse, aggression, and antisocial behavior.
* Borderlines have a higher degree of emotional dysregulation.
* The emotional lability of borderlines is due to the strong need for a caretaker and fear of being independent, whereas the emotional lability of vulnerable narcissists is influenced by a sense of entitlement and difficulties managing threats to self-esteem.
* Vulnerable narcissists are more self-conscious and are more prone to shame and embarrassment.
* Vulnerable narcissists are mainly motivated by success, power, a need for admiration and are prone to self-enhancement.
* Borderlines are more prone to seeking stimulation, valuing novelty and change.

(also I couldn’t find quiet BPD in any of the studies so I’m just providing info based on regular BPD)

Covert narcissism and BPD are very similar. Vulnerable narcissism is suggested to relate more to BPD than NPD given the disposition for negative emotions. Some researchers even suggest that vulnerable narcissism and BPD are so highly overlapping that it can be called into question whether or not they even represent distinct constructs [(Miller, Dir, et al., 2010, as cited in Miller, Hoffman et al., 2010a)](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-6494.2010.00711.x).

Despite their similarities, some researchers suggest that the difference between the two constructs lies in cognition as opposed to behavior.

The emotional lability of the covert narcissist is suggested to be influenced by entitlement, and difficulties managing threats to self-esteem. The emotional lability of borderlines is due to the strong need for a caretaker and fear of being independent [(Masterson, 1993, as cited in Dickinson & Pincus, 2003)](https://doi.org/10.1521/pedi.17.3.188.22146).

[Miller and colleagues (2010b)](https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-6494.2010.00660.x), in their article suggesting the construct of a vulnerable dark triad, identified the differences between vulnerable narcissism and BPD based on a study of undergraduates.

They reported that borderlines were highly impulsive, with difficulties resisting cravings and urges, a tendency to lack perseverance, and a failure to think before acting. Vulnerable narcissism, however, was not found to be strongly linked to disinhibited traits (though there may be some tendency for impulsivity when experiencing negative affect).

They explained that BPD is associated with substance use, aggression, and antisocial behavior, and theorized that this would be seen to a lesser degree in vulnerable narcissism, however, there lacks evidence to confirm this due to the limited amount of research on vulnerable narcissism.

Borderlines were found to have a higher degree of emotional dysregulation than vulnerable narcissists, experiencing greater levels of anxiety, depression, and hostility.

Vulnerable narcissists were seen to experience higher degrees of shame and embarrassment than borderlines.

[Huczewska & Rogoza (2020)](https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2019.109636) differentiated vulnerable narcissism and borderline personality based on their motivations and values.

They hypothesized that borderlines are more prone to seeking stimulation (based on their impulsivity and risk-taking behavior) and vulnerable narcissists are more prone to self enhancement (based on their need for the admiration of others).

The results of their survey found that borderlines experienced higher openness to change than vulnerable narcissists and were less self-enhancing. Borderlines were more likely to value novelty and change, whereas vulnerable narcissists were more likely to value success and power.

hqh8l41,t3_rrimdh,"This is a question I'm trying to figure out at the moment myself as I was diagnosed with both NPD and BPD years ago. Recently I feel that I have covert NPD and quiet BPD. They seem to overlap with one another but I'm struggling to understand what the difference is.

I'm trying to study this video at the moment: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEuL7X6oS3I&ab\_channel=BPDBreakup%26CodependencyRecovery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEuL7X6oS3I&ab_channel=BPDBreakup%26CodependencyRecovery)

She's a counselor that seems to know a lot about these disorders.",t3_rrimdh
hqhdzjc,t3_rrimdh,Hmm not sure at first I thought I just had covert npd but I also match the symptoms of quiet bpd too. Maybe you can have both. The lack of identity and emotions changing very often is what made me think I have it along with other things,t3_rrimdh
hqi09a4,t3_rrimdh,As I understand it from dr. Ramini narcs don’t have empathy and borderline have way too much. A lot of the symptoms do overlap.,t3_rrimdh
hqi1h76,t3_rrimdh,Not sure,t3_rrimdh
hqmeyvf,t3_rrimdh,"i’m comorbid bpd and covert npd but tbh idk what type of bpd i have, they definitely play into each other",t3_rrimdh
hqnw3hi,t3_rrimdh,"I find my major difference between vulnerable narcissism and quiet bpd to be the fear of abandonment - I'm not so worried about the abandonment, I'm more worried about my own shame. Shame of course is an emotion linked to fear of rejection, but I feel it's more about me and my image preserving than if others like me. I don't have problems being unlikable if that preserves the image I want to keep and that image is more important than other people, even if they're close. I need others around me to thrive but I want them to keep some clear distance too.",t3_rrimdh
hqvqqsw,t1_hqi0ud6,"Wow thank you for this long reply. It is very interesting. But borderlines also tend to need validation/admiration as well, especially from their ""favorite person"" ? A lot of them definitely do overlap and look similar. When borderlines split, they can also lack empathy a lot as well.


I'm not diagnosed but I think I have either borderline and covert narcissism or borderline and aspd. All I know is that I definitely feel either everything or nothing at all. I either am in love with someone or hate them intensely in relationships. I feel hatred or indifference a lot towards  everyone though in general if I'm not attached to them.. but any type of invalidation can make me immediately hate that person and then I can have a mental breakdown and be impulsive and suicidal. I will also give silent treatment to anyone I hate. I'm also very paranoid and hold grudges. But then sometimes I'll feel nothing at all. Like I'm numb. I lack guilt and remorse a lot of the time. I do have empathy I think but its mainly for animals and not humans. I want to get diagnosed but I hate doctors and have been avoiding them.",t3_rrimdh
hqh9tvq,t1_hqh8l41,"Yes exactly..thank you. I'm glad I'm not the only one who thought this! I keep reading and researching but they are so damn similar. 

I'm not diagnosed as I've been avoiding doctors..but I know I have something seriously wrong with me. As soon as I came across quiet bpd I was shocked because I hit the nail on the head with all of the symptoms...now I read about covert narcissism and I also match that too so I'm confused. Apparently you can have both though but they are so similar that I don't even know why they bothered to seperate them lol.",t3_rrimdh
hqhp7g0,t1_hqhdzjc,"Yes, exactly that. And covert narcs are insecure and so are borderlines as well.",t3_rrimdh
hqiu5cj,t1_hqi09a4,"Yeah, true. Except they say borderline can lack empathy too. It's all very confusing. I have read a lot of articles that say narcs are insecure or they say that are very confident...or narcs do have some empathy unlike sociopath/psychopaths. Like which one is it ??",t3_rrimdh
hql8jsk,t1_hqi09a4,I would say that both can lack or have a lot of empathy depending on their state of mind,t3_rrimdh
hqn7px5,t1_hqmeyvf,Do you lash out or stay quiet ?,t3_rrimdh
hqhcw7l,t1_hqh9tvq,"Yeah I have had the same thought in my head for a while. Why don't they unify the two disorders? Why are they kept separate?   


I'd really recommend visiting a clinical psychologist to get a formal diagnoses rather than self diagnosing yourself even though it might be a correct diagnoses. At least then you can have confirmation. They usually have these sophisticated DSM tests that you take that will figure out what you have.",t3_rrimdh
hqrkdr3,t1_hqiu5cj,I understand that. BPD can lack empathy when they are strictly looking at logic. When splitting happens it mean they are either strictly emotional or strictly logic. In debt they teach you to walk the middle line and use both.,t3_rrimdh
hqrjz3w,t1_hql8jsk,I have BPD and my therapist explained it and how I feel it is that it’s like having emotional sunburn. Other people’s emotions almost hurt me. I’ve never heard of a narc having too much empathy but it is a large world out there,t3_rrimdh
hqn8ndx,t1_hqn7px5,most of the time i lash out like a crazy person then play victim as an excuse if i’m being honest lol,t3_rrimdh
hqhotmt,t1_hqhcw7l,"Yes, exactly.  

I do want to visit one to confirm.  But I have a really hard time trusting therapists anymore because years ago I nearly got committed because I said yes when she asked if I'm suicidal and if I had a suicide plan.",t3_rrimdh
hqnceor,t1_hqn8ndx,"Really ? So you never hold your anger in?? I'm quiet bpd and hold my anger in because I have empathy and don't wanna hurt anyone.

Do you feel your lack of empathy? You ever regret yelling/screaming not nice things at someone?",t3_rrimdh
hqon7ti,t1_hqnceor,"i hold my anger in sometimes if i’m not close enough to the person/i care abt losing them or i’ll be passive aggressive, i have selective empathy i can kinda turn it off when it comes to people who have wronged me but in general i have high cognitive empathy and very very occasionally feel genuine empathy",t3_rrimdh
hqp1e7m,t1_hqon7ti,"Wow..interesting. See I'm not diagnosed but I'm suspecting. I feel everything you described as well. I just hate doctors so I've been avoiding them.

What about animals though? Do you feel genuine empathy for animals? I feel like animals are the only ones I can feel for. Humans I can barely feel anything for.",t3_rrimdh
hr4l2m4,t1_hqp1e7m,"yes i love animals. sometimes my empathy for animals is turned off too if i’m in a really really bad mood but most of the time i care deeply about them and would never ever want them to hurt. i love my parents dogs, they’re like my babies. and if you’re suspecting it won’t hurt to go to a psychiatrist even if it’s just one appointment and bring it up",t3_rrimdh
