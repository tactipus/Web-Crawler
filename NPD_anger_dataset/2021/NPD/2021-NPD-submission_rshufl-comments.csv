hqmp04m,t3_rshufl,"Because deep down we all want to continue living.  You don't want to die.  You only want the pain to go away...  can you explain these suicidal thoughts?  What do these voices tell you?  Do these voices torment you?  Are these voices ""you"" or something else taking place to make you do something you don't really want to do?",t3_rshufl
hqmp1xe,t3_rshufl,"you should speak to someone. suicide is a serious thing. if you can't ""pull the trigger"", that means you CAN be helped.",t3_rshufl
hr25xd4,t3_rshufl,"Suicidal thoughts are part of depression. And if you just recently came self aware of NPD, shame-based depression is expected.

As a chronic depression survivor myself, I would advise you to seek professional help. Pick up CBT. Understand that your thoughts are not you, that you can distance yourself from it. 

Learn to spot negative thoughts, and CHALLENGE THEM. Especially because Depression LIES to you, it tells you that you have no future. But there is a future. 

You will see it once you get past depression. Best of luck. You can do it. And theres is love out there for you.",t3_rshufl
hqmwhr0,t3_rshufl,I believe in the right to die. If you feel that strongly then go to the Netherlands. People with PDs can have PAS. So I hear…,t3_rshufl
hqo468z,t3_rshufl,"If you can’t pull the trigger, you don’t want it. Please reach for some help asap, unless something really bad happens to you. You may need some consultations and meds to prevent it.",t3_rshufl
hqo4x1z,t1_hqmp04m,"Ok I'm goin explain it the best I can. In the past few days I have noticed my thought process change. I am now having the first person voice in my head saying good such as ""I got this"" or ""I know it's goin to be fine"" but there is another one in there that talks to me. It says thing in a different format such as "" you know this is the end right?"" Or ""You might as well not even try anymore"" it speaks my insecurities and fears as well.",t3_rshufl
hqo4dsj,t1_hqmp1xe,I am seeking help my first appointment is Wednesday.,t3_rshufl

hqo65hh,t1_hqo4x1z,"My exnarc used to say “I feel crazy admitting this: but it truly feels like demon possession… an entity taking over me, and then I’m no longer in control.” Usually the 3rd person “voice” has a different tone/pitch/personality.

Something recent triggering these thoughts? Environmental changes?",t3_rshufl
hqo835r,t1_hqo65hh,"Yes, yes, and yes. Me and my now separated wife still live together because financial reasons. But she's seeking other men. Told me I'm a narcissist and get help. There was a moment of awakening when I realized what I put her threw. Kinda a taste of my own medicine. So I started researching and watching videos about it, plus reddit is always helpful. It was like all like I was reading a play book to my mind. And ever since I became self aware the ""demon"" has gotten louder and its almost like I can see it. It has form and shape in my mind.",t3_rshufl
hqo8nh9,t1_hqo835r,How would you describe this demon? What does it tell you?,t3_rshufl
hqo98q4,t1_hqo835r,"In the Bible says that some demons only get out through prayer and fasting. The spiritual warfare is incredible, but real. I’m assuming that if a narc commits suicide, the demon would take his or her soul. It already has control of the mind",t3_rshufl
hqoa3s7,t1_hqo8nh9,"It speaks my fears and insecurities. Tells me to do things like dig threw her phone, end my life, tells me to do violent acts to her new boyfriend. It tells me I will forever be alone if I lose her. And describing it I would have to say it's got a human form but taller and really thin, and a coal black skin no horns no hair no mouth no nose. Head is almost alien shaped but sharper if that makes sense. Where ever it goes or I guess thoughts that it invades. I feel this gunk tar residue left behind. The scary part is even though I have an image and able to isolate the voice when ever there's an emotional situation sometimes it takes over and I don't even realize till after it's done.",t3_rshufl

hqod4ab,t1_hqoa3s7,"Was there a time in your life that you opened the door to “it”?  Clearly it’s not you, but you might’ve left the door open, and it entered and took possession.  It has also taken over, and isolated you to a small room in your own home/body.  Only you have the conscious power to expel it, but that’s only through a higher power.

We have lived a few years here on earth, yet we think we know everything. Spiritual entities and demons have existed for thousands of years and their knowledge and power is vast. I’ve had these spiritual experiences on my own, so I believe you. Some people can only see with their physical eyes, and won’t believe it. Don’t let it win the war. You’re becoming aware",t3_rshufl
