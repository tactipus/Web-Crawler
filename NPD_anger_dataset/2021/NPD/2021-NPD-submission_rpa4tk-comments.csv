hq3jzra,t3_rpa4tk,"I relate. For me I just wanna get it out there so there's no false expectations, and show that I'm self aware and OK with it (kinda). Plus, it'll explain my behavior, yknow?",t3_rpa4tk
hq37p9i,t3_rpa4tk,I feel this hard!! I sometimes have this urge too haha,t3_rpa4tk
hq43vk9,t3_rpa4tk,"Yo, I totally get this. I think that when we carry a secret, it's natural to want to divulge it to someone. It feels like a weight's been lifted off of your shoulders. It also makes you feel less alone with your secret. If you wanna tell, just don't be impulsive about it. Tell someone you absolutely trust: a doctor/therapist/HIPAA-bound person, a **close** friend, or a family member whom you have a good relationship with.

BTW: this is why I'm convinced that one of the best ways to build rapport with someone is exchanging secrets. If you're polite, show warmth, and put some quid pro quo into the conversation, the other person might actually *enjoy* sharing his or her insecurities with you.",t3_rpa4tk
hq4zmmf,t3_rpa4tk,God I feel this so much.,t3_rpa4tk
hq5elpb,t3_rpa4tk,You'd have to weigh your pros and cons carefully. I've revealed publicly through social media and through blogging that I have a personality disorder that includes NPD traits. I can do this comfortably bc my immediate social network is supportive regardless.,t3_rpa4tk
hq8outn,t3_rpa4tk,"its the worst feeling ever, you know who you wish you were well smash it to the ground and see if its fun

but good luck, apparently its what needs to be done

be a mediocre loser and see how it is",t3_rpa4tk
hq6y27d,t3_rpa4tk,"It doesnâ€™t sound like something NPD would do or want, not talking about urges. At least not the vulnerable type. HPD however has some narcissistic traits and oversharing is a big part of it",t3_rpa4tk
