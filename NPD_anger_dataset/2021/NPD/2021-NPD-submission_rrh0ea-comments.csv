hqkb5x2,t3_rrh0ea,"Interesting tactic. What do you do when you have someone who's not very narcissistic and therefore not dependent on your validation then? Because some people have done enough work on their insecurities that they have become quite confident in themselves. So when they approach people, it's not because they need validation or approval but simply because they liked them and wanted to get to know them more. What kind of strategy would you use when dealing with these people?",t3_rrh0ea
hqgmcow,t3_rrh0ea,"Well, isn't that the most rational when you're dealing with people who read into things that don't necessarily mean anything?",t3_rrh0ea
hqkbt7i,t1_hqkb5x2,If they caused issues for me then I wouldn't deal with them.  If I'm not willing to deal with an issue someone causes me then I stop dealing with them or deal with them as little as possible.,t3_rrh0ea
hqkca0z,t1_hqkbt7i,"Right. As in when they caused issues for you and you didn't cause issues for them? Well, good approach. üëç",t3_rrh0ea
hqkeq5r,t1_hqkca0z,"If I don't deliberately go out and cause an issue for someone then I don't see why I should deal with someone who deliberately does so for me.

Regardless I don't owe it to anyone to allow them to cause issues for me or to be abusive towards me.  Period.",t3_rrh0ea
hqkfo90,t1_hqkeq5r,"Right so you get to be abusive towards people because apparently you're not doing anything ""deliberately"" whereas when other people react to you they are being abusive deliberately?",t3_rrh0ea
hqkh4u3,t1_hqkfo90,"I merely do not allow people to be abusive towards me when they accuse me of causing issues for them when I have not caused any.

I once knew a person I met at work who I asked a simple question to and they later accused me of being abusive to them.  That's the kind of person I am talking about.  I refuse to allow that kind of person in my life and I refuse to give that kind of person any kind of validation or help.

I am not talking about someone I have known for years and were there hasn't been consistent abusive behaviour.",t3_rrh0ea
hqkkddz,t1_hqkh4u3,"That's fair. Psychopaths do have a very subtle way of abusing people though. Because they don't trust others' intentions, it's like they're watching you for any inconsistencies and you feel like anything you say can be misinterpreted as a manipulation attempt. And then they don't check anything with you (as they only trust their own perception) and just become punitive instead. So it kinda feels like there is no room for ambivalence, anything can potentially be misinterpreted, they can decide that you're lying to them, manipulating them or trying to abuse them in some way on their own without giving you the chance to clarify anything. I mean I've done this to people for years and I still do to a certain degree because I find it difficult to trust but if I'm being honest, being on the recieving end of it feels really uncomfortable and induces paranoia. Maybe people around you are just picking up on that.",t3_rrh0ea
hqkl7gk,t1_hqkkddz,"It could be.  I always try to leave it open that I could be misinterpreting something personally.

But there does come a point where I do choose to not deal with someone.

Question: Do you identify as a Psychopath?",t3_rrh0ea
hqknzow,t1_hqkl7gk,"Agreed. 

Not so much anymore. I've kinda reached the point where I don't want people to think that I'm evil or callous or have some super human resilience. ASPD is a more humane way to put it. Do you?",t3_rrh0ea
hqkouqa,t1_hqknzow,"Personally yes.  I identify as a Factor 1 Psychopath.  I do think I was born this way but I don't think that makes me evil and I do not think it means I only deserve bad or unimportant things.

Some people at times try and manipulate me into thinking that but I am very practiced at ignoring those people and giving them minimal attention.",t3_rrh0ea
hqkpp17,t1_hqkouqa,Interesting. So you perceive people who point out something bad you did or criticize you in some way as manipulative?,t3_rrh0ea
hqkqcuf,t1_hqkpp17,"I'm not talking about pointing out anything bad that I've done as trying to manipulate me into thinking I don't deserve anything good.

I do take constructive criticism.

I'm talking about constantly telling me I need to destroy myself so someone else can benefit because of whatever BS reason they give.  There's people that will try to manipulate you if they also know you have ASPD into destroying yourself because they have had people try to do the same to them.  Or so they can benefit.  Or because they think that is justice.  

It's not justice, and I am basically just saying I don't allow people to do that to me.",t3_rrh0ea
hqkrz8b,t1_hqkqcuf,"Ah, fair. Well don't know who's constantly telling you you need to destroy yourself or you don't deserve anything good but that's just bullshit. I've had bad treatment from a number of mental health professionals because they thought I was evil and beyond help. I disagree that it's not possible to change though and no point in listening to other people's judgements. My friends know of my diagnosis and they are very accepting of that. I find that for most people, if they have the opportunity to get to know you, they can be accepting of it.",t3_rrh0ea
hqkslfz,t1_hqkrz8b,I agree.  Basically I just ignore those people and do what I need to do.  Simple.,t3_rrh0ea
hqoc1ti,t1_hqkslfz,"So what, you literally just ""ignore"" people? Why can't you just confront them? üòÇ",t3_rrh0ea
hqodrnw,t1_hqkslfz,Do you consider yourself a passive aggressive person? üòÇ,t3_rrh0ea
hqoeb8t,t1_hqkslfz,"Lol, okay then. üòÇ Best of luck! üòò",t3_rrh0ea
