hqapbls,t3_rqk5pa,"not when they are unaware, only when a ‚Äúempath‚Äù has truly been damaged by a ‚Äúnarc‚Äù and they do deep self evaluation will the realize what actually goes on when dealing with situations like that and out of fear they will withdraw and avoid",t3_rqk5pa
hqf3lwj,t3_rqk5pa,Empaths are just unaware narcissists that are virtue signaling.,t3_rqk5pa
hqbmdi2,t1_hqapbls,"I think this sums it up perfectly. 

It takes a bit of trial and error for the ""empath"" or empathetic person, or whatever definition.. to realize that they are condemned for a strange attraction towards the dark as much as the narc will always be attracted to the light for a lifetime. In a way both parties need each other for a reason. Just not the reason they think they need each other for. So it is a never-ending vicious cycle for life, until both parties can learn from each other and figure out what they need to work on themselves to find the right fuck up for each other eventually. Or stuck in the same cycle for eternity.",t3_rqk5pa
hqf3waw,t1_hqf3lwj,"Also probably why you become friends. You validate each other's false selves until someone notices, then it probably all falls apart. Just my assumption, take with a grain of salt. I am a covert narcissist who really thought they were an empath for years.",t3_rqk5pa
hqbpfyy,t1_hqbmdi2,"holy sht bro yup, i love your response. u completely understand it and that was well said. ü§Ø",t3_rqk5pa
hqckdpr,t1_hqbmdi2,I‚Äôve come to some of the same conclusions. There is a balance sought from both ends of the spectrum. Good insighting.,t3_rqk5pa
hqfp0j4,t1_hqf3waw,"That‚Äôs really interesting I also thought I was an empath! It‚Äôs crazy to think that people say narcissists don‚Äôt feel empathy when so many of us convince ourselves we are empaths
Would you say you don‚Äôt feel empathy at all?",t3_rqk5pa
hqfubk2,t1_hqfp0j4,"I think I was traumatized to be hyper vigilant to the states of people around me due to the abuse I experienced. It's an attempt to control my surroundings and survive. My form of ""empathy"" is a trauma response. I can still be empathetic and I do believe I can ""feel"" what others are, but thats pretty narcisstic of me.  ü§£",t3_rqk5pa
