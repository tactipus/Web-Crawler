hqkg4y4,t3_rs2kpm,"I believe that Iâ€™m here on a mission. Iâ€™m not ordinary. 

I shift between being NPD and thinking Iâ€™m actually special and not having npd",t3_rs2kpm
hql4hxv,t3_rs2kpm,"I feel like my god has chosen me above anyone else, if that counts.",t3_rs2kpm
hqjpf69,t3_rs2kpm,"Yes, I've always dreamed about being a demigod with immortality and other powers.",t3_rs2kpm
hqjw3u9,t3_rs2kpm,Yep. Mine goes a little farther. I'm almost sure we are all gods but not in the pshysical plane.,t3_rs2kpm
hql2zd7,t3_rs2kpm,I already feel like I'm a god but there are times where I'm faced with reality and the truth is revealed. But I quickly move past it and go back to the delusion. It's messed up,t3_rs2kpm
hqk7cwp,t3_rs2kpm,I have a god complex so I already believe to be god.,t3_rs2kpm
hqmrwvu,t3_rs2kpm,"Yep, I feel like I am a god inhabiting a shell, (could go all day) but yea I live by this, even if someone tries to destroy this or bring me down. Impossibleâ€¦ I literally canâ€™t falter to anyones words anymore.",t3_rs2kpm
hqk8yad,t3_rs2kpm,"yeah. i have an unhealthy obsession with craving some sort of power. i was pretty powerless throughout my childhood and still am, which made me very prone to mistreatment from others. that most likely has something to do with it, which is pretty unfortunate since i donâ€™t want to be craving power 24/7 but i do anyway.",t3_rs2kpm
hqlkckm,t3_rs2kpm,No. I've dreamed of being emperor of the world. That's the closest I got to wanting to be godlike.,t3_rs2kpm
hqmtnd4,t3_rs2kpm,I've never had this desire lol. I'm curious are most of you overt? Maybe it's not about being covert or overt but I'm interested,t3_rs2kpm
hqn1kxv,t3_rs2kpm,I don't desire it. I am a god.,t3_rs2kpm
hqnfhkz,t3_rs2kpm,"As /u/ensnsowpforke said, more so as potentially divinely destined for something, even if my role is to personify evil for the purpose of a greater good (by exposing my sin, I can lead others to light. Think a demented St. Augustine). However, I do see myself as possibly creating my own religion or something. So, I guess there is a want to be a god, but it gets expressed in a more ""subtle"" way. I used to have angry fantasies about wanting to create an afterlife. Despite that, recently my sense of religiousity has reappeared. I sometimes pray to whatever god is there in hopes I will be normal and eventually love someone.",t3_rs2kpm
hqnpoxe,t3_rs2kpm,Iâ€™ve tried going to church but I still seem to think about god in me a lot,t3_rs2kpm
hqnxmar,t3_rs2kpm,Narcs must create all cults,t3_rs2kpm
hqsd0w5,t3_rs2kpm,I already know Iâ€™m a god in a physical form.,t3_rs2kpm
hqmtdsi,t1_hqkg4y4,I like that view lol. If you think about it we actually are not ordinary cause if we were we wouldn't have a pd ðŸ˜‚,t3_rs2kpm
hqlm531,t1_hql2zd7,That's not grandiosity. That's close to being a delusion of grandeur which is found in schizophrenia.,t3_rs2kpm
hqsd4er,t1_hqmtnd4,I personally am overt malignant and already know Iâ€™m a god. Iâ€™m not sure if it has to do with overt and covert either but thatâ€™s an interesting thought,t3_rs2kpm
hqlrdv0,t1_hqlm531,Nahh I can't have that,t3_rs2kpm
