hqb59eh,t3_rqm166,"I don't have npd but apparently I have diagnosed narcissistic traits strong enough to be disruptive for my life and I'm suffering from them. Am I not allowed to post here in your opinion? 
And no, a few people have narcissistic traits but they're not impairing their life. 

I guess we are again at the ""I'm npd so I'm superior compared to you that you have just narcissistic traits"".",t3_rqm166
hqb9dzf,t3_rqm166,when you confront them their story doesn’t add up,t3_rqm166

hqbc8dg,t3_rqm166,"I do understand where you are coming from. But we need to keep in mind not everyone has access to professional healthcare. And even for the ones that have access, it is a very stigmatized and demonized disorder. Most healthcare providers don’t know shit about npd other than harmful stereotypes. I am not professionally diagnosed yet, but I’m trying to. But for the ones for whatever reason they can’t get prof-dx I don’t mind them identifying themselves as narcissists. And for that 1. You have to be over 18. 2. You have to do your research. Now I can’t tell you who is actually over 18 or not in this subreddit or did their research. But if they can find something useful in these subreddits I’m all for welcoming them. But I agree with you about narcissistic traits. I see people getting obsessed over their moral compass and the second they display any narcissistic trait they beat themselves up for it and think they are totally narcissists. I don’t believe they have npd. However if they are here to understand the disorder or why they act the way they do better, good for them, whether they have npd or not.",t3_rqm166

hqbcrfz,t3_rqm166,"I agree that most people here don't have NPD, but I think it's because part of having NPD entails not being aware of it. It's a dissociative disorder.",t3_rqm166
