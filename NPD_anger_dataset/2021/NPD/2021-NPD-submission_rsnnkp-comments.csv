hqo7oyn,t3_rsnnkp,"Hi there, these are some good questions/ positive aspirations! 

I would suggest one deeper book/video/audio (as you please): The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People; it deals with thoughts/paradigm shifts/ personal victory/ habits changing/ winning with other/ win-win frame of mind etc...

On the practical do this/don't do that, a very good classic is ""The Assertiveness Pocketbook"" - its graphical and really rich in wisdom- [Link](https://www.amazon.com/Assertiveness-Pocketbook-Max-Eggert/dp/1906610363)

I wish you the very best!",t3_rsnnkp
