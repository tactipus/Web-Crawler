hqhkh8s,t3_rrlu42,Depends. Why were you crying? Simply because she was or because you were genuinely upset because she was distressed?,t3_rrlu42
hqh6awl,t3_rrlu42,Either that or you're mirroring. Very common in NPD.,t3_rrlu42
hqhwfr7,t3_rrlu42,What emotion did you feel when right before crying and while crying? That would be key on indicating if it was empathy,t3_rrlu42
hqh6ebk,t1_hqh6awl,If it was mirroring it was very unconscious,t3_rrlu42
hqhx5og,t1_hqhwfr7,"Some different emotions came up. Hearing the desperation in her cry and the intensity, I don’t see my family cry much, when they do it sort of sends me off, I think I tried shutting this down when I was a kid because it made me feel so vulnerable. 
It made me feel sad and helpless for her and then we spoke things over. 
It was a quick and sudden reaction that took me by surprise.",t3_rrlu42
hqh6wsg,t1_hqh6ebk,"For me it was always unconscious until I started paying attention and realized what my coping strategies were for a poor sense of self.

I hope that you are experiencing genuine empathy, of course.",t3_rrlu42
hqhyb4p,t1_hqhx5og,"I think you experienced empathy. Can you only feel it for your family? I don’t have NPD. But empathy feels like when you can almost experience what the other person is feeling- even strangers. I work in hospital, and once I was seeing a patient, and she started telling me about her life and struggles, and I could see the expressions of pain and helplessness in her face. Soon after the encounter I had to go to the bathroom and cry because I was able to feel her. We help patients heal and sometimes it’s a higher, deeper connection to be attuned to another person. However, empathy can be both a strength and a weakness (the latter especially to have fallen for my narc lol).
Now, I haven’t even analyzed this, but we use empathy for everything (I used to think that every human being experienced empathy the same as I do)… until I discovered NPD. So most of our behaviors are influenced by assessing on how other people will feel if we do something (on a daily basis)",t3_rrlu42
