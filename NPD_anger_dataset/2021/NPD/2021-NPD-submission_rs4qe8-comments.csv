hqk9y4w,t3_rs4qe8,"Look I'll answer this being a psychologist, and having read all that you wrote, with the useful background info:

1. You shouldn't try to get a diagnosis online, especially that you read/customize illnesses/traits to your situation freely.
2. From what you wrote, it seems to have nothing to do with being a narc, nor even an abuser, you first suffer from weed side-effects (very strongly), and depression side effects too.
3. Therapy, whole-rounded, is your solution.
4. Its very good you're seeking a resolution, and trying to develop.

All the best!",t3_rs4qe8
hqkylfy,t3_rs4qe8,"You can't really get a diagnose from reddit. You need to go to a medical health professional, such as a psychologist to get diagnose. Even if i gave you an answer it would be invalid, not necessarily because I'm wrong, it's because i don't know everything about narcissism.",t3_rs4qe8
