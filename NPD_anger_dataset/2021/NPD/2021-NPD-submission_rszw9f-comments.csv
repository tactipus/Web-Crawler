hqpn0dq,t3_rszw9f,yes,t3_rszw9f
hqpry6j,t3_rszw9f,"Yes, you share same feeling, it's not necessary to measure intensity of it.

I am wondering why is mainly sadness feeling who ""prove"" empathy. Nothing wrong with that, just a thought about it.",t3_rszw9f
hqqwahy,t3_rszw9f,That sounds like empathy. When my best friend died I didn‚Äôt feel anything but if I see i.e. a dog dying in a movie I feel sad.,t3_rszw9f
hqrltrg,t3_rszw9f,Yes. And TOO much empathy is a bad thing. Imagine having the same amount of sadness the other person is having. It would make it extremely easy to manipulate you. This is why empaths are natural prey by narcs,t3_rszw9f
hqpwn2r,t1_hqpry6j,"There's a trick to it. 

Let's say that Narcissists treat everyone as an extension of their self. 

Question: Are you feeling empathy, or are you feeling as if somebody cut off your arm? 

Examples:

If your fuck-buddy was run over by a car, you're sad because you won't have sex for a while. 

If you made somebody angry, you regret because they won't be your friend anymore.",t3_rszw9f
hqpxdw6,t1_hqpry6j,"It's usually sadness i feel empathy about. If you accomplish something that does not concern me, i won't be happy, If you share a story about you being raped or sexually abused, i will feel aroused and happy. Usually only sadness that gets to me.",t3_rszw9f
hqqxwtu,t1_hqqwahy,"Same lmao. Not a friend, but a teacher died, he had joked with me and told my name was beautiful and stuff. Then he died and I didn't give a shit. But movies have a tendency to make you sad because of the music mixed with the scene.",t3_rszw9f
hqstdqn,t1_hqrltrg,"Yes, luckily I've never been as sad as someone else I'm feeling empathy for. I don't feel empathy in most cases. Only in very rare situations.",t3_rszw9f
hqqj98g,t1_hqpwn2r,"First example is your own sadness, not having sex with your f buddy. It's not empathy.
Second one is regret for loosing a friend. Not empathy.",t3_rszw9f
hqq4exq,t1_hqpwn2r,"I feel empathy. Why would I feel my arm being cut off, even as a metaphor?",t3_rszw9f
hqqjk9y,t1_hqpxdw6,"Yes, I noticed that each time people talking about sadness and I was wondering why only that feeling.
Anyway thank you for your answer,  all the best in 2022!",t3_rszw9f
hqqyb6m,t1_hqqxwtu,"Honestly I wish I cared. Instead I had to perform and pretend like I was sad. 
My other friend called me crying and told me our friend died but all I could think was ‚Äúoh this is awkward how do I make it seem like I‚Äôm devastated?‚Äù
If something bad happens I think ‚Äúoh how sad‚Äù but I can‚Äôt be bothered. Empathy is strange maybe it‚Äôs easier when you get to be selective with it through movies.",t3_rszw9f
hqrc875,t1_hqqj98g,If for example my dog died that i like very much. I would be sad that i would never be able to pet him or  see him. That's empathy right?,t3_rszw9f
hqqkeqz,t1_hqqjk9y,I don't really know. Maybe I can relate to sadness. Although I don't really cry. I have cried maybe 10 times in my life and all those times were self pity. So I'm not really a sad person. Maybe it's correlated with my trauma.,t3_rszw9f
hqqyr4t,t1_hqqyb6m,I honestly have forgotten how to act sad. Like wtf should I say lmfao.,t3_rszw9f
hqrxn5o,t1_hqrc875,"That‚Äôs grief. Empathy is learning your friend‚Äôs dog died, and you understand their grief. Feeling empathy for this hurt for them allows you to appreciate their pain and hold them up emotionally because it‚Äôs a difficult time for them. Empathy could also be expressed for the late dog, letting go of some of the sadness you feel because the dog is no longer suffering. Empathy is present when an owner has to say goodbye with a vet present because there‚Äôs no more treatment options and the dog‚Äôs need to be free from pain is moved above the owner‚Äôs desire to have them for their own comfort. What is good for someone else = empathy. It does feel good or I‚Äôd add there‚Äôs no self gain.",t3_rszw9f
hqsol3m,t1_hqrc875,"Empathy is not your own feeling, it's a feeling of somebody else that you are feeling too. When you see somebody is crying and you start to cry too. You were not sad before that but somebody else is sad and you start to feeling sad too. Empathy means to share feeling with another person.",t3_rszw9f
hqqzdlg,t1_hqqkeqz,"Probably is that the reason, I mean trauma. Sadness is feeling just as others, we supposed to feel it sometimes.",t3_rszw9f
hqqz11v,t1_hqqyr4t,"It‚Äôs weird man. It‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt actually want bad things to happen to people, but at the same.. sorry I‚Äôm just not that affected by this. And if you don‚Äôt display that sadness then you‚Äôre a monster. And part of me believes that other people acting sad are just faking it. 

Especially when celebrities act sad üòÇ",t3_rszw9f
hqst8qq,t1_hqrxn5o,Oh ok. I think i get it now. I wouldn't feel anything if my friends dog passed away. In the same way i won't feel when other people express their emotions.,t3_rszw9f
hqqzvar,t1_hqqz11v,Yeah I agree.,t3_rszw9f
