hqdvrnt,t3_rqjg9h,"Absolutely. Right now, my wife is leaving me because she is realizing that I am narcissistic. The thing is I have only realized myself since she left and started throwing the word around. I did more research, and it was obvious looking back.

I see where she is coming from and feel for her (only slightly) but at the same time it's like what the fuck? I have this problem that is causing me pain (her too but who cares(joking)) and her response is to leave? I even said I would get help and listed tangible ways to fix it. So much for sickness and health. Then you look online and it's like ""how to avoid narcissists"" like we have no dignity and should just be eradicated or something. Because if I could change, I would have. This shit doesn't make anything better. Then here I am just growing more resentful for being abandoned like I'm worthless. But I guess that's how people who must deal with it feel. I don't fucking know because I have no idea how other people feel.",t3_rqjg9h
hqel6ux,t1_hqdvrnt,same fucking way i found my diagnosis. me and my girlfriend of 3 months knew something was “wrong” with me but she fell down the “stay away from a narcissist” google hole and sent me some links and is now fucking my old best friend who just manages to mask his personality a cunt hair better than i can. but i’m in therapy and always trying to better myself. but it taught me a lesson that my ex girl and ex friend never were truely there for me.,t3_rqjg9h
