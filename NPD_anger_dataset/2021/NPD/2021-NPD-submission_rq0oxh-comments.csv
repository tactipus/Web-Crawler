hq8s9iy,t3_rq0oxh,Has it helped produce any progress in identifying/addressing any root causes of your npd?  Or helped ‘reset’ your brain in a way?,t3_rq0oxh
hq9cera,t3_rq0oxh,"Are you doing this AMA just to feel special because you’ve dropped loads of druga? Or do you actually consider it potentially useful?

Now that you’ve broken the veil, are you well-versed with the Archon agenda?",t3_rq0oxh
hq9goa0,t1_hq8s9iy,"Yes, I can say that it’s helped me identify my root problems in many unique ways. I’ve become very aware of even the smallest things that may of stirred up a large and detrimental pathway in my life. And I’ve dealt with this disorder starting with the PTSD when I was 4, so when it comes to unraveling trauma, definitely believe me when I say you’ll identify a lot of issues currently and past.
As far as ‘resetting’ I used to idealize the idea that there was also a way to ‘reset’ but theres not. It still takes determination, effort, and actual true desire to change. It’s a mental game for you, but psychs I can say help you identify the right path for yourself.",t3_rq0oxh
hq9issr,t1_hq9cera,"I actually find it useful. For me I’m self centered and only care about myself, but It’s given me the ability to see the wrong in my actions and actually form some reason to care. 

And for a peculiar thing to add, ego death was also the only way I got rid of my terrible physical health condition for a prolonged year n half. I learned from my last ego death trip that I’ve been lying to myself about all the pain I feel. It started because of me doing it as some form of manipulation and I’ve just been manifesting all these pain and triggers in my body nonstop ever since.

The moment I realized that in my last trip, it all went away instantly, literally dealt with it for a year n half, $6k in medical bills, and over 10 doctors telling me I’m perfectly healthy. 

Yes I can say that when I breakthrough, I am very familiar with the archon mindscape/horizon. The most common dimensional space I see is very very very identical to the Tesseract from the movie Interstellar to give you a visual reference, and after some level of experience it’s possible to adapt and gain control of your journey even after you breakthrough, that control actually lets you dig deeper in that ‘reality’.",t3_rq0oxh
