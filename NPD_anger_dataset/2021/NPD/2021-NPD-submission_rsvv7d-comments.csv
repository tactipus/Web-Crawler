hqosm6p,t3_rsvv7d,".... of course? Like every fucking other person on that planet, also pwNPD can be abused.",t3_rsvv7d
hqp88dc,t3_rsvv7d,"nope, i am immune to any suffering and abuse. Literally, you can not hurt me or trick me",t3_rsvv7d
hqqgsab,t3_rsvv7d,"Yeah my exwBPD abused the hell out of me. Emotionally abused me, knew what to say to really get to me & then what really did me in was her cheating on me + leaving me for someone with that someone even being an old fake friend that i cut off years ago so she was even aware of us not liking each other. I collapsed so hard & havenâ€™t been the same since.",t3_rsvv7d
hqqr5lh,t3_rsvv7d,Yes I think an npd can be abused but I think it would probably be more mutual. For example a person with bpd or aspd can abuse them and two NPDs can abuse each other.  But the npd would also abuse other pds possibly.  I think it's less likely a neurotypical would abuse an npd cause the npd would be more likely to do so. But I think it can happen. Honestly Idk,t3_rsvv7d
hqqy2uz,t3_rsvv7d,Yes thatâ€™s why we develop these sorts of things...abuse,t3_rsvv7d
hqoyvuo,t3_rsvv7d,"Yes, why not? People with NPD aren't abuse machines, so can be victims of abuse too.",t3_rsvv7d
hqoyw91,t3_rsvv7d,"Um yeah? Anyone can be manipulated itâ€™s just that people think with PD itâ€™s some kind of rocket science mission to manipulate the right way

Itâ€™s literally just convincing someone except not using a sob story to get what you want, for instance. 

Iâ€™ve let people walk over me before but thatâ€™s because deep down I donâ€™t have any self respect although the people who walk over me are always under me and look terrible so I know itâ€™s theyâ€™re jealousy making them want to put me down",t3_rsvv7d
hqpzm9d,t3_rsvv7d,"Many people with NPD develop it from childhood trauma, also because of low self esteem people with npd may be more open to emotional or mental abuse in later life relationships",t3_rsvv7d
hqr9iqw,t3_rsvv7d,"Yes, you abuse others, others abuse you, it's normal, it's life, but don't be an arsehole and don't tolerate other arseholes...",t3_rsvv7d
hqr2ke7,t3_rsvv7d,"Yes. I've been sexually assaulted.

I also had a friend who would threaten suicide if I stopped talking to him and I had to put up with it becaues I knew he would hurt himself and I would get blamed for it. He was mentally ill though, I'm not aware of the specifics.",t3_rsvv7d
hqs6zxo,t3_rsvv7d,"Yeah, I've been abused my whole life. Hope this helps.",t3_rsvv7d
hqsco45,t3_rsvv7d,Yes very much. BPD + NPD is a common mutually abusive relationship,t3_rsvv7d
hqye0cl,t3_rsvv7d,"While it is possible, i would think it would be much more unlikely, because one of the most powerful ways, and easy ways to abuse someone is through their emotional vulnerabilities, and their empathy. 
Abusing someone with NPD will likely look different, because they will almost definitely not respond in the same way to the same abuse tactics. 

As an example: 

If i were to start making thinly masked comments about how Sam is incompetent and lazy, and how she doesn't do enough on her end of our relationship, Sam might start feeling bad about herself, and like maybe she does 
 need to work harder. Even if she already makes 70% of our income, and make dinner every night. 
I could go as far as to start implying, I might leave Sam for someone who really understands me, someone who doesn't take advantage of my compassion and patience.
Sam will start panicking to try to make me stay! Sam feels that if she could just do enough, she could fix our relationship and things would be back to the way they were, and i have effectively trained Sam to do 85% of the labor. This benefits me, and gives me control over Sam through guilt, and her desire to be a good partner.

Now if I start telling Dave he's lazy and incompetent and doesn't work hard enough, Dave will adamantly disagree with me, saying he does ALL the work, I'M the one who's lazy, and how *dare* I make these false accusations against him! 
If I threaten to leave this person, he might tell me I'm weak and uncommitted, that I'm incapable of keeping my promises, and that's really why our relationship is falling apart. He may try to guilt me into staying with him, turning it around to me, saying I need to get help. 

If i continue to argue with this person, and not do what he asks of me, he might feel he is being abused, or mistreated, because he feels he is entitled to my labor. Therefore if I deny him of it, Dave may feel that i owe him.

This is can be a double standard, that Dave may or may not be aware of. Only one party may be capable of deep self reflection and change, while Dave simply wants his own needs to be fulfilled, and because he believes himself to be inherently kind, generous, and logical, (or insert other positive adjectives), he may also believe he truly deserves this special treatment.
If i threaten to leave Dave under these circumstances, Dave will either become more aggressive in his tactics to control me, or will see that I am not valuable to him, because i won't be controlled, and therefore ""discard"" me.

*This is also why many abuse survivors come across as themselves very toxic. They are having to internally override their ex abusers messaging that they are stupid etc, with a tsunami of self righteousness that out of context seems childish and absurd.*

This is a fairly common *abuse* pattern. And yes, i use Sam and Dave because abuse statistics heavily lean towards men abusing women, but the gender is irrelevant to the point, except in the case of physical abuse, because women are on average 50% physically weaker than men.

So if you apply this to people with NPD. Which one do you think is more likely to meet the diagnostic criteria? Sam, or Dave?...

Much more likely to occur is a pattern of reactive abuse, where the victim *becomes*, just as abusive as the abuser, to a point where it becomes an all around dysfunctional mindfuck for both parties.
Being abused for an extended period can definitely cause someone to take on the same qualities as their abuser. 
However that's still different, because the victim in this scenario will likely have the ability to come out of that, and feel pain because of it, while the abuser may only see their partners abuse, and go on to repeat the cycle, thinking they are themselves the victim. 

Another possibility would be a situation with not NPD, but something more along the lines of BPD, as this is known to be a very painful disorder to live with, and much of life might feel like abuse for some individuals.

Someone who is only interested in themselves will leave if they are being abused, because they don't stand to gain so much. While as a person who is preoccupied with the woes of others is much more likely to become trapped in this cycle, unable to do what is better for them.

Tl;dr

Ultimately, I think a lot of narcissistic personalities are born out of self preservation or survival, and if that is true, that probably means they have been abused before, and are now armored with a sometimes very hard emotional shell, specifically designed to deflect and avoid abuse, potentially at the cost of everyone around them, and themselves.

I'm not trying to equate NPD to abusiveness. I am hoping to point out factors that influence the occasion that they are coexisting.",t3_rsvv7d
hqsgcsw,t3_rsvv7d,What malignant narcissists? They have both antisocial person disorder and NPD,t3_rsvv7d
hqsrscv,t3_rsvv7d,"Yes of course, narcissists arenâ€™t immortal loool",t3_rsvv7d
hr1lbgk,t3_rsvv7d,Besides my other comments i also would like to directly reply to the post letting you know NPD mostly stems from childhood abuse where it might not even be known the exact cause of it case to case but who weâ€™ve become with the traits behind it were developed as defense mechanisms to fight/avoid further abuse. Ask anybody diagnosed with NPD to detail their life story from as early as possible & i promise you not one has had an easy childhood.,t3_rsvv7d
hqovd60,t1_hqosm6p,"what is a Pw  npd? Can it be a pattern?  Consistently be the one who is abused, manipulated in relationships?",t3_rsvv7d
hqq9k70,t1_hqp88dc,What if the person is a psychopath,t3_rsvv7d
hqs04pw,t1_hqqgsab,I hear BPDs bring NPDs to their kneesâ€¦,t3_rsvv7d
hqsrteu,t1_hqqgsab,I think I caused this for my narc but it was all triggered by him lol,t3_rsvv7d
hqpgqix,t1_hqoyvuo,I know :(. I too am an evil narcissist and I got set up   By a group of scammers who wonâ€™t stop cyber bullying me ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ the girl lied about everything!!! It was an obvious scam and i fell for it!!  Big fat elaborate scam from the beginning!!! Iâ€™m being so abused and manipulated ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ ::cries in npd::,t3_rsvv7d
hqpi7xn,t1_hqoyw91,"While someone under me has never walked over me because itâ€™s physically impossible, I have let someone pee on me from under me once.",t3_rsvv7d
hqyexlh,t1_hqye0cl,Thank you so much for this thoughtful comment.,t3_rsvv7d
hqp2i4b,t1_hqovd60,"It's ""person with NPD"". 

Of course it can. Why shouldn't it?",t3_rsvv7d
hqqg8gn,t1_hqq9k70,they heal from it especially during full moon,t3_rsvv7d
hqsrv3a,t1_hqs04pw,Yupp,t3_rsvv7d
hr1kjd2,t1_hqs04pw,"Lol i canâ€™t even begin to explain my experience itâ€™s like a horror movie but yes, BPDs break NPDS. My ex is diagnosed BPD & NPD with F1/F2 psychopath traits. Once the BPD paints you black they can utterly destroy you especially if youâ€™re vulnerable. ime, the more the BPD knows you the harder they can crush you when the time comes.

My exwBPD ripped my identity out of me, flipped my world upside down & made me the weakest i couldâ€™ve ever imagined. While my whole life i was your typical indestructible narcissist she finally broke me so bad that i self destructively collapsed as hard as possible.",t3_rsvv7d
hr1erg6,t1_hqsrteu,"Yeah i got blamed for triggering it of course but her mentally being an adult child diagnosed with BPD wt NPD traits, she was the problem in the long run. I know i got my problems & iâ€™m not perfect but, shes full blown insane especially with how she did me sheâ€™s shown everybody her true colors so in the long run itâ€™s her loss. Safe to say i dodged a bullet i even feel bad for anybody that proposes to her. If texting an old childhood girlfriend to give condolences for BOTH parents dying within the same year gets you to explode to sabotage your 5 year relationship with your childhood bestfriend while seeking revenge by fucking an enemy of your S/O then youâ€™re more than insane youâ€™re just a complete weirdo. 

I know narcissists donâ€™t have the best reputations but compared to my ex, iâ€™m glad with my problems no matter the challenge it is in my life, i rather have NPD than BPD+NPD cuz i would never do what she is capable of doing to people including the ones that give her love. As someone with NPD i just need a solid loyal partner & in return youâ€™ll get treated as a trophy for life as for someone like her itâ€™s being completely under her control, tip toeing on ice 24/7 with nothing ever being good enough then the slightest wrong move resulting in her seeking extremely painful revenge & trying to ruin your life as hard as possible no matter how good you treated her or whatever history you shared. What she did most would consider it nearly evil, iâ€™ll really never forgive the unforgettable collapse I endured. Nobody ever deserves the pain she caused me.",t3_rsvv7d
hr1jyt3,t1_hqqg8gn,Lmfao yeah NPDs are werewolves we can regenerate our powers.,t3_rsvv7d
hr27hsa,t1_hr1erg6,This is why this is classed a classic toxic relationship filled with back and forth behaviour and explosiveness. It will never work but we find comfort in each other for some reason.,t3_rsvv7d
hr25b67,t1_hr1jyt3,"I mean the internet thinks we're so, so might as well be. Lol",t3_rsvv7d
