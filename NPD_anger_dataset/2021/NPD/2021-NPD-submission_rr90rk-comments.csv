Object Relations is the capacity to see oneself and others in a way that acknowledges both the person’s good and bad qualities.

Infants are supposed to develop this capacity as they grow, but it is believed that traumatic events and/or abusive/neglectful parenting can stunt this development. 

Without “object relations” people with NPD can only see themselves and other people in one of two ways: either they are special, unique, omnipotent, perfect, and entitled (High Status); or they are defective, worthless, garbage (Low Status). Narcissists cannot hold onto their good opinion and good feelings about someone, once they notice the other person has a flaw.

hqfpu0z,t3_rr90rk,"Heinz Kohut's self psychology makes more sense to me than Object Relations.  I don't have NPD but the last psychologist I had said that I was ""narcissistically wounded and fragmented"".  I like the idea of selfobjects more than the object concept, based on an outside person in object relations.  Selfobjects are more like templates we are born with, that then we find or use in our early ""relations"" with people in our environment.  Later, we can (maybe) distinguish them as real people.  Anyway, I could ""feel"" how that might work, how my idealization of my father, for instance, was different from him, and how that had (unfortunately) formed some basis in my sense of my own self.

Other people, clearly, find object relations to make sense to them.  Maybe it's more BPD-ish and Kohut is more for damaged narcissism?

Splitting is/was something else to me.  I had like a Jekyll/Hyde internal thing going on.  The ""bad me"" (narcissistic and selfish) was split off or compartmentalized and I tried to be a ""good girl"" as externally and later idealistically defined.  Approval, for survival reasons, must have seemed more important than my ""self"".  Oxymoronic and illogical, I know, but it's apparently what went on in my (scared) early brain.  So the split in me wasn't so much about the other people as which motivation or action system I was in the processing of using with them.   Were they people whose approval I wanted in my life, and therefore I wanted THEM (no other reason, really, to want people in my life.) ? Or were they people whom I despised, and who I did NOT want in my life?  There were very few of them for a long, long time.  It was mostly ME, myself, my selfish/narcissistic side that I did not want in my life, because it threatened my social approval and, therefore, survival.  Although, with all the anxiety I had with the internal conflict, I got to the point I didn't want to be around many people at all, even if I still felt I needed/wanted their approval.

My form of ""damaged narcissism"" is, I know, different from people with overt NPD.   Kind of the reverse, covert or inverted or codependent if that helps to make more sense.  For people with NPD, maybe the caring-about-others feels dangerous to survival, just as my caring-about-myself did to me?  But I still have, or did have, an NPD-ish ""person"" inside, who cares about me!!  Thankfully I think we are more integrated now, but it has taken virtually my whole life.

Hope this helps somewhat.  I would like to think what I have try to do with myself might be helpful for some other people, and what is common about our struggles.",t3_rr90rk
