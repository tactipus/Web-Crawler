hq29d0x,t3_rp3t46,"The only objection I have to this is that I think understanding the rationale behind the abuse can be healing for the victim, and in that context it makes sense to focus on what drives a person to be abusive, be it narcissism or anything else.

But I also think that the term ""narcissistic abuse"" is thrown around even when not analyzing the aggressor's motives, and for behaviors that are not necessarily narcissistic or abusive. Any behavior remotely jerkish or cluster-B-rish is classified as narcissistic, even though the personality disorders more prone to abuse are BPD and AsPD.",t3_rp3t46

hq6ef42,t3_rp3t46,"Also, it would be impossible for someone to diagnose their abuser as having npd by themselves. They aren’t with the abuser 24/7, and in order to have NPD, the abuser would have to have symptoms that negatively impact their life.

hq6onla,t3_rp3t46,"I'm old (74) and I object to the whole emphasis on ""abuse"" that has been around for several decades but wasn't there when I was growing up.  Yes, people covered things up back then, but ""abuse"" implies a hurt-ER, when the issue for the person is that they were HURT, and how to deal with that.

Narcissistic pain doesn't require that a ""narcissist"" did it, although it can be that.  Human beings can get our feelings hurt, or our sense of self damaged, and then the issue is how to deal with THAT?

I was in and out of therapy for over 50 years.  I don't have NPD but I had like a cut-off part of me that's very NPD-ish.  Therapy didn't help me truly ""find"" it although it probably did help me get somewhat closer.  But then, how to deal with that?  No help.  The last therapist, a Ph.D. with a 2-year postdoc, terminated me after 6 years saying she didn't ""have the emotional resources"" to continue.  THAT triggered something VERY deep and ""hurtful"" and lasting.  About 6 months after that some feeling memories connected with my family of origin made their way into my consciousness, and I realized how very damaging the feeling that ""I don't count"" can be.  And was.  And I so I had numbed it out.

How to integrate that and be whole or have an ego or sense of self that can include hurtful or NPDish feelings is the challenge now for me.  None of the psychologists I have ever seen have any understanding of that, and so I don't trust anybody to ""help"" me with that.

I support the people with NPD who have found therapists to help them.  For years, they said they couldn't be helped, and my last therapist said she had no idea how to help me either.  Despite her very high-quality credentials.

The capacity to hurt other people is a survival impulse.  Let's accept that.  It sucks and there are consequences for sure.  But to get beyond it, both personally and in society, we need to accept reality.",t3_rp3t46
hq2dls4,t1_hq29d0x,"I hear what you're saying, but also sometimes I think too much of the victim's healing becomes dependent on understanding the perpetrator. Personally, I think it should be more victim focused - learning to set boundaries and know when they are crossed, learning to communicate and not put up with manupulation or passive agression, learning to take care of themselves and meet their own needs. I see to many people being dependent on understanding the perpetrator and it seems to keep them dependent, when the goal is to break away.",t3_rp3t46

hq5t47m,t1_hq55kqe,"In your mind what distinguishes Narcissistic abuse from just, abuse? I have a genuine curiosity. 

I once knew a guy who had PPD and he abused the fuck out of his girlfriend. Completely Isolated himself and her, would constantly gaslight her and accuse her of infidelity, scream at her, would guilt trip and threaten suicide etc etc when I found out I was shocked. But I don’t think we need to distinguish a “paranoid abuse”. Do you see what I mean?",t3_rp3t46
hq2glrv,t1_hq2dls4,"I always encourage people to have healthy boundaries regardless of the abuser’s motives. After all, it’s impossible to read minds so you can only speculate about your abuser's motives.

But I’ve seen with my own eyes how much of a difference it makes for the victim to understand the abusers’s psychology. They realize that they can’t take what the abuser says at face value and why, they’re much less likely to be swayed, etc. Information is power. It can even work in the favor of the abuser, because the victim avoids triggering them and stops enabling them. 

That said, I don’t think the rationale given by people who usually use the term “narcissistic abuse” actually represents the inner experience of narcissistic abusers. They paint them as calculating predators, while therapists who actually deal with narcissistic patients often recognize abuse as a defensive/reactive behavior.",t3_rp3t46
hq2jzns,t1_hq2dls4,"For me, understanding the perpetrators helps me understand how to prevent it from happening again to others, which is healing to me. But learning that focusing on myself is important as well is also part of the process.",t3_rp3t46

hq59edg,t1_hq2dls4,"You are not wrong but you don't get to decide how someone heals and personally I can assure you that understanding why is something that I ( and a lot of other people need), I am not talking about this Nabuse circlejerks (sorry but it often turns into exactly that) but about the fact that especially whith things like cPTSD (ICD 11 definition) feelings of guilt and the feeling of being deeply flawed and totally worthless are deep and understanding the underlying mechanisms of not only yourself but also the person who abused you can often is a necessary step for a lot of people.  
With man-made-disasters you often have the problem that it changes deeply how the world and especially other people are perceived and ""just"" learning to set boundaries etc. will often not do the trick of healing. Don't get me wrong setting boundaries is necessary and healthy but especially with pathological and abusive family systems where one person might be subjected to various types of abuse and constantly gets blamed the wounds and the traumatisation is usually so deeply rooted that it not only takes years to even realise that you're not the most vile, worthless and useless thing ever to have existed on the planet but especially when guilt is a control mechanism for you (as in: I am to blame for what happened if I had done something different etc.) understanding the underlying mechanisms is necessary in order to start the healing process and to do inner critic work etc. and to be able to accept that it wasn't your fault; ngl for years I thought I was the abusive one even though I was the one constantly being physically, emotionally and sexually abused, I had to apologise for being dragged through the forests on a dog leash and I did and did feel guilty for even thinking that this was not fair. To me understanding and learning the hows and whys was not only necessary but felt strangely validating because there was no way I could have prevented this as a child and it was not fair, and while I still love and care for my parents I am not investing my energy, my love and my emotions in general in ""saving them"" anymore. I am still not in a place where setting boundaries is easy for me or anytthing or where I don't feel guilty most of the time but the guilt becomes less and less and the or my sadness and pain become more and more visible for me and actually ""feelable"", and this wouldn't be possible for me without researching those dynamics to death",t3_rp3t46

hq9o3my,t1_hq5t47m,"> In your mind what distinguishes Narcissistic abuse from just, abuse? I have a genuine curiosity.

Not the person you're asking but thought I would reply anyway. What distinguishes narcissistic abuse from antisocial/borderline/paranoid/whatever abuse is mostly motivation (ego injury, shame, fear of abandonment, material gain, intimidation and control, faulty reality testing in different areas...). There also tends to be little differences in how the abuse plays out depending on the personality style of the abuser (apologizing after losing control, detachment and cold rage...). 

Knowing the personality style of the abuser and the motivation behind the abuse can help with:
* Better detecting abuse and its red flags in the future.
* Avoiding, anticipating and defusing situations that could lead to abuse.
* Learning about helpful and unhelpful behaviors.
* Recognizing the true needs of the abuser, that vary among personality styles, and deal with them more effectively, instead of just having to work with what they say they want (abuse usually happens in situations of masked dependency/vulnerability and abusers tend to have little self-awareness).
* Recognizing how little self-awareness they have, how faulty their reality testing is, and how unlikely it is that they change.
* Knowing when not to take what the abusive person says at face value, which can help to better hold your ground.
* Making sense of a history of pain. Understanding why you had to suffer, and not taking with you more of a burden than necessary.
* Better understanding of mentally-ill abusive people (when done right, it can lead to compassion for that population and better efforts to help them). 

Ideally most people would just have healthy boundaries without needing to understand. But people often learn better when they understand the rationale behind something. Like it's better to understand a formula rather than just memorize it, right?

Abuser's psychology is particularly confusing because they are unreliable narrators. They are often disconnected from their feelings and unaware of their own motivations, while having faulty reality testing. They often rationalize their actions in ways that make them feel morally right and/or invulnerable while actually being driven by urges they find unacceptable to admit even to themselves. So the goalposts keep moving because the actual cause of the abuse is never actually addressed.

I say this as someone who was abusive and who has read a lot of testimonials from both abusers and victims, and a lot of scientific literature on it, in an attempt to understand why I acted like I did.

Victims are confused because they empathize by putting themselves in their shoes and think what could elicit such rage in the abuser, not understanding that our brains work differently. For example, someone prone to splitting can genuinely love you one day and genuinely despise you the next. Neurotypicals feel in a more consistent way so the only way they can explain the behavior is that they must have done something terrible to elicit such anger, or that the abuser was lying about loving them the whole time. Once they get how splitting works, there's no need to feel guilty about nothing nor unnecessarily demonize the abuser.

That said, most people who uses the term ""narcissistic abuse"" don't know shit about abuser or narcissist's psychology. And probably would not use the term ""narcissistic abuse"" to talk about abuse perpetrated by narcissists. I would say just that. ""Abuse perpetrated by narcissists tends to be motivated by ... and to play out like ..."".",t3_rp3t46
hq2z21b,t1_hq2glrv,"Thanks for sharing this. As someone who’s suffered from emotional abuse, I can say that understanding the perpetrator’s psychology has helped me a ton. Not only has it helped me come to terms with the fact that my perpetrator won’t change (unless he figures out on his own that his behavior is incredibly destructive) but it also allowed me to understand how to set boundaries with him and realize that I won’t get the type of relationship that I want with him.",t3_rp3t46

hq63oz7,t1_hq5xvuv,"Okay, I do want to hear you out. How is it different than other kinds of abuse?

hq9z9v0,t1_hq9o3my,"This is a very well thought out answer. And I see your point. I suppose then my issue comes more with the connotation behind the term “narcissistic abuse”. Since largely the term has become meaningless. I guess I believe that instead of giving our brand of abuse a term to be sensationalized, reframing it to “I was abused, and it was perpetrated by an individual with NPD.” Despite the seemingly arbitrary difference I think that would largely remove most issues I have with it.

hqakob2,t1_hq9z9v0,"I'm glad you found it interesting and sorry for rambling in your reply. Sometimes a comment gets my gears spinning and want to put everything down before I forget. I guess in short my points are:

* Abuse perpetrated by pwNPD tends to have certain characteristics.
* Knowing those characteristics is useful in certain contexts.
* No abuse tactics or types of abuse are inherently narcissistic or exclusive of narcissists. Motivations and behavioral patterns are.
* A lot of acts classified as ""narcissistic abuse"" don't come from narcissists but from people with other disorders.
* Even when the abuse comes from a narcissist, ""narcissistic abuse"" is an unfortunate term, because no other disorder that makes you more likely to be abusive gets branded this way. It also seems to signal that certain types of abuse can only come from narcissists, for narcissistic reasons.",t3_rp3t46
