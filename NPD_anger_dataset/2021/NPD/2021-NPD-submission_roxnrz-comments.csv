hq0zj1q,t3_roxnrz,"yea i completely get you, personaly i try not to get those things to me, im a good person and im not a monster and i have plenty of friends who understand, its a shame the society at large doesnt yet but i hope it gets better",t3_roxnrz
hq1e59f,t3_roxnrz,"you weren’t born a narcissist, it was inflicted upon you by someone (unless your situation is incredibly unique)…. Most people fear what you must have gone through, and they feel like if all narcissists are monsters and evil, it’s easier to cast them out and feel safer. Most people feel that whatever trauma you went though, they wouldn’t be able to and that’s a very scary thought since you’re the living proof it exists and can happen to anyone.

I know it’s isolating and feels incredibly hopeless when you try to get better and are rejected or ridiculed and I wouldn’t want this to stand in your way or make you feel like you might as well not try if everyone treats you this way, so please remember it’s only out of fear. We all hate what we fear, especially something as ominous as most people idea of narcissists is similar to a non sparkly vampire…. They choose their prey, seducing and alluring and then systematically destroy them and killl them and torture their kids… 

Don’t think that people are heartless, there’s just so much shit going on in everyone’s life that the thought of taking on something so monumental and dangerous (and according to lots of people, impossible to cure and treat) and for someone online they can ostracize and feel united and superior to, would seem like putting a child in a cage with a lion.

Also, try to select which groups you visit because if you get shut down too much by morons, you might create more self esteem issues which are completely fabricated by these trolls. I’d suggest maybe privately messaging someone who posts a lot who seems to have good information and intentions as opposed to approaching a group, that way you can check their advice against other things and get multiple answers from people whose words you can trust.",t3_roxnrz
hq1bohu,t3_roxnrz,"people label everyone as a narcissist, bad boyfriend, criminal, business man that scams you. i don’t believe in people being narcissistic. they either are diagnosable or aren’t a narcissist. 

people are often hurt by people they think are a narcissist but usually express their rage online",t3_roxnrz
hq1f4op,t3_roxnrz,"You gotta work on yourself. You’re already doing it by posting here. Try and tell the truth completely for one day. No exaggerations or anything. It’s hard. 

The basis for all narcissistic behavior is dishonesty, mainly to one’s self. You gotta try to be more honest tomorrow than you were today. It goes a very long ways. Good luck.",t3_roxnrz
hq203vm,t3_roxnrz,"You have to understand that people have in fact been horribly abused by people with cluster B personality disorders. It does not mean that you yourself are horribly abusive. It does no one any good to get upset about the comments people make....I think the best thing you can do if you can is talk about yourself, your own story, and help people to see an individual.  Most people will be open to that, the ones that aren't worth shite",t3_roxnrz
hq217by,t3_roxnrz,We can get better and do. Also not all narcissists are bad people or malevolent.,t3_roxnrz
hq2a7wt,t3_roxnrz,"it's because how glorified/utterly demonized most mental conditions have become by media and memes, especially personality disorders. depression has pretty much become a quirky way to get attention (like anxiety), schizophrenia/schizo has become a funny meme/slur to call anyone who disagrees with you in the internet, aspd is a way to be cool an edgy, bpd is used to insult ""unstable egirls""...the list goes ON.

hell even most mental health pages will tell you shit like ""you, just like all other people, are beautiful and worthy of love, dont ever let a disgusting, sub-human monster person with NPD tell you otherwise.""

there are some channels however who try to clear up misconceptions when it comes these topics. one of my favourites is [kanika batra.](http://youtube.com/c/KanikaBatra) 


we absolutely can get better. dont let anyone tell you otherwise. you are a person, not a label. there is a human person behind those 3 letters, whether they are ""BPD"" or ""NPD"", or even both. therapy and some meds can help you manage certain symptoms and help you feel better, though finding a non-judgemental therapist can be hard. 

best of luck to you my friend.",t3_roxnrz
hq2va52,t3_roxnrz,"Well, NPD are viewed this way by persons because many people only know the disorder by the hollywood movies, and it´s create a stigma. For example, in the movies the person who are called a "" monster narcissist"" is a ""bad person"" who do ""bad things""(like emotional abuse).

Not only this but now everyone who act in a bad way are automatically considered a narcissist and its fucking ridiculous. Normally the person who say her ex was a narc is a ""Instagram girl"" who is dumb as a door and are angry because he cheat him.",t3_roxnrz
hq2y6rg,t3_roxnrz,It's because on the one hand they don't have the right information and on the hand undiagnosed and unconscious people with BPD or NPD do cause a loooot of harm especially to their children.,t3_roxnrz
hq157b2,t3_roxnrz,"I'm in the same boat as you. All the videos on NPD on Youtube mostly deal with how horrible NPD's are and cater for people who have been affected by those with NPD. Probably because that's were the money is for psychologists.

I've yet to find a Clinical Psychologist on Youtube that can provide a coherent way for us to treat our disorders other than to give perfunctory advice such as ""be mindful"". Like seriously, fuck off Dr.Ramani. You only care about how the disorder affects you rather than helping the underlying issue.",t3_roxnrz
hq6h1m2,t3_roxnrz,"People don’t understand npd or most personality disorders. Pop psychology, armchair diagnosis, ect play a role in this, and the lack of research. This was a pattern for a lot of mental disorders. Back then, schizophrenia and DID were not as understood as they are now and they were used as horror tropes (ex: Split). Before the huge wave of mental health awareness, people thought of those with anorexia as vain and those with depression as selfish. For a long time, people viewed those with bpd as manipulative and while those with bpd have fought against that, it’s still a common stereotype.",t3_roxnrz
hq8r26z,t3_roxnrz,"Think about how depression is treated/ seen by the older generations today. There's a hell of a lot of stigma relative to younger generations. Over time it became seen as less of an evil thing.

The way will happen with NPD. Unfortunately, its just not in our time that the general stigma against NPD will be removed.

That is just one of the reasons, but a big one.",t3_roxnrz
hqdxxp1,t3_roxnrz,"Speaking to you as a narcissist to another narcissist (just to clarify that I am not trying to manipulate you or anything like that), it is sad that our desire for understanding, and help goes unnoticed because it is passed off as a trait of narcissism and should be avoided. 

So, what are we supposed to do?  I think I'm realizing the best thing to do is cope with other narcissists. For me acknowledging the problem has been liberating and gave me a lot of clarity about my life and relationships.",t3_roxnrz
hqhazed,t3_roxnrz,"It's stigmatized intensely by folks who are neurodivergent---they see behaviours as evil and demonize and dehumanize. I find this funny because that's what they are afraid people with NPD will do to them. You do deserve to heal, and you do deserve to be cared about and not tossed aside. What you're reading and what mental health professionals are telling you plays into the hurt you're feeling and ultimately trying to avoid.

Find a therapist who specializes in trauma and personality disorders, who has experience with people who are reactive and have hurt others. Find someone who has some knowledge of somatics/nervous system  and internal family systems. And find someone who will be kind and also call you on your shit in a way that is helpful.

Regardless if your diagnosis and past behaviours, you deserve to be treated like a damn human being.",t3_roxnrz
hq0zuen,t1_hq0zj1q,I'm afraid if I do get diagnosed to tell anyone,t3_roxnrz
hq1fp1r,t1_hq1e59f,This is exactly what I wish everyone could read. I appreciate your time in typing all that out. Just sucks that narcissism is the scapegoat label for any person who has ever wronged someone even tho it's so much deeper. I am worried about the rejection bit bc in my area psych practices are limited. I could travel but work,t3_roxnrz
hq1f0hk,t1_hq1bohu,I very much agree with this,t3_roxnrz
hq1fxxg,t1_hq1f4op,"I'll try that. Not to sound like a pushover, but judgemental peers in the workplace make it tough",t3_roxnrz
hq2c2ug,t1_hq2a7wt,Thank you so much,t3_roxnrz
hq2vhur,t1_hq2va52,Probably not even real narcs tbh. I hate to say it but some people love playing victim,t3_roxnrz
hq15p5y,t1_hq157b2,"I just got done flipping through FB comments about an NPD victims post and JESUS I had to close it out. Like I said I know some are horrible and don't care (they probable hurt the most inside tbh). 

But some of us want help. I know it's hard through YouTube and books. I'm not sure what access you have to a psych or the financial feasibility but there are some online places like betterhealth and some others I've seen you could try. Don't give up.

I know it's a far off light but I'll be doing my best to share any success and tips I get in the future. Although I know everything is individually based. I do hope you find help. Fuck the stigma",t3_roxnrz
hq10a8p,t1_hq0zuen,"my advice would be to tell the people you feel 100% comfortable telling, or if they need to know for some or other reason. I would probably tell anyone im interested in romanticaly abt my symptoms and try my best to explain because its easier when people get what youre going trough and what are some problems that might happen but for someone like my family i didnt tell anything because they are abusive and call me a narc anyway lol, frankly the stigmatizatin sucks ass but there is a chance you meet people who will understand and support you",t3_roxnrz
hq14zlh,t1_hq0zuen,"I get your anxiety. If you don’t wanna tell anyone, you don’t have to tell anyone.",t3_roxnrz
hq1hjin,t1_hq1fp1r,"Listen, it’s not like being black or brown ;)

I’m obviously teasing, this isn’t the suffering olympics you don’t have to have the most to vent and know you’re valued and understood. But I’m sure if you were told something like satan was coming, you’d be right to be afraid and no one would judge you for anything you did up to random murders or violence. 

Share your understanding of their fear and your story honestly, without extra “effects” and you’ll see people’s compassion. Discuss your various difficulties or examine situations and ask others to weigh in without disclosing your disorder because people think you’re threatening them as soon as they hear that word and they expect you to be a genius manipulator without feelings so they won’t listen after the bomb is dropped. 

Your diagnosis should be shared and respected by those you care about and id really examine your motivations before each post to make sure you’re not getting the answers most useful for you and that you separate your vents from questions as it might create a situation where people are encouraging you to think the wrong thing because you can’t see the situation clearly. 


Also, side note, if discussing people in your life try not to focus on what you think the other person felt, but on history for context and what you were thinking and what caused the explosion if there is one. Most people will take your side if it’s emotionally written and that might not be great :)


Sorry, I just hate that people have to suffer pain especially out of a lack of ideas and don’t want to miss a chance to help out anyone who might read this. Sorry for the word vomit no one requested",t3_roxnrz
hq1hxi8,t1_hq1fp1r,"Last fucking note, I swear.


Get an emotion wheel pdf and print it out or go through each one and learn how they feel and what they are caused by…. It really helps identify what’s triggering or what’s helping.

Even using graphs and making tiny notes helps with seeing patterns that are too hard for us to see plus it helps understand how to dismiss negative emotions",t3_roxnrz
hq1fknw,t1_hq1f0hk,if you hate being a narcissist then you should start doing things for others. show love to who you want and just try be nice,t3_roxnrz
hq1g25u,t1_hq1fxxg,"You don’t have to be honest about being a narcissist, you just gotta be honest in general to combat what comes natural to you which is deceiving people.",t3_roxnrz
hq32o9m,t1_hq2vhur,Exactly,t3_roxnrz
hq16coh,t1_hq15p5y,"I'm really glad to know there are people like me out there in the same boat. What people fail to understand is that Cluster B disorders are like a spectrum and there are people with less severe NPD than others. People like us actually want help whereas there are others out there that are basically sociopaths and we're unfairly being painted with the same brush as those kinds of people.

I'm not sure what to do. I feel that Clinical Psychologists don't really know how to fix the issue. For example I've yet to hear someone give me a good explanation for why ""splitting"" is a defense mechanism. Defending me from what? My ego being hurt? Why am I afraid of my ego being hurt so much? No one is able to give me a solid answer.",t3_roxnrz
hq10hd8,t1_hq10a8p,"See in my mind my family has always been pretty cool. As I read about what causes NPD and other personality disorders, I wonder if I'm missing pieces of my youth or something. It's such a trip. How are you doing with being NPD dx?",t3_roxnrz
hq2cbpb,t1_hq1hjin,I got a little confused in paragraphs 3 and 4. I think I get it tho. You mean to make sure I word things so as to get a true answer and not the answer I want?,t3_roxnrz
hq1fsxq,t1_hq1fknw,"I do try to but then there's that voice ""why are you REALLY doing this""",t3_roxnrz
hq1gadq,t1_hq1g25u,They just expect a tough personality. I work in car sales and even admitting you don't know something gets you poked fun of,t3_roxnrz
hq1751o,t1_hq16coh,"I think (and this part sucks) that there's not a lot known about these disorders in terms of treatment. Kind of like a disease can evolve and have multiple strains but worse because everything from our genetics to every single interaction in our lives (including this one) change that disease just a little. So it makes me think they are just giving us some tools and we've got to build our happiness. This is literally depressing to type because it's going to take a chunk of our life to be able to enjoy the rest of it.

Think of it this way tho: would you rather spend 10 years working on yourself to enjoy to last 40 years, or just have 50 miserable years",t3_roxnrz
hq11b1i,t1_hq10hd8,"Ive always known i didnt have empathy and for some time i didnt believe empathy was a real thing lol i got a bunch of trauma and there is a high chance my bio father has aspd/npd and ive been going to therapy for depression first, then i talked abt it with my therapist and she was like ""yea ur probably a narcisist"" and then i started researching a lot and suddenly all my symptoms and experiences make sense. Im missing a lot from my youth, idk if its because trauma or my memory is shit but yea, overall im doing pretty good, i would say researching symptoms rly helped, i can just tell my friend to give me attention if i need it or apologise for rude behaviour and they will know what caused it etc.",t3_roxnrz
hq2cwkn,t1_hq2cbpb,Yes we often tell stories to get some sort of reaction and often it can be subconscious since you can’t see the blind spot and people will encourage you to react or think about a situation where it’s not appropriate but when we have lots of support it’s harder to tell between feeling right and being right,t3_roxnrz
hq1g160,t1_hq1fsxq,"i don’t think you can remove your narcissistic ways if you are on the level of PD. you can only mask, try embrace it and enjoy your powers but then tone down on the extent you use them to",t3_roxnrz
hq1gd3l,t1_hq1gadq,Ah yea I couldn’t deal with that type of behavior either.,t3_roxnrz
hq11v98,t1_hq11b1i,You're lucky to have a psych who knows whatsup and friends who get it. I hope you learn empathy (apparently it's possible). I often wondered why sometimes when people would tell me sad stories I didn't really care. Not always the case but more than a healthy amount of the time I was just like okay when is it my turn to talk. Fortunately I see that is wrong,t3_roxnrz
hq2dptp,t1_hq2cwkn,That's pretty fair. I've done that before,t3_roxnrz
hq1gcek,t1_hq1g160,Biggest fear,t3_roxnrz
hq1gjwl,t1_hq1gd3l,Yeah it's not awesome but good pay and I don't want to quit in the face of adversity. I'm also tired of blending in tho,t3_roxnrz
hq12lkv,t1_hq11v98,"I dont think learning empathy is possible because its an emotion, but its very possible to have compassion and care abt people, when someone tells me something sad even tho i dont care i recognise that i should probably try to help, especialy if theyre my friend because i care abt my friends a lot, i hope you are well in the future and also have people to support you :D",t3_roxnrz
hq2e6nb,t1_hq2dptp,We all have but support groups are very supportive which is nice but that can be a different account maybe not one for improvement and correction but a fun one to make it easier and not choose,t3_roxnrz
hq1geh1,t1_hq1gcek,"embracing it is your biggest fear, or you asking what mine is",t3_roxnrz
hq12wvx,t1_hq12lkv,Thank you and you as well. We deserve meaningful lives. Remember that,t3_roxnrz
hq1gof9,t1_hq1geh1,Embracing it. I don't see it as a power. More of a weakness. I want to be able to love people for their true self and not what I can get out of it,t3_roxnrz
