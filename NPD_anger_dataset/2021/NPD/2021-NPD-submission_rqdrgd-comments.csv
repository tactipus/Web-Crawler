hq9p9u5,t3_rqdrgd,"you're not a narc. need for reassurance is seen all the time in GAD, ADHD, ASD and CPTSD all of which you mentioned as your current problems (dont know about OCD). a narc's needs arent for ""reassurance"" as much as they are a need for an attention supply, which IMO is a different thing.

i will say, stop worrying about this, but also you've come to a subreddit for people living with NPD and posted an essay about how many panic attacks you're having because you could have possibly had a singular narc trait. do some research into what cluster B disorders actually are, because you seem to have fallen into the popular opinion trap that ""if i have NPD, i am a horrible person!"" when it's not always true. if you want to learn about people with cluster B disorders, find their own accounts of their disorders online. don't listen to a psychiatrist on twitch.com of all places for goodness sake. stuff like that will always be sensationalist and stigmatising.

TLDR: you're not a narc so quit worrying about it. but if you had been, it would not have been a fate worse than death or something lol. 

good luck with your therapy, it might be worth telling them about this experience so that they can talk about your panic surrounding narcissism or even talk about how dismissive your husband was during this.",t3_rqdrgd
hq9rbp5,t3_rqdrgd,"Agree with /u/mizeny that you don't sound narcissistic (and also it isn't a death sentence!). I don't think needing reassurance is a particularly narcissistic trait. The need for external validation to regulate self-esteem is. I guess reassurance can be a form of external validation, although it has the negative connotation of being weak and needing to be coddled. I'd say they're more likely to want admiration, respect and attention. 

Since this is a support sub for people who have NPD and posts by non-narcissists are sometimes deleted, I recommend bringing you questions to r/AskNPD.",t3_rqdrgd
hq9t1pp,t3_rqdrgd,"Well, your husband certainly sounds like a narcissist to me. This is the devalue phase when gaslighting starts. No, you are codependent and you need to go to somewhere like r/Codependency and r/emotionalneglect. At the very worst, what you've got are ""fleas"" (bad habits picked up from abusers, adaptive defenses), but really it just sounds like codependence to me. 

The fact that a simple accusation from someone can send you down this deathspiral is a sign of profound inner critic, a common feature of CPTSD (which is often mistaken for all kinds of shit before it's diagnosed correctly). You might also want to check out r/CPTSD. 

Your husband needs help.",t3_rqdrgd
hqa4p7e,t3_rqdrgd,"Before you even explained your disorders I could tell you had ASD and were definitely not someone with NPD. Also we get people here all the time with OCD who get it in their head they have some cluster B problems, it’s just an obsession. Good luck in therapy though, hope you have a nice day",t3_rqdrgd
hq9pslr,t1_hq9p9u5,"I’m so sorry I didn’t realize how bad it sounds saying I’m having panic attacks over the possibility of having a single narc trait, thank you for informing me and I’ll do more research into cluster b disorders. I don’t think NPD makes someone a bad person but I do feel the anxiety behind my worry might be due to bias from the narcissist abuse I mentioned in my post I endured. Once again I appreciate you calling me out for that as well as your thoughtful response.",t3_rqdrgd
hqcwsl1,t1_hq9p9u5,"I disagree with this comment. You shouldn't be saying for certain that others are not NPD, in the same way people ought not be asking for diagnoses.

I disagree with the comment around the psychiatrist on [twitter.com](https://twitter.com). Dr K is legit.",t3_rqdrgd
