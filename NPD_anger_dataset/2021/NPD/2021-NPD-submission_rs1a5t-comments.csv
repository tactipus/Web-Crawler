hqjiegv,t3_rs1a5t,"very much relatable, yet it's not because you're a narc or anything, it happens to everyone, its because they might be self-centered instead of speaking of something of mutual interest..",t3_rs1a5t
hqjjo1w,t3_rs1a5t,"Yeah, this manipulation technique is called ‚Äúintrude and interrupt.‚Äù My exnarc used to interrupt me or get irritated because I was talking slow, or making pauses, and continue talking. My exnarc even interrupted me to complete my sentences to shut me up‚Ä¶ and then I would be left like: ‚Äúwait, that‚Äôs not what I was saying‚Ä¶ stop guessing what I‚Äôm about to say and try listening‚Äù‚Ä¶ that would further irritate her because she didn‚Äôt want to listen. It was all about her doing the talking. A monologue.

Towards the end, I told her: ‚Äúwe cannot communicate at all. Communication involves two. Let‚Äôs do something: you talk and I listen to you without interruption. Then, I‚Äôll talk and you‚Äôll listen without interruption‚Äù ‚Ä¶ I would do my part, and still when it was my turn she needed to continue interrupting. It was a nightmare trying to communicate‚Ä¶ too much work even without involving all the tactics she applied on me while talking like: blame-shifting, gaslighting, guilt, etc. Now I understand because she needed to assert control. Always.",t3_rs1a5t
hqjlhmt,t3_rs1a5t,"I can listen sometimes, like to hear gossip, information, funny stories etc 

I actually think my closest friends are some type of ASPD, NPD and BPD (you know similar kids play the best), so it INFURIATES me when they respond the same way I do when I don‚Äôt wanna hear them speak

I can‚Äôt stand people not giving me attention to what I say. I have a friend who specifically changes the subject every time I talk about something as if what I just said was complete shit

And now it‚Äôs onüòÇ It‚Äôs a game now, next time they talk about how they lost their job I‚Äôm gonna start talking about how my baking powder just went out",t3_rs1a5t
hqk8ety,t3_rs1a5t,"Me unless I'm with someone I can be comfortable-is with, as in I won't feel judged or out of place or have the possibility of being looked down upon.",t3_rs1a5t
hqksliy,t3_rs1a5t,I hate listening to other people talk about things tbh. it's so hard to pay attention if I don't care about what they're talking ab/it has no relation to me. I feel so guilty about it tho.,t3_rs1a5t
hql2i86,t3_rs1a5t,"Sometimes this happens to me, but usually only if they are talking about shit I don't give a fuck about or consider think they are stupid or wrong.

If they are saying some actual good stuff that is worth listening to I give them my undivided attention, that information could be useful later",t3_rs1a5t
hqo3z66,t3_rs1a5t,"It depends. If it‚Äôs something really insteresting, like gossip type interesting, I listen. But when somebody complains about every day life, work etc. I have to really try to pay attention. Sometimes I just space out and wait until this person finishes. Then, I can start talking and I feel much better. I now can cover this spacing out thing, but when I was younger, I even had a brain scan for it (my grandma was afraid it was some disease). Turned out that when I don‚Äôt care what others say, I don‚Äôt listen, period. I didn‚Äôt think it had anything to do with narcissism, but maybe?",t3_rs1a5t
hqjrvfj,t3_rs1a5t,Be honest. Tell them you don‚Äôt really care.,t3_rs1a5t
hqlpqa0,t3_rs1a5t,Yeah I do this. I interrupt people a lot too cause usually I get excited or just dont wanna wait for them to stop talking. I really need to stop this...,t3_rs1a5t
hqnd8uk,t3_rs1a5t,"I honestly feel like I know what people are going to say halfway through their sentence and I'm bored of waiting for them to get it out because I already have a response. I cut people off a lot with that and I've been told. I'm trying, but people are slow.",t3_rs1a5t
hqjincy,t1_hqjiegv,Yeah i get that. I got many narcissist traits that i should see a therapist for though.,t3_rs1a5t
hqkdust,t1_hqjjo1w,"My ex psychopath bf said I am not a good listener blablabla and then talked 20 minutes about himself or about something (what in his opinion) I  didn't done or said correctly. Basically trained me to be silent using gult/shame whatever came up to his mind.
And he was constantly needed a supply - he gave one compliment about my body and when I opened my mouth to talk about it he would instantly and abrupt  changed subject and started to talk about him, his muscles blablabla talking 15min of longer just about himself.",t3_rs1a5t
hqjkc6i,t1_hqjjo1w,"Damn, that's tuffüò¢",t3_rs1a5t
hqkfoxh,t1_hqjjo1w,"That‚Äôs not a conversation, that‚Äôs a performance. Narcs tend to like an audience.",t3_rs1a5t
hqkwida,t1_hqjjo1w,I didn't know we had the same ex lol,t3_rs1a5t
hqjlsqz,t1_hqjlhmt,"It can just be ADHD or Autism. You kinda have to look at the big picture if you suspect NPD, ASPD or BPD. are they manipulative, do they lie, do they have apathy, And so on.",t3_rs1a5t
hqlqejd,t1_hql2i86,True. I love listening to people who are smart and telling me useful information. It's ironic cause most of the time I talk about the dumbest stuff and stuff no one cares about haha,t3_rs1a5t
hqkog1w,t1_hqjrvfj,"This is basically lacking social skills. Unless you want to be a hermit, it's not going to work",t3_rs1a5t
hqjsn5p,t1_hqjrvfj,It's not usually effective when meeting a new person. Maybe to someone in a relationship.,t3_rs1a5t
hqlq40f,t1_hqjrvfj,"I wanna do this but it's not accepted. Sometimes I really wanna yell ""I don't care"" especially when I'm angry or in a bad mood",t3_rs1a5t
hqjjajj,t1_hqjincy,Glad it resonated; I wish you the best of luck.,t3_rs1a5t
hqkhbym,t1_hqkdust,"I can tell that I don‚Äôt miss giving supply/energy LOL. I‚Äôm more productive now, and can focus on so many projects.

I became so good at getting shit done because I had school, plus full time job, plus doing 70% of the narc‚Äôs job, on top of fixing her drama, AND providing her supply all day long. It was exhausting. I don‚Äôt miss any of this AT ALL",t3_rs1a5t
hqkhi7a,t1_hqkfoxh,"Exactly, the other day I was talking with family, and I realized: ‚Äúwow! I truly missed normal conversations‚Äù lol",t3_rs1a5t
hqkynte,t1_hqkwida,Hahah most likely every single victim of a narc can relate to the above. All narcs go to the same Narc school and graduate with Honors lol,t3_rs1a5t
hqkplrz,t1_hqkog1w,"Being honest is now lacking social skills? I know it's a very very crazy idea to consider, but there are people out there who will actually like you for you.

Anyone who doesn't like you for you isn't someone you should be friends with anyways.",t3_rs1a5t
hqjss8p,t1_hqjsn5p,If it‚Äôs a new person to talk to then it‚Äôs the most effective time to be honest. Already lay out who you are and what you are or aren‚Äôt interested in,t3_rs1a5t
hqltcox,t1_hqlq40f,"DO IT!!! I promise you 100% you will feel so much better afterward. Don't conceal your feelings.

And who's to say it's not accepted? Last time I checked it's what's important to you not anyone else.",t3_rs1a5t
hqki04v,t1_hqkhbym,"Me neither. Drama, exactly! Some partners are emotional vampires who suck all the joy out of a partner.",t3_rs1a5t
hqkr2y6,t1_hqkplrz,"If your truth is ""I can't listen to anything that interests you and not me"", that is not about being an honest person, because yes, it's technically your truth, but mostly is about you having a disruptive social trait. 

You wont get any friends by not being able to listen. The key here is not have the attitude of ""fuck them, they should accept me as I am"" when we are talking about behaviours that show a total disregard for others.",t3_rs1a5t
hqkbimz,t1_hqjss8p,Most of people don't appreciate such a honesty.,t3_rs1a5t
hqkn4gf,t1_hqki04v,"I started to enjoy life again. I can live without walking on eggshells. I can eat slow if I want, and enjoy taking my time to do things without being rushed all the time. I can go out places without feeling isolated watching tv all day long. I can enjoy the little things in life. I can drive my car without the unnecessary stress that I have to drive faster in a rush‚Ä¶ or when she was driving 100 m/h+ to the point of almost killing us‚Ä¶ displaying road rage, and giving everyone on the road the middle finger. The little things‚Ä¶ I can go places without the anxiety, the stress, the drama the narc carries everywhere she/they goes/go. Because it‚Äôs true, for some reason my exnarc took away any joy from life. And life is so awesome to live it unhappy and on eggshells. I also go to sleep, and I feel rested the next day. I was always exhausted when I was married and everyday I used to wake up and think (omg! Why am I always exhausted?). Also, my health improved‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt get headaches, my blood pressure is normal now, and I even compared pictures and I rejuvenated like 10 years in a few months. It‚Äôs incredible. I‚Äôm still thankful for this experience because I learned all the things I don‚Äôt want for my life, I learned about psychopathy, narcissism, manipulation, I‚Äôve learned so much in a few months",t3_rs1a5t
hqkdxlt,t1_hqkbimz,Yeah.. well we don't appreciate feeling like we're forced to like something just to keep you happy.,t3_rs1a5t
hqlhgov,t1_hqkn4gf,"Happy for you to have such a relief! I am glad as well to know reasons and same as you learned a lot. (Driving crazy, my ex did that too!)
Sadly I developed hart problems during relationship with my ex and stalking and smear campaign after I broke up. Nevertheless I feel better now than being on eggshells each day. 
All the best in 2022!",t3_rs1a5t
hqke7y6,t1_hqkdxlt,Me?,t3_rs1a5t
hqm6l44,t1_hqkdxlt,"All of my friends from childhood have many things that that interest them that I don‚Äôt care for. But I listen the best I can out of respect. Now this is not all the time. We are friends because we have many common interests among other reasons. We know each other and have many more conversations about things we have in common. 

Be aware and avoid using terms like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm honest to a fault‚Äù to cover up an empathy lacking moment.",t3_rs1a5t
hqlongv,t1_hqlhgov,"What type of heart problems? I remember I started having strong palpitations and my heart was all the time racing. It‚Äôs been 2 months after discard and I feel that my heart went back to normal. I guess it also depends how many years we are exposed to the abuse

Happy new year too :-)",t3_rs1a5t
hqkebvm,t1_hqke7y6,Oh no haha. I'm just talking about in general. You should always be honest with people. It's what you would expect from others too I would hope,t3_rs1a5t
hqlxscp,t1_hqlongv,"Thank you üòä a month ago I was having chest pain for 30 minutes  (feeling as an infarct), I went last week for heart testing, ecg was ""out of order"", I am  waiting to get an appointment to see a cardiologist. 

It is important how long was abuse but even more -  a nature of abuse.  My ex is not ""only"" narcissist he has a lot op signs of a psychopath as well.
I am glad I am alive actually becase he didn't want to get caught.",t3_rs1a5t
hqkf960,t1_hqkebvm,"Haha yes, I am guilty of that too - saying you while talking in general.

About honesty - I am training to be more honest with a couple of family members in order not to supresse my feelings but it's hard with egocentric people, they are easily hurted.",t3_rs1a5t
hqm08hi,t1_hqlxscp,"Have you received treatment for Complex-PTSD? This type of narcissistic abuse disrupts our emotions at a very deep level and dysregulates our fight-flight responses. With the nervous system dysregulated, we go in panic mode all the time for ""triggers"" or emotional flashbacks.  I still have to close my eyes sometimes when I'm having an emotional flashback and do diaphragmatic breathing to calm the panic responses. Doing cardio exercise every day has reduced the levels of stress/cortisol, and that has also helped me with heart palpitations. I'm doing this course: [Healing After Narcissistic Abuse](https://self-love-narcissistic-abuse-recovery.teachable.com/) and it teaches techniques through guided meditations",t3_rs1a5t
hqkip49,t1_hqkf960,"If you're unable to be yourself around them, then that's their problem not yours. I had to cut off a few family members before because they wouldn't accept me if I didn't fit into their little box.",t3_rs1a5t
hqlg4ax,t1_hqkip49,"I cut off my brother 8 years ago for the same reason and with those 2 I am changing behavior and expectations. Anyway, thank you and all the best in 2022!",t3_rs1a5t
hqlt89f,t1_hqlg4ax,Nice!!! And you too,t3_rs1a5t
hqlxy6r,t1_hqlt89f,Thank you üòä,t3_rs1a5t
