hq3rt49,t3_rp8mm5,Best advice is seek help I have only been a ware 4 days and still don't fully understand. I'm turning in papers to get seen tomorrow morning. It's hard work to use parts of the brain that have never been flexed.,t3_rp8mm5
hq59g71,t3_rp8mm5,"okok sorry i thought you were one of the ones ""npd are evil!"".
i think we just need to change some of our behaviors... we will never be 'normal' but 'more human'",t3_rp8mm5
hq5nroo,t3_rp8mm5,"You sound a lot like my sister - she is isolating, can’t even handle literally any questions.  She is the golden child of our mom.  Curious how you would want family to approach you right now?  She just wants to be left alone.  maybe we can help each other with a brainstorm",t3_rp8mm5
hq3se3m,t1_hq36g6o,Good stuff started happy whole human last night goin to get more into it tonight.,t3_rp8mm5
hq3rz7d,t1_hq3rt49,I cant find anyone in my area that deals with npd :/ if I go to normal psychologist I'm doubtful they'll be able to help...,t3_rp8mm5

hq4500x,t1_hq3rz7d,Any talk therapy will help it's hard man it's a fight,t3_rp8mm5
hq5a0z0,t1_hq59keg,exactly... what is 'normal'?! for some culture normality is comoletely different from our normality,t3_rp8mm5
hq5a1xx,t1_hq59keg,looknfor aborigenal normality,t3_rp8mm5
hq55lf6,t1_hq4500x,I don’t personally believe talk therapy always helps…we will talk ourselves into a victim position any way possible. There needs to be some form of accountability program.,t3_rp8mm5
hq5awi3,t1_hq5a0z0,"Normal as in being able to love, care about others, have empathy, connect with them and not be so manipulative",t3_rp8mm5
hq58f3m,t1_hq55lf6,"It's because we are victims. There wasn't a healthy up bringing that made us damaged. I'm not saying that makes the narcissist actions right I'm just saying slow down, step back, and evaluate. Becomeing self aware is hard and it hurts. It's a long road you literally have to build a new better human.",t3_rp8mm5
hq5ftuo,t1_hq5awi3,but we can work toward this but we will never be LIKE them,t3_rp8mm5
