hqjf8j4,t3_rs0fxl,Idk but he didn‚Äôt commit suicide.,t3_rs0fxl
hqjnb6c,t3_rs0fxl,I think this guy has way more severe problems than a personality disorder.,t3_rs0fxl
hqjzaej,t3_rs0fxl,"Since we are here to really learn what NPd is and not just what the internet says it is, I would say he has to be more than just NPD.  more sociopath, psychopath",t3_rs0fxl
hqkxkui,t3_rs0fxl,"One thing I could say is he likely had a paraphilic disorder (pedophilia). However, it seems like it would require a lack of empathy to act on his attraction to young minors. His behavior of statutory rape and sex trafficking would likely be considered ‚Äúanti social behavior‚Äù from psychologists which would indicate possible ASPD, psychopathy, and/or sociopathy. Having sex with minors is not an indicator of NPD, but it also doesn‚Äôt rule out NPD. I don‚Äôt know much about him outside of him owning a mansion on a private island with lots of minors that he used for sex and sex trafficking, but based on this information, he could exhibit any of the pathologies you mentioned.",t3_rs0fxl
hqm1mo2,t3_rs0fxl,Pedophile,t3_rs0fxl
hqjsbq4,t3_rs0fxl,Totally NPD and Ghislaine is codependent. Narcissists can make you do crazy things to keep them loving you.,t3_rs0fxl
hqkij7w,t3_rs0fxl,"Definitely NPD, and maybe some other things. If you watch the documentary the investigator did mention psychologists profiled him with NPD",t3_rs0fxl
hqjjvl2,t3_rs0fxl,Probably not on the ASPD spectrum,t3_rs0fxl
hqkom7h,t3_rs0fxl,I think he's psycho.,t3_rs0fxl
hqlvtru,t3_rs0fxl,Nah he‚Äôs just an extreme representation of the widespread capitalist delusion,t3_rs0fxl
hqjfpcc,t1_hqjf8j4,Facts,t3_rs0fxl
hqjh3lr,t1_hqjf8j4,I bet he was silenced since many many other powerful people were involved,t3_rs0fxl
hqjzqwm,t1_hqjzaej,"Good point. I thought that NPD has some degree of psychopathy as well, but I‚Äôm still researching",t3_rs0fxl
hqo4yp5,t1_hqkxkui,This is the most accurate response on this thread üëå,t3_rs0fxl
hqlj80w,t1_hqjsbq4,"It surprises me that someone as seemingly intelligent as Ghislaine has gone down the route of pleading ‚Äúnot guilty‚Äù, when she could have so easily (whether it is with merit or not) claimed that she was being coerced and/or abused by Epstein, thus reducing her sentence. Yes, her loyalty to Epstein is obviously very co-dependent. It‚Äôs all very strange.",t3_rs0fxl
hqpsihd,t1_hqo4yp5,"Thank you. I just wanted to add, the pedophilia thing really applies if the girls did not go through puberty yet. (Usually 13 and under.) I don‚Äôt know the ages of his victims, but if at least some of them were under the age limit, then this was definitely a case of pedophilia.",t3_rs0fxl
hqo1szi,t1_hqlj80w,"Some narcissists can act very codependently. I get some kind of bonnie and clyde phenomenon going when there's someone with matching ASPD traits. But if I was in the same position as ghislaine, my narc pride wouldn't allow me to take the abused victim-position for pity points. I have tried that in minor crimes, but as soon as the people accusing me start to believe it I get disgusted and drop the act. It wouldn't be loyalty, just stupid pride that goes against my intelligence. Smartest move I could manage would be keeping silent, like she did.",t3_rs0fxl
hqo4e2p,t1_hqo1szi,I see what you mean. Definitely a lot of narcissists out there who wouldn‚Äôt have a problem playing victim; unfortunate for her that she doesn‚Äôt seem to be on me of them.,t3_rs0fxl
