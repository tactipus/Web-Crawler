hqmxyty,t3_rsdrpm,This is really well-written. I want more.,t3_rsdrpm
hqlqvaf,t3_rsdrpm,"I realize now that I had a lot of fun writing this, and writing is the thing I've wanted to do for a long time but I can only enjoy writing when I'm doing it in a place like here where I know I can be seen doing it. When I open a word document, it's too cold, and nothing happens. It laughs at me. But when I feel like I'm in a bottle of people, outward people, I feel like I can say anything. This is not healthy probably, but I know now and I can use it. HAhaha I love the internet, people simulator.",t3_rsdrpm
hqmvawq,t3_rsdrpm,"You're a great writer. This perspective seems so complex to understand. I wouldn't even know where to start if I don't remember myself, the past, the present and the future.... it's like starting from scratch in a very convoluted scenario",t3_rsdrpm
hqmxagt,t3_rsdrpm,"I read your post again. It's interesting how you define yourself as a ""**vehicle** of hell and hate."" I'm wondering: if you are the ""vehicle"" of hell, who's on the driver's seat controlling you and directing you toward this hellish chaos?

Another thought, if you're just the vehicle, what will happen after the driver uses you, and leaves? It seems metaphoric, but it seems a deep thought in a territory when one is not in full control of oneself...",t3_rsdrpm
hqnljy1,t3_rsdrpm,"Damn, this is so dark and beautiful.",t3_rsdrpm
hqneg7g,t1_hqmxyty,Thank you I love you I will take this as a sign that I should start doing instead of fucking around and when I forget it I will come back and read this,t3_rsdrpm
