hqgog9z,t3_rriz04,"I don't have NPD but I found that psychedelics really amplified what was going on in my head in the background and brought it to the front of my awareness, if that makes sense. Also that was true long before I had any knowledge or tools for how to process those issues, so they could just stay with me. For example when I was 21 I remember genuinely seeing (hallucinating) scowls on the faces of everyone around me, and though I couldn't really make sense of it at the time beyond a friend telling me it wasn't real which helped, looking back that was just genuinely how I felt all the time and it was interacting with my perception more than usual. I carried a powerful sense that people were judging me or going to react negatively to me, and lsd just turned the volume up on it and make it interact with my visual perception.  


  
To me (and I'm literally just some guy) the critical voice that you're talking about sounds like more than just a conscience, and reminds me more of how people describe the ""inner critic"" and toxic shame, which itself is attributed to internalizing shame and criticism from childhood caregivers. What stands out to me in particular is the fact that it feels suffocating, and that it has perfectionistic demands of 100% morality. Those are both very common feelings among people who've had abusive upbringings. That's something that can definitely be healed and improved upon. Perhaps you are in a state of being halfway there, where you're experiencing signs of growth and something pathological at the same time.",t3_rriz04
hqidvv7,t3_rriz04,I haven’t done LSD but plenty of other drugs and the superego voice you described is something I deal with every day myself. I understand 100% of what you’re describing.,t3_rriz04
hqj8cqg,t3_rriz04,"It happened to me once after taking mushrooms that I had a hypercritical voice in my head that went away after a day or two.

I particularly remember this conversation clearly. I was fantasizing about getting an interview while trying to fall asleep, and the voice says ""Man you really like hearing yourself talk, don't you? Why do you think anybody cares about what you have to say?"" and I was like ""Ugh fine, I'll have a sexual fantasy instead"". After a while the voice says ""So playing with your imaginary friends again? Of course, since you don't have any real friends. How pathetic"". Seems like it didn't want me to get any sleep that day, lol.",t3_rriz04
