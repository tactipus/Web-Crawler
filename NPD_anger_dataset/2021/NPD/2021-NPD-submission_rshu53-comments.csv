hqnycfa,t3_rshu53,"Isn't aspergers ""hopeless"" in the same way? I didn't feel too bad, it was more of ""well fuck, I DO all of those things, how I haven't noticed this before""-kind of feeling. Kinda weird, sure, but not really that surprising even though I was thought to have aspergers first, too. I kinda like npd better as a diagnose, I felt like aspergers made people pity and look down onto me in a way ""oh she's bit quirky but we're okay with that, she's retarded after all"". Inner critic words, not mine. Somehow I feel I have more control on npd.",t3_rshu53
hqnyunl,t1_hqms1jv,"Well with the exeption of aspergers (and bipolar for not being pd) those are b-clusters which are very similar and overlapping and borderlines have suffered similar trauma as npds but ended up with somewhat different coping mechanisms.

B-clusters aren't so much of different disorders, they're clusters of trauma behaviour that have been given names for some clarity in the psychiatric field.",t3_rshu53
hqupibt,t1_hqua3us,"As an autist I don’t feel comfortable being associated with NPD. So if he has to say something either tell the truth or shut the fck up; do not go around pretending to be something you are not because then that’s how we get the bad name, because people that is unable to figure out what they are pretend to be something else. Also I don’t think at a personal level it will benefit long term playing the pretend game. If you are all here trying to be better just be honest and learn how to be vulnerable, not to lie more (to others and to yourself).",t3_rshu53
