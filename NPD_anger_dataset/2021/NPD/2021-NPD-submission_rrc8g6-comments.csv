hqffil3,t3_rrc8g6,"Are those facts? Or is this the harsh NPD inner critic talking? Self-compassion is more useful with regards to working on your goals such as losing weight. Trust me, being honest with yourself and your negative attributes, and being overly harsh/self-critical are two entirely different things that will yield completely different results.",t3_rrc8g6
hqgowth,t3_rrc8g6,"This is your NPD talking. This inner dialogue you have right now is also due to disordered thinking. You are not the best but you also are not the worst and thats okay. The fact that you are not as you see yourself when your brain makes you perfect as a defense mechanism doesnt mean the truth is actually hurtful. Somehow you believe that you need to be perfect and best to be loved, to be okay. I know cause I am (was) like this. But believe me you don’t have to be the best to be loved. This false information about needing to be the best to feel okay creates a delusion in which you are perfect. And when you see beyond this delusion somehow you feel like you are the worse because of the fast belief about needing to be perfect to be validated. But tell yoursrlf that who you are is okay. Tell yourself this over and over again for days until it becomes a feeling you dont have to remind yourself anymore. You got this <3 You are not alone i also felt like you described many many times but with constant practice you can get over this.",t3_rrc8g6

hqhoeh4,t3_rrc8g6,"That’s not who you are, that’s what you act like. The reason it feels so bad is because it’s not who you really are not because you’re THAT awful. Don’t treat yourself this way because you’re creating trauma where there should be compassion and relief, and don’t help the disorder grow by treating yourself badly and assume you deserve it because you made a mistake or didn’t realize something.


Think of the situation with someone good involved, and see if you would judge others this harshly for being in pain and lashing out or for feeling unsafe. Most of the time I judge myself for things I’d never judge others for because I feel like I should have done better, all this does is make it easier to accept being mistreated and help me feel less fear because it’s not as scary if I did it to myself.

I don’t mean that you should give yourself a free pass by any means, taking responsibility is amazing and you are correct to examine your actions or thoughts, just make sure you’re adding context to judgement like “would I ever say/do this normally?  What pain prompted this reaction?” Because unless you feel right to act certain ways, judge the action not yourself",t3_rrc8g6
