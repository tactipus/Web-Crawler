hqhzecj,t3_rrp7rb,"narcs want to stand out, and be special, and thus refrain from anything the masses love and do in general, and if they participate, they add their ""touch"" and do it ""their way""!",t3_rrp7rb
hqhz6v2,t3_rrp7rb,Same here I don't know why. I have the same habits of avoiding the popular option on things. Hope someone can bring insight.,t3_rrp7rb
hqiifgs,t3_rrp7rb,"I do the exact same thing, I do it in my head, I do it outright. A couple months ago when Squid Game was really popular I hadn't even seen it and I was just calling it dog shit all the time. My sister really liked the show and would watch it around the house and I'd show up and just sort of try to ruin it for her, belittle it, indirectly belittle her for liking it. There are few things I actually enjoy. Sometimes I'm not sure if I even enjoy the things I do enjoy or if I just enjoy being the only contrarian asshole who can say he enjoys it. Everyone else is out there enjoying things and I'm standing in the back, watching them, turning up my nose and pretending I'm better then them when really I just can't stand that they're just out there being happy and liking something. Maybe it's just me internally trying to convince myself I'm not an asshole but one thought I always come upon when I think of this irrational hatred of popular things is ""the majority of people are stupid so when the majority of them enjoy this one big thing that big thing is probably really stupid.""",t3_rrp7rb
hqjn9dj,t3_rrp7rb,"I hate that you used hades for your example. It’s literally my favorite game haha.

On a serious note I’m the exact same way. I won’t listen to a very popular drake song or watch a new movie/show until after all the hype dies over (or before it even starts). I hate feeling like I’m only liking something because other people like it. 

Sometimes though you might accidentally end up in something you really like during the middle of all the hype. Just smile and ride along. I watched squid game before it was super popular, and I was happy to take part in all the conversation about it",t3_rrp7rb
hqjkp6d,t1_hqhz6v2,"for me personally, I like to be the first to do something or at least one of the first. 

This applies to tv shows as well lmao, I don’t find things interesting when people push it on me, I’m like no it can’t be that good since I haven’t done it or been apart of it",t3_rrp7rb
hqjkstz,t1_hqiifgs,This is why we’re just a cloud of negativity,t3_rrp7rb
hqkvrm6,t1_hqiifgs,"Thank you for this, this really touched on and put words to what I experience.",t3_rrp7rb
hqkw3qz,t1_hqjn9dj,"Yeah, haha, I always wish I could finally be apart of something as the hype happens, which is why I'm really looking forward to the release of BOTW2 and HK; Silksong.

I just wish there was a way to tell my brain that I'm not submitting to the demands of others by allowing myself to enjoy a popular thing.",t3_rrp7rb
