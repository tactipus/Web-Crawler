hq9gro1,t3_rozjk6,"You canâ€™t feel emotions when overwhelmed with anxiety. 

You canâ€™t feel emotions if you keep doing things that are callous and you have to quell your shame by denial.

You canâ€™t feel emotions if youâ€™re detached from some aspect of your psyche instead of facing up to difficult thoughts such as â€˜what if I am abusive?â€™ â€˜What if Iâ€™m not that much more loveable than anybody else? Who will love me then?â€™.",t3_rozjk6

hqbc9my,t1_hqa5ueg,"Well, itâ€™s an enormous task to overcome narcissistic tendencies, and needs experienced therapy. 

Learn self-empathy:
It seems one big problem is no self empathy, meaning no empathy for others. No self empathy comes from maybe some problems with upbringing, even in a seemingly loving family sometimes. Learn to see you as a child and have compassion. Itâ€™s not your fault you got this disorder, but you are responsible for continuing to mistreat people. But try some tenderness to yourself as a child and you may start to see others in a compassionate way too. 

Stop deception:
You have to stop lying to yourself - that is also a big part of narcissism. Donâ€™t lie to others, it will help you stop lying to yourself. Then you can start taking responsibility for your actions. It will feel hard and negative at first, but it gets better as you get used to it and you start to feel other peoples feelings and honour them more. 

Learn other empathy:
Constantly put yourself in the other persons shoes, so to speak, it will teach you to feel empathy to ask â€˜what would I feel like if someone did this back to me?â€™

Start asking what you are feeling:
You will act in certain ways, and have no idea why. You need to identify what feeling is behind the action, even if they are very separate. Eg, acting aggressively to and sabotaging girlfriends eveningâ€¦.why? I felt tense this afternoon. Why? Because someone at work under-rated my performance, and that makes me feel not good enough and weak. 

The more you can identify your underlying feelings, the more you can connect with your real self.",t3_rozjk6
