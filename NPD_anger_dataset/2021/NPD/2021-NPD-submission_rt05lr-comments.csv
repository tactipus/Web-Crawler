hqpu97n,t3_rt05lr,"That’s because most people assume all narcissists are evil. Even people who aren’t NPD have trouble considering how other people feel around them, it’s not black and white. It’s not your fault and the fact that you have sought out therapy shows you do care. The internet is just a harsh place in general so when people speak negatively about narcissists, you don’t need to take it personally.

Also (hope I’m not overstepping), but are you certain that you have NPD?",t3_rt05lr
hqpw2g1,t3_rt05lr,"Dear Sir, 

You look new here. I am not doing this to make you feel better, I'm doing this to state a fact. 

If you find yourself thinking that

* Dr. Ramani is Toxic,
* DSM is toilet paper,
* Videos made by life coaches on Narc Abuse are ridiculous, 
* Literally 60-90% of the Internet on NPD is shit and not trustworthy,
* It's making you go insane,
* You don't know who to listen to anymore,

\--- you're not alone. And you're not that crazy.

Just go to r/NPD and search for ""books"" or ""podcasts"" or ""resources"". Somebody else did the work for you.",t3_rt05lr
hqr59vf,t3_rt05lr,"Yeah. It is a bit shitty when the first things that pop out after searching ""NPD"" or ""narcissism"" are videos with titles such as ""how to remove narcissists from your life"" , ""selfish jerks - narcissists"", ""x signs you are being abused by a narcissist"" etc.. 

Almost feels like the whole world's against u lol",t3_rt05lr
hqpra3r,t3_rt05lr,You know your truth don't pay attention on people who doesn't understand it.,t3_rt05lr
hqqq70q,t3_rt05lr,How do you deal with having both disorders. I'm not sure if I have both but I strongly relate to vulnerable or covert narcissism and quiet bpd. It seems hopeless and I dont know what to do. I'm not in therapy yet. I talked to mental health counselor or pathologist but that's it. How long have you been diagnosed?,t3_rt05lr
hqs01wg,t3_rt05lr,That's really peak. Sorry to hear that.,t3_rt05lr
hqqblrk,t1_hqpu97n,"Thank you for this reminder. I am certain I was diagnosed with NPD and BPD when I was 18. I’m older now and I got all of the therapy and psychiatrists for free through court because of my crazy familial situation I was born into and only taken out of when I was 17. The court appointed people concluded my parents and I all have NPD. Although I think a lot since they were court appointed and free, they might not have been perfect. My therapist that I’ve been with for years also tells me that I definitely have CPTSD from my parents narcissistic abuse which is what makes me act like them. Nowadays I do feel like my general empathy is a lot better but I know I’m not completely normal yet on a general level, yet I do relate more to the BPD diagnoses and less to NPD. I was told for a long, long time my empathy only works on myself but I’ve been able to extend it with lots of hard work. That’s why it offends me that we are seen as monsters, I’ve been able to make amazing strides in therapy and there is hope.",t3_rt05lr
hqqchnu,t1_hqqblrk,"Sorry to hear about your upbringing, I’m happy to hear you’re making progress. You’re making an effort to extend your empathy and that’s admirable. Narcissists are not monsters but people are generally uneducated on this topic and jump to conclusions.",t3_rt05lr
