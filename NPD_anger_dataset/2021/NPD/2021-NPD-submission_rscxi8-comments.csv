hqm739f,t3_rscxi8,"""i enjoy it is when i get ‘supply’ from it.""

How would you describe this feeling when you get supply?  How's the dynamic when you get the supply from a social event?  How do you extract it?  Is it in the form of energy?",t3_rscxi8
hqlwa0i,t3_rscxi8,Can you explain to me in simple terms what mirroring is? I don't really understand it. Is it copying what other people do in social settings or something?,t3_rscxi8
hqlx9gh,t1_hqlwa0i,Yes but not totally. For example there is a show that i dont enjoy that much but i am pretending like i am enjoying it cause my boyfriend loves it and wants me to enjoy it. from my observations averga person doesnt do this to usually.,t3_rscxi8
hqlxxcy,t1_hqlwa0i,"But its not just pretending like your likes are the same, its also shaping your sense of humor, your talking style etc according to who you are talking to.",t3_rscxi8
hqm2tpv,t1_hqlxxcy,"But don't people in general do that kind of thing? You absorb the mannerisms of people who you interact with subconsciously? Like, no one chooses the accent that they have, it's usually inherited from the people you interact with, without you knowing? Am I wrong to think this?",t3_rscxi8
hqnvhw4,t1_hqm2tpv,"You’re right, i would also argue that every symptom of npd is in everyone to some extend, but the dose of it is what matters. A normal mirroring would be just like you mentioned. There is a saying thatgoes ‘you are the average of the 5 people you spend most time with’. But an unhealthy amount is when your identity dissolves, when you are trying to be like the person in front of you just to be compatible. But this is my understanding of it based on my personal experience so you can search for yourself for a better understanding :)",t3_rscxi8
