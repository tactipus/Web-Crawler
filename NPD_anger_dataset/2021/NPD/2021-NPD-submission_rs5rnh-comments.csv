hqkdir7,t3_rs5rnh,"In my 6 year experience with a narcissist, the short answer to the question is “no.” Why? Because it goes against their narcissism and need to assert control. However, the very few times the narcissist came out as a vulnerable infant (which I believe it was her true self), was only at night (in my recollection) when she was drugged with tons of weed + ambien and other drugs. This leads me to believe that psychedelics/MDMA therapy may help bring the true self to work on the issues in a therapeutic setting. In retrospection, it was really bizarre to see her personality changing so much in this state of mind. But it only happened 2 or 3 times in the 6 years we were together.

Update: if it is a brain condition, remember “neuroplasticity” the brain has this ability to change.
If it is spiritual, remember that God has power to free people.
If it is psychological, there must be a therapy.

But I guess this is only possible if the person has the intention or need to change",t3_rs5rnh
hqke1cs,t3_rs5rnh,"Not my friends because they’re too stupid to understand what I mean and I’m not telling them about my NPD


Even though my mom doesn’t understand how I feel because it’s different because of my NPD I still tell her everything. I need to vent, I need to talk shit, I need to let out my anger. She’s a good listener but has problems with thinking she knows everything so we don’t really get anywhere lol",t3_rs5rnh
hqngj8o,t3_rs5rnh,"I actually consider it in a milestone in a relationship when I mention I'm NPD. in fact, it's something I WILL tell someone if I am seriously considering them as a friend or girlfriend. However, often times there's this need to eh- minimize it? Often by pleading for someone to psychologically probe me and disprove narcissistic claims despite all odds. Sometimes I'll additionally mention my sociopathic inclinations. Whether Sociopathy or Narcissism, sometimes there's a malice behind mentioning it - ""so, yeah. I'm basically crazy. don't do anything stupid"".

I see myself as multi intentioned. I wanna be seen for who I am, but I'm also ashamed and feel interrogated and don't wanna be fucked with.

Overall vulnerabilities I'm much more open with. But, only if I deem the person unlikely to fuck manipulate me with the info I told them. However, even when I am vulnerable, I can get peeved when I'm not validated.

""I'm so stupid...."" 
them: ""yeah, you are"" 
""... ugh""

What I'm dishonest is how I feel about people. I don't like revealing how condescending and spiteful I am towards them.",t3_rs5rnh
hqk9q0a,t3_rs5rnh,"I personally have. But that’s because I do have a desire to change. I’m very self aware, I know right from wrong and I don’t WANT to hurt someone close to me. I’ve talked to my gf… well now ex… a lot about my NPD behaviors and concerns I have with them as well as my issues with self esteem that comes from NPD. But talking about stuff like this doesn’t come easy, I can’t do it with just anyone because it requires dropping my act or letting someone see under it. It has to be a rare person that I feel a connection with (which doesn’t happen often at all). People with NPD do have feelings, often times a lot of them. (I personally don’t want to be this way and that’s where the desire to change comes in). But they’re usually misplaced, unmanaged, and fluctuate heavily depending on many different things.",t3_rs5rnh
hqkb9g5,t3_rs5rnh,"Not everything you mentioned are narc-related; and not every single negative can be attributed to being a narc. I suggest you get a proper diagnosis first and foremost.

Coming to your question: it's very normal for a narc to discuss this with those he believes they care about him, in seeking to better himself. They indeed might help.

Best wishes..",t3_rs5rnh
hqmufs4,t3_rs5rnh,I relate to this a lot except for feeling loving towards your parents lol. Yeah I would talk about it with my friends and I've mentioned to my mom I think I have disorder... but I wouldnt go in depth with her about how I feel. Like sometimes I have suicidal ideation (not trying to sound like poor me) I'm just saying the truth and I would never tell her that cause I think it would scare her and make her seriously worry,t3_rs5rnh
hqoikf7,t3_rs5rnh,"tldr; but dude, would they do it? probably not, I wouldn’t beside when Im forced and when my image is better off by admitting it. Imagine being put on a corner with a knife under your neck, yeah i would say it",t3_rs5rnh
hqkwbgr,t1_hqkdir7,"Weed cuts down the adrenaline that boosts trauma related stress and coping mechanisms. I'm very much of a different person when I'm high.

But for OP, sure it's possible. Narcissism is a spectrum, some are more capable of something that others aren't. Also things that seem vulnerable for others aren't necessarily that for the narcissist himself. I speak about many of my ""insecurities"" and problems openly because I'm actually not insecure about those things.",t3_rs5rnh
hqkbb0t,t1_hqk9q0a,"Very well said!

Best wishes..",t3_rs5rnh
