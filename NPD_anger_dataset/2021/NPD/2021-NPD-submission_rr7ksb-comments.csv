hqevggi,t3_rr7ksb,"Good read. Everything sounds about right according to my experience. I particularly like the focus on metacognition. Developing self-awareness and consciously monitoring my emotional states was definitely a game-changer for me, and everything else snowballed from there. I didn't need to learn empathy or anger management or anything. Self-awareness alone made me 70% less antagonistic. Still struggling with perfectionism, avoidance, and finding meaning though.

I hope ""Lucian""'s doing well, lol. Thanks for sharing.",t3_rr7ksb
hqhzap1,t1_hqevggi,how do you tell what emotion youre feeling,t3_rr7ksb
hqj7edj,t1_hqhzap1,"Well, I'm alexythimic so identifying my own emotions is difficult for me. I'm usually only able to tell if I'm feeling good, bad, or numb. That's the start, then you start reverse-engineering from there. Stop several times a day to think about how you're feeling, particularly if you notice a swift in your mood. Ideally, try to write it down and think about:

* If it's a bad emotion, is it anger, sadness, disgust, fear, shame, boredom? Same with positive and neutral emotions. Try to drill down until you can call your emotion exactly what it is, you can use an ""emotion wheel"" (google it) to aid you.
* Think about all the possible motives, given your context, that could have elicited that emotion of you, whether you personally agree with those reasons or not. Don't be afraid of thinking of immoral or embarrassing or absurd motives. Try to think of yourself as a scientist trying to analyze the behavior of an alien species. Don't judge. You don't have to choose one, and you don't have to tell anyone if you choose one. This is just to expand your cognitive flexibility and let your brain do the work in the background. 
* Be specially wary of the emotion of anger. Anger in narcissists is often used to cover for feelings of fear and shame.
* What are the physical symptoms? (brain fog, sweating, knot in your stomach or throat, palpitations...)

At first it takes a lot of effort and time but after a while, you start doing it automatically, kind of like training your brain like a muscle.

It is difficult to do on your own. It's easier if you get a therapist to ask the right questions, point out your contradictions, and help you put a name to your feelings. 

In the pdf /u/ImperiousAnarchist shared there's a good example of how the process should be:

* Patient: I'm wasting my time and potential at this job. (grandiosity, anger).
* Therapist: Last week you said it was good, what changed? (point to contradiction).
* P: I didn't like my boss' attitude (anger, externalized blame)
* T: What didn't you like about his attitude? (ask to elaborate)
* P: He was hurriedly infodumping a lot of stuff to me. 
* T: It's not easy to start at a new place. It can be overwhelming. (validation, guiding to the right emotion)
* P: It was frightful (admission that anger was a cover for fear)
* T: So what sort of thoughts did you have while your boss was explaining you things? (ask to elaborate)
