hqcnuy6,t3_rqsm1t,"I'm a somewhat cured NPD. I had a recession of the false self but underlying schemas are still there although they have lessened to a degree. I made a post about it a few days ago. 

The cure for me was being in a mindset where I wanted to be perfect and being perfect involved going into therapy and exposing myself (not literally). I then had a skilled therapist navigate her way into a relationship with me who showed me maternal love which triggered this massive knot in my gut. That knot indicated to me that I had to end the relationship with my narcisistic mother. Once I did that I felt the knot crack in two which released my empathy which was in a child like state. It also caused the false self to receed back into the unconcious of whence it came. I described the feeling of the false self receeding like a cast for a broken arm falling off my personality being exposed to the air for the first time.

I then had to do a bunch of trauma counselling going back into childhood and adolescence to reveal the reality of the situation to myself. Quite the shock to the unaware narcissist. I then had to learn boundaries and self soothing/compassion techniques to soften the brutal internal dialogue I had going on. At the moment I'm doing schema therapy to recognise behavioural patterns and find a substitute that is more in line with my actual nature. 

All in all, it's a gruelling task, one that I would not recommend for the faint hearted but sometimes if what your Intrested in is personality development and perfectionism as I was it's the only road to go down.",t3_rqsm1t

Psychedelic/MDMA therapy is probably the most efficient and effective treatment for NPD, strong narcissistic traits, and victims of abuse. I cannot stress enough how life-changing 5-10 large doses of psychedelics in a therapeutic setting can and would heal people if they knew it was the best option. It's a tragedy that so many people will never know peace, all parties involved.",t3_rqsm1t

hqctlo2,t3_rqsm1t,"Jesus christ that channel looks so freaking toxic üòÇ

Yeah there are plenty.

I'd advise watching/ consuming content from NPD experts like Frank Yeomans, or things like DBT/ IFS.",t3_rqsm1t
hqcw9kl,t3_rqsm1t,Change?! I love being unique and special üòÜüòÇ jk. I'm in the middle. I dont think it's possible to truly change but i think you can hide the behaviors. I wanna find a way to change as much as I can but also embrace some parts of it. I do have to live with myself and if I dont embrace something's life will be too depressing...,t3_rqsm1t
hqcc4yz,t3_rqsm1t,"its a personality dis order, so if it causes issues to you or others then its where it start to be an issue, you cant change your personality cuz that is you, but you can find meaning and change how you react

imo.",t3_rqsm1t
hqeocs3,t3_rqsm1t,"So there is treatment for NPD and it can improve your life. You can receive therepy from a professional who has experience working with patients with NPD. The problem is that due to the nature of the disorder, it‚Äôs really hard to convince the patient that they have problems they need to work on. However, If you realize you could have NPD and there are behaviors that are problematic, treatment is very likely to work for you. 
   The problem is that HG Tudor is a self proclaimed expert and I wouldn‚Äôt take his advise to embrace who you are. If you actually believe your behaviors are self destructive or harmful to other people, please seek treatment. I think he does offer some insight into the perspective of narcissists, but I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a lot of evidence to prove empaths exist because there‚Äôs no formal definition of such. Also there‚Äôs a lack of evidence suggesting all those subtypes of narcissists exist. I  have never seen him get interviewed by a clinical psychologist or any other mental health expert and that makes me skeptical. (If you know of such a video, please link it to me or tell me the title.) 
   Aside from that, I find HG to be pretty entertaining and his perspective is interesting to me. I think his advise on going no contact has been pretty helpful in the situation I was in. Sometimes people just need to be told that their abusers can‚Äôt be reasoned with in some cases so they know to leave.",t3_rqsm1t
hqi5a8m,t3_rqsm1t,Yes there is a cure but it‚Äôs not seen as attractive by most. I saw a testimonial of a extreme narcissist psychopath who went to jail for multiple crimes and in jail he pretty much had no choice but to participate in a program so he started attending Bible study with a roommate and started to learn about the Lord. Then one day he had a moment with God and asked him to set him free from that monster that he was. Well he had an encounter with God and became born again. His life changed forever. He had empathy and love something he knew nothing about towards others. He even married and had children and was set free from that demon inside of his mind. That‚Äôs the only story where a legit criminal psychopath changed by the power of God. So yes it‚Äôs possible but not by human means.,t3_rqsm1t
hqcn62u,t3_rqsm1t,"It's not something to be cured, it's a condition. I don't think it can be ""cured"" outside of complex brain augmentations we don't yet have access to. It can be managed. If embracing it means accepting your reality and finding a way to make it work with external reality, yes. It should be embraced. Narcissists are the monsters and people mostly want to cure them or domesticate them out of fear. Not for altruistic reasons. People would also fear an extremely advanced and just AI to judge them but they would love that AI as a powerful servant.

Really though, everyone loves narcissists. Narcissists can manage being narcissists (you can't really miss having empathy if you never had it) and they can be inhumanly efficient. All society requires is acceptable behaviors which can be achieved through proper environment, discipline and perhaps some drugs for our Narc.PS: I only know of Paarthurnax who managed to enlighten beyond his nature.",t3_rqsm1t
hqf3qjp,t3_rqsm1t,"Stop watching HG Tudor. His channel is a joke and he‚Äôs nothing but a grifter. For real narcissists this disorder makes like hellish, but we aren‚Äôt some demons sucking life outta everything we see",t3_rqsm1t
hqdrc96,t1_hqcnuy6,"Omg since one of the causes of NPD is a temperament in a child where he cannot self soothe, those techniques to learn self soothing sound wonderful. I need that.",t3_rqsm1t
hqcukae,t1_hqcnuy6,">cured NPD. I had a recession of the false self

How intriguing your experience. I'm wondering what type of therapy you had before doing ""schema therapy""?  Was that therapist specialized in NPD?",t3_rqsm1t
hqeueaj,t1_hqd9gd3,"Yes, and how many places in the world actually offer this? They‚Äôre almost non-existent‚Ä¶",t3_rqsm1t
hqfwac5,t1_hqd9gd3,">Psychedelic/MDMA therapy

Very interesting! Thanks for this info. First time I read about this type of therapy. How can we find a therapist that works with Psychedelic/MDMA therapy?  I can't see many option in my state. Could the patient become addicted to these drugs? (even when administered in small doses)?",t3_rqsm1t
hqdrhsn,t1_hqcc4yz,"I don‚Äôt like the ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt change your personality‚Äù line. Number one, it‚Äôs inaccurate. NPD is not necessary our personality. Personality is complex, and we, like borderline people, need techniques to reduce and tend to the extremes in our personality.",t3_rqsm1t
hqi6zox,t1_hqi5a8m,"So, could this personality disorder be truly caused sometimes by demons? I thought I was crazy, but I sensed her demons when she had episodes of narcissistic rage. It was literally something like this: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cy58t8eMFNw&t=11s

The iris of her eyes turned smaller and I could sense the change of energy. Her skin turned pale/grayish, and she would start producing thick saliva in her mouth. I felt panic. She then would start screaming and throwing things around, hit me with strength, fall on the floor and hit herself. Then, start sobbing with lack of breathing, and pass out in the bed. After cooling off (usually with medication)‚Ä¶ she would say that she felt bad about saying it, but ‚Äúthese episodes felt like demon possession‚Ä¶ as if a demon took over and she was not able to control herself.‚Äù I told her psychiatrist about this and she said that it was narcissistic rage. I don‚Äôt know how to explain this to other people, but I honestly feel like it was demon possession.

Btw, if you know the link to the testimonial, please share it. It‚Äôd be interesting to watch it",t3_rqsm1t

hqctkxu,t1_hqcn62u,"I can see your point. So, not having empathy has its benefits. But what are the disadvantages of not having empathy?

Interesting, so there's no winning here. Narcs are what they are and will continue following their nature. How would you describe what a Narc obtains from a good 'prey'?

The point of being efficient AI totally makes me see it in different context",t3_rqsm1t
hqcz2zu,t1_hqcn62u,"Alot of people think this way that the brain is fixed and that's due to the hyperfixation modern science  has on the material plane and this is fine and what science is good at. However, I think the relationship between matter and conciousness is 50/50 and that the placebo effect is a HUGE indicator of this which is something scientists have no clue about. In summary, you interact with the brain and it changes conciousness, you interact with conciousness and it changes the brain. Alot more can be done with psychology then most people imagine.",t3_rqsm1t
hqcwoy2,t1_hqcukae,"Nope, I think she was being advised but as I'm pretty sure it's quite complex and mistake prone. I'm pretty sure it was similar to what Sam vaknin describes as cold therapy in a non holding environment. The attachment disorder was treated first, then the replicated maternal love then it kinda just unravelled from there.",t3_rqsm1t

hqdswj8,t1_hqdrhsn,"well you just said it, reduce not cure lol",t3_rqsm1t
hqirof9,t1_hqi6zox,Yes it sounds demonic in nature. Look up more YouTube videos on deliverance from demons. There are some real scary testimonies where people manifest just as you describe when the power of God is in front of them through prayer and are set free. There is no way that is psychological in nature. There are dark forces amongst us causing chaos. I‚Äôll find the one about the psychopath and link it on here for everyone to see. It was pretty interesting how he was set free.,t3_rqsm1t

hqlcowp,t1_hql5jfx,Yeah it probably looks like that I won't lie. I remember screaming like that in a rage too :( The thing is I havent raged in a really really long time.

hqdd6xt,t1_hqd3115,"Intuition goes before understanding but we still don't need to split the planes into matter and magic. 

There are blind people who can ""see"" with their ears through training and technology. It's still not eye sight and it's not a cure for blindness but it's something.

N brain is different physically and process-wise. Narcs can cultivate strong pseudo empathy which isn't the same as normal empathy. 

At any rate adaptation and management are the only real options.",t3_rqsm1t

hqdg6pr,t1_hqdd6xt,"It's not magic, it's conciousness. It's the way trauma can be seen on mri scans in cases like PTSD. The experience of the environment goes through a filter ie. Your conciousness,  which can result in physical changes to the brain. My experience is inline with this ie. I wasn't born a narc - I was primed to be one through childhood but it wasn't until a major trauma that I was encapsulated by the full NPD narcissistic mechanism (false self)  which would have shown changes to my brain. It was by interacting with that conciousness on a therapists behalf that the false self (which would have had a biological imprint) receded which again would likely show changes to my brain. I was referencing the placebo effect to highlight that there is a relationship between the concious overlay and the physical elements of the body.",t3_rqsm1t
