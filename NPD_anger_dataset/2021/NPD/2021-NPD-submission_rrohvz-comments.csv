hqigv5v,t3_rrohvz,"1) narcissists are not awful by default

2) through therapy, probably

3) NPD is resilient, i’ve read that from a counselor’s book. it’s also not very well researched. i don’t think there are any statistics to show how many are able to show no narcissistic symptoms after therapy",t3_rrohvz
hqi03mu,t3_rrohvz,Best advice I can give is get better copeing mechanism. Realize the trouble behavior and take corrective action. I was in your position a week ago. It's hard work but that's only if you really want to change. If you need some one to talk to message me any time I'm here for you. Also I forgot to say it but your not a bad person. Just got some damage and don't know how to cope that's all,t3_rrohvz
hqiotb8,t3_rrohvz,"Let me guess, you’re around 15? I see this a lot lately, teenagers trying to identify with mental disorders. No judgment, though, I know you have a lot to figure out. And it’s actually great that you think about the consequences of your behavior.
Look, we all have narcissistic traits, it’s normal. Talk to a therapist about it.",t3_rrohvz
hqjhjjk,t3_rrohvz,"Just saw that you're 14, narcissism is healthy for an individual during existential come up. You're starting to separate and individuate from mom and dad. But now it's like ""who are you"", well simply put almost nobody: there's some childhood introjects, but no abundance adult experiences yet to complete personality formation. You're just potential, and hopefully grandiose enough to own and stand up to the world with that potential and fly away.....""fake it till you make it"" as some would say.



The adult narcissist-what you're afraid of being-lacks the emotional agency to experience their own lives and selves, and therefore must do so vicariously (other's admiration and love) just feel like they exist. The narcissist fakes it and never stops faking it after they do make it. Their experiences are disembodied and consequently their personality as well.....just left in a menagerie for others to judge.",t3_rrohvz
hqhysl2,t3_rrohvz,"nope, good luck.",t3_rrohvz
hqi6dhl,t3_rrohvz,"If you think you’re a narcissist but aren’t really sure, chances are you’re not. You may be slightly more narcissistic than the average person but I doubt you’re you would qualify for a diagnosis. You’re most likely fine.",t3_rrohvz
hqiaz2f,t3_rrohvz,"why do you think u might be? also if you're self aware, there's room for improvement.",t3_rrohvz
hqja30x,t3_rrohvz, Most likely not a narcissist a narcissist cannot admit to this. They think they are perfect and everyone else is the problem. You also must be properly diagnosed first and I have read younger people can have a lot of narcissistic traits but it’s how you handle it so it doesn’t progress over time... I think you’re fine!,t3_rrohvz
hqjbb1c,t3_rrohvz,You can't have a personality disorder when you're underage because your personality is not developed yet.,t3_rrohvz
hql18wo,t3_rrohvz,"I'm too fucking drunk to read all the anwers, but a few already said it (I think). 

Narcissism is something a lot of teenagers experience, so I wouldn't actually be too harsh to yourself. Just wait how it turns out for you, maybe you unlearn your behaviours until you're an adult, maybe you won't and be one of us, lol.

Either way, if you learn how to manage your symptoms it's absolutely nothing to be ashamed of. Damn, I don't manage my symptoms at all and even I am not ashamed of it.",t3_rrohvz
hqig3p1,t3_rrohvz,You probably are one for sure… I can just see it in your post,t3_rrohvz
hqirz46,t1_hqiotb8,"You're really close. I'm 14. I don't have money for a therapist tho.

I don't like it when people pretend that they have a mental disorder or seeing abuse as ""quirky"", especially on TikTok haha.I genuinely question myself wether I'm narcissistic because my parents are narcissistic themselves. What's even worse is that they think they're doing nothing wrong to their child. I used to seek validation from my parents a lot but stopped when I realized that they find their emotionally neglected child annoying and an attention seeker, when all I ask for was for them to treat me atleast as a person because I know that they didn't even want me as their child in the first place. They praise me when I do good academically because it makes them look like good parents, when in reality they couldn't even lend an minute of their time to help me with my school work like, something that normal parents do.

Im sorry for the long rant but It's just tiring when people downplay my feelings. It's very difficult living self absorbed narcs with inflated egos, you should know since you probably went through the same trauma that a lot of people do. I just don't want to develop the same behavior like them but it's probably inevitable since I never had a parent figure and will likely follow their footsteps.",t3_rrohvz
hql0uum,t1_hqiotb8,Good answer.,t3_rrohvz
hqk7lw7,t1_hqjhjjk,"Also, very very important: do not identify with this grandiousity. Be humbled by your defeats, it is a taste of   a better you ahead. The unhealthy narcissist internalizes defeat as a threat to their sense of self.


Don't worry about ""being"", yet. Just *exist* freely and openly, and ""being"" will come to you.",t3_rrohvz
hqiddov,t1_hqiaz2f,Because my parents are.,t3_rrohvz
hqiu0ks,t1_hqirz46,"I feel you, I had a similar experience with my parents: they made me feel invalidated. And I too once promised to myself I would never be like them, and it worked. You seem to be self-conscious, and that means you’re on the right path. 

As for the therapist, I found mine in my college. She’s amazing, and our sessions are free. You should inquire about psychological services at your school.",t3_rrohvz
hqigden,t1_hqiddov,Your not a narc because your didn’t write a magnum opus on your narc traits and history of your narc reality. As if we cared. Narcs are long winded as fuck,t3_rrohvz
hqiu4is,t1_hqiu0ks,Im at a public school in a third world country but I'll see what I can find.,t3_rrohvz
