hq89983,t1_hq82a89,"Quantum Healing Hypnosis Technique - it was discovered by Dolores Canon, a psychologist who practiced hypnosis. She experimented and dived a little deeper into the subconscious, and found what she later called the Superconcious. It also deals with past lives and more metaphysical territory. The technique is meant to explore the true/deeper self, and heal through past life regressions. It‚Äôs been known to heal patients psychologically and physically as well. I haven‚Äôt tried it yet, but I‚Äôve already spoken to someone who practices it near me, and I‚Äôm definitely  going for it. 

I had a friend with diagnosed NPD. We talked for a bit about ego death, and how it works for recovery when it comes to narcissism. He walked me through a bunch of stuff that reminded me of QHHT, since it‚Äôs another way of stripping down the masks and armors of all kind in order to heal.

P.S.
Thanks xD",t3_rpwugy
