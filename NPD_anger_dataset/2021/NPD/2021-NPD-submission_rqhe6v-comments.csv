hqaeeg6,t3_rqhe6v,"You have so many thoughts and you feel so many emotions after becoming self-aware... 
Maybe you should try writing down your thoughts or trying not to supress what you feel, and feel it (if you are supressing them). You can talk to someone close, maybe it will help you figure something out. It's so hard right now, I understand, but you have to go through it. It will get better.
Maybe try to distract yourself somehow, while you are trying to fall asleep. I listen to songs for example, when my mind is racing. I try to focus on the song, or try to make up some stories in my head.
Or try to move around a lot, so your body feels more tired. 
Or maybe some calming Tea could help? I don't know.
Talking to a therapist would be the best option I think.",t3_rqhe6v
hqagtj6,t3_rqhe6v,"Try to listen some ted talk of interesting podcast  before sleeping, when I have a lot of thinking and couldn't sleep I needed my mind to be occupied with something else following. It was a kind of bed time story for me.",t3_rqhe6v
hqcl2i1,t3_rqhe6v,"This may not work for you, but Iâ€™m conditioned to it at this point. I like to play a video game while laying down and after an hour, I want to fall right to sleep. 

Also, keeping a journal really helps me let it all out.",t3_rqhe6v
hqa5w4l,t3_rqhe6v,"hmm are you stressed about something?? for me, when it happens I know there would be an upcoming flashback (PTSD) or there's lots of problematic thoughts on my mind.",t3_rqhe6v
