hqs9dl5,t3_rt7utx,"Given how NPDs tend to be *imagistic* aphantasia shouldn't be common, but not necessarily excluded. That said if it were to occur it would be like any other non NPD necessitating symptom - purely conditional. Personally, I do not struggle to visualize by myself. I can imagine pretty surreal things easily. Any lagging and low resolution is due to cognitive impairment and just being human, not because of NPD. *But* I noticed I'm unlikely to imagine when reading anything or when people describe something to me. Yeah... books were never my thing. They're purely a verbal thing, not enjoyable. This could be because of really bad working memory and ability to multi task, but insecurity and a vicious tenacity to protect ""my world"" are probably additional factors. I think the aphantasia might be related with empathy impairment too. I noticed I have more visceral reactions when I visualize. Be these reactions sadistic glee or affective empathy. Possibly, this unwillingness to visualize is a subconscious tactic to disengage from others.

To test this yourself - are you truly incapable of visualizing? do you visualize when dreaming?",t3_rt7utx
hqsgr3h,t3_rt7utx,Im too deluded to understand whether i have exceptional visual capacities or poor,t3_rt7utx
hqtv57d,t3_rt7utx,"no its not a npd thing. its more like a personal thing. personally I dont have aphantasia

hqtm13b,t1_hqs9dl5,"Thank for your comment! It was very detailed and thought out :) well when I was younger I thought I had visual memory like everyone but I didnt really know what it was I guess. I wish I had visual memory like you lol. My memory is pretty poor too which makes sense if I cant visualize it's hard to form them. I can't visualize anything especially books. I didnt know others could. My minds eyes is ""blank"" I'm all verbal. I cant form images in my head at all. I know what my family members or friends look like, for example, but I dont see them in my head. I only know their characteristics like brown hair or short. I of course would be able to pick them out too in a large group of people but I dont see them in my head. I don't know if i can visualize when I'm dreaming? I can only remember who I dreamed of or what sorta (bits and pieces). I rarely remember my dreams now that I think of it.",t3_rt7utx
hqt1xa9,t1_hqsgr3h,"pretty easy to gauge. watch anything, literally anything. when you remember it, how quality is your mental reproduction of it?",t3_rt7utx
hqtwbeq,t1_hqtv57d,Hmm interesting,t3_rt7utx
hqw6rw5,t1_hqtv57d,"If you mean Autism Spectrum Disorder, I doubt that. Autistic people tend to actually be quite visual. Even when they are memory reliant they tend to have a search engine way of thinking. Autistic people tend to be alexithymic which can dampen imaginative ability, but eh, not the same thing.",t3_rt7utx
hqtk2lt,t1_hqt1xa9,Still need some comparative measure,t3_rt7utx
