hqelz8u,t3_rr3xwo,You probably won't be able to get rid of them until you figure out why your mind resorts to this kind of fantasizing. Most likely it's to cope with your vulnerable feelings and feel empowered. Seek empowerment from healthier sources.,t3_rr3xwo
hqebj1c,t3_rr3xwo,"Go back to your childhood trauma and whatever pain that has caused you to want to inflict pain on others.       Go back to your childhood and take responsibility for what has happened to you,.   Instead of putting the blame 100% on the people who have hurt you why not think of it as your karma perhaps.          Resolve the issues and whatever hurt that has made you into what you are today, because your fantasies are a reflection of unresolved anger and trauma from your past in order to get rid of those fantasies, recognize where it comes from.    Recognize that hurting others or even the fantasy of it, will not cure your past",t3_rr3xwo
hqejvpg,t3_rr3xwo,Why do you need to get rid of them? I feel it may be a bit comforting and as long as you dont act on them what's the harm? I sometimes think/fantasize about putting someone in their place if they've treated me badly or made me look bad. Not sure if that counts as cruel though,t3_rr3xwo
hqfgsvd,t3_rr3xwo,"I honestly don't see it as something that needs to be gotten rid of as long as you're not doing anything to the other person you have an issue with.

If someone tried that with me I would probably ignore them.  And I ignore people who insult me and put me down as well a lot now.  As well as people who read into things that don't necessarily mean anything.",t3_rr3xwo
hqh9mjr,t3_rr3xwo,Very common. Maybe some people can make it work but I realized I didn't want to be living in that kind of negative space all my life. It's a process to get over and I am still working at it but working on my self-worth and sense of self in therapy has been very helpful.,t3_rr3xwo
hqsj1qh,t3_rr3xwo,"Its because you feel powerless and want to feel powerful right? Usually that stuff has to do with feeling powerless, small and worthless and wanting to not feel that way anymore. Also wanting to feel like things are fair",t3_rr3xwo
hqg6kvf,t3_rr3xwo,Sounds look good ol revenge. Better to be the one who retaliates rather than initiate in my opinion,t3_rr3xwo
hqh9fus,t1_hqebj1c,"This! And have enough self compassion to see that your nervous system is functioning in hyperarousal in these situations. Regardless of what the other person is doing and their intentions, you are going into a fight/flight response where you feel it is necessary to fight in order to preserve yourself. It's a function of survival.",t3_rr3xwo
hqsjk0v,t1_hqsj1qh,"Yes, it's something like that. I do my best to gain as much power as I can, because I don't want anyone to control my life like people from my past used to do, so why I'm so obsessed with such fantasies",t3_rr3xwo
hqso2h4,t1_hqsjk0v,"So do you think you can get rid of the fantasy by acknowledging why you feel that way and finding another way to feel powerful?

Sometimes i also just want to hurt people because i feel like other people dont realise how much they hurt me or are dismissing my feelings and i want them to suffer so they will understand. It sucks when you are suffering and people just accuse you of being weak or exagerating.",t3_rr3xwo
hqsonhz,t1_hqso2h4,"Yes, I'm aware of it and always try to direct my thoughts to another place, but its not easy at all. 
I can relate a lot about pain, I've read in some psychology book that sociopaths and narcissists can only get rid of the trauma pain is to make someone else feel the same way that we used to, so it calms down the pain. But there are other healthy ways to smooth it, like saving people from same trauma, for example and tons of others",t3_rr3xwo
hqsq70n,t1_hqsonhz,Do you think the way to deal with it is to put yourself in different situations? Avoid people that humiliate you and surround yourself with people who care about you or who you can help?,t3_rr3xwo
hqsvsx3,t1_hqsq70n,"I think yes, it's very important. I avoid people who humiliate, insult or abuse me anyway. And I also do my best to change my attitude to people who used to act like this in my past. Put myself on their place, forgive and forget. I work with my therapist with it, I write statements that describe my attitude (like, ""people should only act this way"", ""everyone should treat me in a special manner"", ""the world is dangerous"" etc) and replace them with those that make me feel better about myself, traumas and other people (like ""everyone has a right on their opinion"", ""mistakes make me smarter"", ""every person deserves respect"" etc). And it really helps to perceive world in a positive way.",t3_rr3xwo
