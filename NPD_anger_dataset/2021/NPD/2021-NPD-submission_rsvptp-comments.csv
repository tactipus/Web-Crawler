hqps8mf,t3_rsvptp,"Thanks for bringing this up. Also if these sexual predators are making comments , requesting nude photos, and other forms of pornography from minors, it might be possible to get police involved depending on where the moderators live as well as where you live. This stuff is really not okay.",t3_rsvptp
hqqhn47,t3_rsvptp,"Lol I'm a part of npd 2.0

They seem like douchebags who want nothing more than to rot as narcissists so long as they can get away with their negative behaviors as long as no ""non-narcs"" irl catch them. They don't want to change, except to help themselves feel better. 

And, BTW, I've already been contacted by 2 predatorial seeming people. One of them being a mod.",t3_rsvptp
hqosau8,t3_rsvptp,What's he doing to these underage girls? Are they turning them into sex slaves? Why are underage girls talking to narcissist? Some girls like serial killers and some like old men.,t3_rsvptp

hqpuxay,t1_hqps8mf,"Thanks, that is in motion.",t3_rsvptp
hqqk10o,t1_hqqhn47,"So yeah the predatory person I mentioned isn’t in the “NPD Recovery 2.0” server. That person is a mod in the “r/NPD Official” server which is owned by u/Phteven_j who is aware of their explicitly sexual contact with underage girls yet allows them to maintain a position of trust in a server which has allowed children as young as 12 to participate in certain channels.

The “2.0” one which is owned by u/theinvisiblemonster is portrayed as recovery/support focused however as I have mentioned, the support is incredibly unequal with moderators - including teenagers under 18 given moderator status - prioritising their friends over people targeted by discrimination.

Their moderation in general is totally out of whack. When I was targeted by discrimination (as described in another comment I made on this post), I was informed that no warning would be given to those who took part, absolutely nothing would be said by any moderator to make clear that how I was treated was not okay as “it’s in the rules already that discrimination is not okay, I’m not a mommy, reach out to those people yourself and resolve it”. Which by the way for doing just that and reaching out to those people, a different (young teenage) moderator went mad at me for. Rules that aren’t enforced are not rules. Other statements, warnings and clarifications to rules were given regularly for other issues so this “resolve it yourself” approach was not the norm. This is effectively a statement that the discrimination I was treated to was tolerated and deemed okay by the people responsible for maintaining the integrity of their so-called “support space”. 

On the other hand, when someone well-intended responded to me with a supportive message they were reprimanded immediately for responding in an inappropriate channel, a rule which hasn’t been enforced for months back. Totally out of balance on what is enforced or not and would not accept any feedback that their moderators could try to communicate/use their capabilities more effectively. 

They’re all just playing their own individual game and not considering the responsibility they have and the people it affects unless it’s one of their own. Having the audacity to call it a support space when it’s run like that, given that vulnerable people with complex mental disorders and trauma could take them at their word and not realise that “support space” isn’t the truth, it’s actually quite dangerous.",t3_rsvptp
hqqlg9k,t1_hqqhn47,Also I’m really sorry that you’ve been targeted by predatory people from the 2.0 server too; that must’ve been a different person to the one I was aware of.,t3_rsvptp
hqoszok,t1_hqosau8,Why are you victim blaming?,t3_rsvptp
hqph8sh,t1_hqp7nav,"No they haven’t. It’s not an “itty bitty thing”.

1. Racist discrimination was targeted against me. 
Regardless of the heritage/background of the person who instigated that, they present as an English person, they have a fully English accent. The English committed literal and cultural genocide against the Scottish and Irish people (my heritage). Scottish people were literally burned out of their homes as a result of English-based landlords; our national dress, music and languages were made illegal. In schools children were beaten for speaking in Scots which continued until recently enough to be in the living memories of some people still alive today and the inter-generational trauma lingers from this with the stigmatisation of Scots language, and Scottish Gaelic almost dying out. The national anthem of the “union” of our countries has a line “rebellious Scots to crush”. Scottish people were seen as subhuman and facial/other appearance factors were historically ascribed to this “subhuman Scot” so it is indeed racial. So for an English presenting person to instigate that discrimination against me is not innocent banter, it is oppressive and hateful. 
2. Not only that, others continued to mock and provoke me after moderators asked for it to stop. Eg making references to the film *Trainspotting*, and continuing to do so even after seeing that I was directly responding to that acknowledging that it was being spoken about in order to mock me. 

Zero action was taken to warn anyone who took part in this. Rules are not rules if they are not enforced.

People have not been “walking on eggshells”, numerous people have continued to provoke and mock me following this. I apologised both publicly and directly to people who I had incorrectly shouted/gotten angry at. I have received zero acknowledgement that discriminatory behaviour was targeted at me. Moderators made it clear that they had no understanding of the context despite me explaining clearly why this was racial discrimination. One moderator just a few days prior had zero clue that my country even existed in its own right, having assumed it was *part of England*. This is not a small issue yet despite the fact that none of them understood the context to understand whether or not it was a serious issue of discrimination, they decided it was just fine to deem it an innocent miscommunication rather than correctly acknowledge it for what it was.",t3_rsvptp
hqp85jm,t1_hqp7nav,It’s literally all warped perception,t3_rsvptp
hqqkadb,t1_hqpuxay,That’s great to hear.,t3_rsvptp
hquev0f,t1_hqqk10o,"Hello, I don’t come on Reddit often but I am an admin in NPD Recovery and this post was brought to my attention. I just wanted to clarify a few things about our server. First, being that we have no moderators or admins that are under 18 and everyone who is an admin is an adult. Not sure where you got that from. Secondly, we do not treat people unfairly nor did we treat you unfairly, we do not prioritize friends over people targeted by discrimination. Third, you were NOT being discriminated against. You came into voice chat, drunk, heard someone with a British accent and immediately started talking about Scotland vs. England, YELLING, which no one wanted to hear. I asked you 3 times to stop before I muted you and disconnected you from the call. This has gone way too far. You spammed the intake channel at least 40 times today, you have been actually racist to another member in a different server where you were still talking about this situation, by the way you have been going on about this dming members and admins on different platforms since December 28th. You need to stop. You were not discriminated against, you started a conversation by yelling and did not stop when asked. You were drunk and probably do not remember but you are not thinking about any of this clearly. Also, you were in the channel strictly for venting, people are not supposed to reply in that channel. Another admin who wasn’t even active to see any of what happened DAYS ago, said please don’t reply in this channel. That’s it. Stop trash talking the server and stop lying. Stop harassing members and admins of NPD Recovery. Thank you.",t3_rsvptp
hqprt5x,t1_hqoszok,Probably because he’s a pedo himself.,t3_rsvptp
hqqspjj,t1_hqoszok,I didn't consider them victims. Victims of what? Guy trying to hit on them. It's a daily occurrence.,t3_rsvptp
hqqssd7,t1_hqoszok,The whole question was to ascertain if they were actually victims to which I got no reply.,t3_rsvptp
hqprt4y,t1_hqph8sh,Thank you for sharing this and providing history on how the English oppressed the Scottish. I didn’t have a lot of knowledge on this and it looks like a genuine case of racial discrimination. Especially with how specific those references were to films around that. I’m sorry this happened to you and that it’s not being considered serious.,t3_rsvptp
hqpiyxe,t1_hqph8sh,I only want to defend the server from absurd accusations like those. That was my statement. To your comment: TLDR,t3_rsvptp
hr7isyv,t1_hquev0f,"You know this is a group of very hateful people who will find out who is vulnerable to use for their own entertainment. That is what happened here and it was very clear to see how nobody involved had any intention to be fair about the situation. The person who invited me to the server (“invisible monster”) initially started out interacting with me in a very hateful way telling me she had no respect for me whatsoever. Very gradually she framed this to become some mistaken way of “protecting” me and created a false friendship. She saw that I was very traumatised and likely to get very upset when being bullied by a group as this had happened before. Then she decided to create an invitation for me on the other server which she owned. This is where she continued to create this false image of a friendship to me whereas the reality was I was there to be used as entertainment when they would bully me. They found it funny to see me get upset. Notice how on the incident which occurred, numerous people were deliberately making discriminatory comments against my nationality which were intended to upset me. The people in charge not only did not admonish this behaviour but took part in it and encouraged it. 

This is why I wrote the post originally to warn anyone from joining these places. YOU WILL BE USED LIKE A CAT PLAYS WITH ITS FOOD BEFORE EATING FOR ENTERTAINMENT.",t3_rsvptp
hqufwac,t1_hquev0f,"Leave me alone. Your attitude to this is completely disgusting, don’t tell me what isn’t discriminatory against me when you didn’t even know my country existed until a few days ago. The English person literally made a racist remark against Scotland which is what initiated the incident. Regardless of his personal heritage that is wrong. You not having the cultural understanding of the context to understand the remark he made to me does not make it okay. You have absolutely no right to tell me that how he and others treated me that night was not racist. People deliberately continued to provoke me well after you requested it to stop, I was the only person who had any action taken against them despite other people continuing to provoke a reaction from me for their own amusement. I made a comparison to make it clear to one of the people involved why that was racial discrimination, because that person continued to make comments about me in the other server and refused to acknowledge their part in the bullying against me.

I was trying to get admin’s attention earlier today because they left me at risk leaving personally identifiable information about me visible and giving me no way to remove it. That placed me in a dangerous situation so I urgently needed them to confirm it was removed. The last message I initiated to anyone was prior to when August resolved it by confirming the images were removed. I have no interest in the situation beyond that other than to warn people that the server is not the supportive space it claims to be, only towards those chosen by moderators as friends. It is in fact harmful to promote it as a support space given the biased way in which moderators act. Which I have done with this post. Therefore there is nothing further to be said about it so at this point it is you who is unnecessarily contacting me.",t3_rsvptp
hqqukps,t1_hqqspjj,"Sexual harassment of children (or adults) being a daily occurrence does not make it okay. That’s what “being hit on” is: sexual harassment. A child cannot give consent to sexual activity,  “consent” given by a child is not valid. 
The person mentioned has been regularly involved in explicit sexual activity with children, including at least making plans to sexually assault them in person.",t3_rsvptp

hqpknlr,t1_hqpk49p,You have wild perception issues. I won’t discuss with you easy as that. We tried reaching you but you are so disordered right now it’s not possible. You spammed like 5 people with messages non stop,t3_rsvptp
hqul2rp,t1_hqukv0y,I asked her to leave me alone because she is continuing that awful attitude of dismissing the discrimination I was targeted by. I don’t have to tolerate someone doing that to me. Neither is your continued input and harassing me in DMs here appropriate.,t3_rsvptp
hqqvaut,t1_hqqv4t1,We’re talking about children here. An adult has no business involving a child in any form of sexual activity.,t3_rsvptp
hqplvs2,t1_hqpknlr,"I was directed to reach out to people who had taken part in this situation. Some were perfectly able to understand what they did wrong and resolve but on the other hand I also received further discrimination and mocking such as the attitude you have displayed here, downplaying an incident of racial discrimination as me having a personal issue with perception is absolutely disgusting.",t3_rsvptp
hqulc81,t1_hqul2rp,Well you are also dismissive. Plus if you don’t want to be harassed maybe you shouldn’t clinge to things like that. Plus I never harassed you in dms. Only told you I don’t care what you want.,t3_rsvptp

hquos3s,t1_hqulc81,"> if you don’t want to be harassed maybe you shouldn’t…

^ dude the above sentence is quite literally victim blaming. There is nothing that justifies you harassing me. I told you very clearly that your messages were inappropriate yet you continued to message. That is harassment - me messaging people as directed by Invisible-Monster is not.",t3_rsvptp
