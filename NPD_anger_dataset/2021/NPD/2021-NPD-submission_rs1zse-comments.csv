hqjrhs6,t3_rs1zse,"I think Psychiatry is another but I'm not sure (also with ASPD).  I don't think that's always a bad thing because sometimes Psychiatrists do need to make hard decisions in a unemotional way.  And they have to be prepared to make those decisions and be disliked for that by the patient.  Even if it really is in the patients best interest so they don't hurt themselves or anyone else.

And that's not an easy thing.  And that decision making power is abused a lot of the time.  But you can't deny that sometimes people need someone else to make decisions for them.",t3_rs1zse

hqsio9s,t1_hqlnrzp,Dont doctors go through a lot of interviews to make sure they dont have mental heslth challenges before being accepted to med school?,t3_rs1zse
hqsvhw3,t1_hqsio9s,"Well if they do I'm confident (lol) I'll be fine, I mean, if anything doesn't get me the job it'll be the ADHD, or the autism, or probably the OSDd-1b.

I don't think my mental disorders get in the way of properly asessing another's health, they only get in the way of my mental health and I've been working very hard since I was 15 to have proper coping and grounding methods. I don't really want to be a psychologist or a therapist anyway—I want to be a psychiatrist, someone who mostly diagnoses and prescribes medication.

My thoughts on it is that the psychology field could use more ND people with an unbiased view on mental health in it.

It would really suck if I've been struggling this entire time to get a single diagnoses and I end up getting all of them via rejection a la med school. Lol.",t3_rs1zse
