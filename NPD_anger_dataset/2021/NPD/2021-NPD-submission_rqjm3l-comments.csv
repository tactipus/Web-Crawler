hqakeso,t3_rqjm3l,Get a new psychologist. I got diagnosed with ASPD and NPD while being aware of it.,t3_rqjm3l
hqap3es,t3_rqjm3l,"Find a therapist who is specialized in personality pathology, or on one of the treatment modalities created specifically for personality pathology (schema therapy, mentalization-based therapy, DBT...). 

I mean it's possible that you don't have NPD, but that sort of blanket statement is questionable. It's true that pwNPD tend to have little self-awareness (those of us in the sub are not a representative sample) but I'd say someone who is familiarized with personality disorders would be more cautious about generalizing this way.",t3_rqjm3l
hqakxpa,t3_rqjm3l,There is a major misconception that NPD cannot possibly be self-aware before diagnosis. Being aware does not change maladaptive behaviors and patterns that clearly fall within the criteria.,t3_rqjm3l
hqapnz1,t3_rqjm3l,She isn’t very good. Get a new psychologist.,t3_rqjm3l
hqc9ei9,t3_rqjm3l,A personality disorder is a pretty heavy diagnosis with a lot of stigma. Maybe she's hoping she can help you reverse these tendencies before it crosses a line. Or maybe she is eyeing a different diagnosis all together that you do not exhibit self awareness of.,t3_rqjm3l
hqbeo1l,t3_rqjm3l,"Find a new psychologist. In my personal experience, many mental health professionals are not very familiar with the intricacies of personality disorders. I was misdiagnosed for years until I found a therapist that specialized in mentalization-based therapy.",t3_rqjm3l
hqbkiq2,t3_rqjm3l,"I got told i cant have ASPD because i dont commit crime, even tho i fit most the diagnostic criteria so i relate, luckily i do have NPD diagnosed",t3_rqjm3l
hqbn4od,t3_rqjm3l,"Strange.

Perhaps, if the situation arises again ask what diagnostic criteria she is basing this 'self-awareness' stance on.",t3_rqjm3l
hqbuoa7,t3_rqjm3l,This is 100% how I feel,t3_rqjm3l
hqde079,t3_rqjm3l,Lol. She must think this is some kind of movie. Dump her and get someone else,t3_rqjm3l
hqslyvi,t3_rqjm3l,"I went to see several therapists who told me that i dont have npd because i'm self aware and dont act like i have npd.
I told a therapist that i'm trying really hard to control myself but usually i interrupt people, argue and talk down to people. After that he agreed that i probably have npd :)",t3_rqjm3l
hqali4v,t3_rqjm3l,"Wait, why would you want it on papers that you have NPD",t3_rqjm3l
hqecwa3,t3_rqjm3l,Why do you want to be labeled?,t3_rqjm3l
hqem3ke,t3_rqjm3l,"pwNPD have poor awareness of their own thinking, yes. But that doesn't mean you can't be aware enough to know you have a PD. There's a reason that obliviousness is not a diagnostic criterion.",t3_rqjm3l
hqemx5f,t3_rqjm3l,Don't worry fam. You don't need a psychologist to diagnose you. I diagnose you with narcissism 😁 You're welcome,t3_rqjm3l
hqep46h,t3_rqjm3l,What...they don't teach about nuance and critical thinking down at the female witchcraft school? Shocking. I'm sure they gave her a certificate that proves her ability.,t3_rqjm3l
hqbep12,t3_rqjm3l,"People with NPD can't be aware of it. I am 100% convinced of it. It's essentially a dissociative disorder.  

I also really think your eagerness to have NPD is an indication you don't have NPD. Someone with NPD wouldn't want to be diagnosed with it. That would mean there was something seriously wrong with them. People with NPD *do not think* there is something seriously wrong with them. They think there is something seriously wrong with people they are in conflict with. In fact, they project they're NPD traits onto others, while they themselves remain totally unaware of this process.",t3_rqjm3l
hqbcgny,t1_hqakeso,Thank you. I am definitely considering it.,t3_rqjm3l
hqbd6ge,t1_hqap3es,Ty for the insight. I’ll keep these in mind.,t3_rqjm3l
hqbckeb,t1_hqakxpa,Agreed! Gotta tell that to my psychologist lol,t3_rqjm3l
hqbcr3h,t1_hqapnz1,I’m looking for one online. It is so tiring to start over. But yeah sometimes you gotta.,t3_rqjm3l
hqecyzn,t1_hqc9ei9,This,t3_rqjm3l
hqcvo84,t1_hqbuoa7,Same 😉,t3_rqjm3l
hqb8yh8,t1_hqali4v,"- If you want to start medication for any NPD symptoms, your psychiatrist has an actual list to keep in mind when prescribing you meds. For example, we typically get angry very easily so the psychologist would avoid prescribing an anti-depressant that causes an increased irritability.
- A lot of psychologists just do not take patients with NPD, and if you're already diagnosed then it saves time of having to deal with them.
- Unfortunately, some therapists will try to encourage you to start CBT and mindfulness first before moving onto more complex therapies. CBT and mindfulness tend to do absolutely nothing for NPD, so if your therapist already knows you have it then they won't waste time trying to make you go through therapies that do nothing for you before getting to the good stuff.
- Validation that your guess about you having NPD was accurate
- Being able to say ""yes, I'm diagnosed"" when an empath doesn't believe you have NPD because you are capable of being a kind person with good intentions",t3_rqjm3l
hqbiebk,t1_hqbep12,"“People with NPD can’t be aware of it”
I totally disagree. People can become aware from introspection & research. Some people are very self reflective. This nonsense that people with NPD cannot be self aware is just plain wrong.",t3_rqjm3l
hqbib8n,t1_hqbep12,"Can you explain why you are 100% convinced people with NPD can’t be aware of it? You said it’s essentially a dissociative disorder. I and dsm-v have to disagree. Dissociating can be used as a coping mechanism and since personality disorders usually comes from some kind of traumatic background it is a very commonly used coping mechanism. But you are aware of yourself, of who you are, what you do (except for maybe delusions of grandeur etc. but they come and go in form of episodes, and are not constant). Essentially dissociative disorders would be did, dpdr and dissociative amnesia. Also you can’t determine whether or not i have npd from one reddit post. I am not looking for other people to diagnose me or not diagnose me. I am looking for insight on what should i do next.",t3_rqjm3l
hqbolev,t1_hqbep12,"You are absolutely wrong.

Narcissists do think there is something seriously wrong with them. They often think of themselves as broken dipshits.

It's called object inconstancy or black and white thinking. Overexaggerating in either direction.

Just search for ""I'm pathetic"" on this sub. You'll get hundreds of posts from diagnosed ones.

You should stop talking about things that you have no idea about.",t3_rqjm3l
hqcrwkn,t1_hqbep12,"Yes, I agree. If they even believed they had real flaws they would not be a narcissist. Narcissists live in a complete fantasy world about who they are and usually do not become self aware on their own. Even when diagnosed rarely do they accept a diagnosis that would be the antithesis of who they think they are. I think a lot of people in this sub think they have NPD but are mistaken. Gonna make some people angry,  but it needs to be said.",t3_rqjm3l

hqbcxet,t1_hqb8yh8,I wanna see more upvotes for this comment. Based af.,t3_rqjm3l
hqbkug0,t1_hqbiebk,Then we disagree.,t3_rqjm3l
hqbkrnw,t1_hqbib8n,"All I can say is you should look into the history of how they came up with the diagnostic criteria for NPD in the DSM. It was very controversial.  

>I am looking for insight on what should i do next.

Well you should psychiatrist shop until you find one that does what you want obviously. I mean, that's the only your answer your going to accept since you vehemently disagree with anyone that takes your psychiatrists side in this.  

I have no idea why you are so eager to be diagnosed with NPD.",t3_rqjm3l
hqbpm9v,t1_hqbolev,">Just search for ""I'm pathetic"" on this sub. You'll get hundreds of posts from diagnosed ones.

I think this sub would be a horrible place to sample people that actually have NPD. 

To listen to the most vocal on this sub NPD is actually having a really bad self-image. It's asinine.    

You're mostly just a bunch of people with shitty social skills.    

People with NPD think its other people that have the problem. I really don't get why you all have such a difficult time accepting this. Most of you seem to have problems with autism not NPD, and I guess its easier for you to diagnosis yourselves with NPD for some reason?",t3_rqjm3l
hqcv30c,t1_hqcrwkn,Maybe people with npd dont always accept it because the world starts to look very depressing and bleak when you realize you have it. I dont wanna believe I have flaws but I know I do and even now that I'm self aware I still have the same patterns of thinking and behaviors (it's just hidden) but the urges are still there and they're very hard to fight. Just wanted to offer some perspective :) living in the fantasy world helps you live and not commit suicide (sorry for being depressing) but it's the truth at least for me,t3_rqjm3l
hqbns82,t1_hqbkrnw,"Because he's a Narcissist, god damnit.

Try to invalidate a Narcissist on anything and see what happens. Fool.

DSM is toilet paper when it comes to NPD. The official criteria do not cover vulnerable narcissism whatsoever.",t3_rqjm3l
hqcnugz,t1_hqbpm9v,">You're mostly just a bunch of people with shitty social skills. Again

This goes for a lot of personality disorder subs, subs to do with ASPD are the same. Just immature, socially inept people who don't want to admit the truth and instead over intellectualise their problems. Must be a load off to get a fancy diagnostic label and be absolved of your indiscretions as if you've been to a confession.",t3_rqjm3l
