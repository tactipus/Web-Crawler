hq8yuho,t3_rq8ip9,I was bullied and beaten by my father and emotionly neglected and beaten by my mother there were only conditional rewards and just punishment for wrong never praise for success,t3_rq8ip9
hq9h3be,t3_rq8ip9,"The weird thing about my case is that I never suffered any trauma or hardship at all. I had an embarrassingly nice childhood. The reason why I say embarrassing is because a lot of people with NPD tend to develop it through a significant trauma whereas I had a really nice middle class upbringing. (I'm fully aware that people with NPD can idealize their childhoods but I genuinely believe I was brought up in a very privileged environment.)

I believe my disorder was inherited genetically from my mother's side of the family. Her brothers were very withdrawn and reclusive which is something I suffer greatly from.

It's worth mentioning that I suffer more from vulnerable narcissism/quiet borderline.",t3_rq8ip9
hq8ygrc,t3_rq8ip9,"I recently remembered that i was left with my grandparents for close to a year when I was 2-3 yo, when my mum was pregnant with my younger brother. I believe this mainly led to my lack of object constancy",t3_rq8ip9
hqcmmiu,t3_rq8ip9,Endless compliments and excessive emotional and behavioral expectations from my parents. My entire life consisted of being only entirely good or entirely bad. I had to be everything my parents wanted me to be. So I pretty much lost myself entirely.,t3_rq8ip9
hqb5n93,t3_rq8ip9,"My parents idealised me when I achieved some success in studying, for example, and felt disgusted if I fail or didn't meet their expectations. They always compared me to other kids and insulted me for being skinny, dumb or inadequate. They told me that no one will ever fall in love with me because of my disadvantages, inability to always keep clean my room, for not doing sport,  avoiding some people they liked, etc. on the other hand, when I achieved something, they told me that I'm the best and one day I'm going to be a great person. So it made me arrogant, and my classmates bullied me for that and made fun of such a haughty behavior. So it made me feel like I only can be loved and accepted by society when I'm perfect and best in everything I do.",t3_rq8ip9
hqcouk4,t3_rq8ip9,"The messaging I got from my dad was always something like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre better than everyone else,‚Äù and whenever I screwed up as a kid, he would shame me for letting people who I was ‚Äúbetter‚Äù than outperform me.

I think this kind of inconsistent messaging is very common among us.",t3_rq8ip9
hqcv3fb,t3_rq8ip9,"Dad tried to turn me into a professional tennis player. And my life was dedicated to it until about 12/ 13, and he saw my leaving me it as a betrayal of him and further emotionally abandoned me. He would also constantly physically intimidate me into submitting to him.  

My experience of my mother, looking back, was quite simply deranged üòÇ. I think quite possibly BPD. She was obsessed with seeing herself as the perfect mother. However, the veil would often slip, and she would then become physical, verbally and/ or emotionally abusive, then forget about it.

Also, my mum got ME for a year when I was 2, so i didn't see her for like a year. I remember knocking on her door begging her to come and spend time with me, but nothing happening. So, there was a lot of emotional neglect.

My 'friends' at all levels of school bullied me a lot. Mostly via ridicule/ mocking. It was so pervasive that I literally didn't even realise I was being bullied until around my early 20s, because I was treated so badly by so many people.",t3_rq8ip9
hq9xpvh,t3_rq8ip9,"i was neglected at early childhood, my mother worked while my dad ""took care"" of me (didnt do shit). my parents were divorced for as long as i can think, they fought a lot when i was younger, with eachother and with me, especially my father,(who has npd). he also beat me, but not too often.
as punishment they sometimes just locked me in my room for several hours.

later i got bullied a lot in school, whenever i tried to talk about it with my family they ignored or laughed at me, (which they did for pretty much everything). the mentality in the family was to be ""tough"", they rarely praised and criticized a lot.

as a teen i tried committing suicide once and got laughed at too when they found out. thats when i was convinced that my family didnt love me, and the symptoms became worse, especially the anger and splitting.

the memories are burried, thats true, most of them only resurface if i really really think, like having to dive to the bottom of a deep pool, or if i see an object/place that reminds me of an event.",t3_rq8ip9
hqd3rqb,t3_rq8ip9,"Ugh I‚Äôm so over ‚Äútrauma‚Äù being the latest pop psychology speak. Ya‚Äôll, it‚Äôs called ‚Äúattachment injury.‚Äù Attachment injuries are what give us narcissism. Usually, it‚Äôs attachment injury + temperament. For me, my dad left me for 3 months to work in the U.S., and then I immigrated to the U.S. (both attachment injuries) on top of that, I was born with a horrible temperament - I could NOT self soothe when my mom dropped me off for school trips.

A lot of kids of people in the army have narcissism bc they move around a lot. Notably, moving to China is an attachment injury Kanye got at age 7 that led him to have narcissism. Listen to the Psychology in Seattle episode. 

Enough with the ‚Äúsearching for trauma of abuse.‚Äù It doesn‚Äôt necessarily have to be that.",t3_rq8ip9
hqdas66,t3_rq8ip9, I grew up with a BPD with NPD and I was constantly put down to the point I lost all my self esteem and confidence. Anytime I would get upset I was told I can not be upset because there is nothing to be upset about( being pretty and skinny) meant everything to them. I started to hide my emotions and anytime asked if I was alright it was always ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine‚Äù. I believe I have traits and I‚Äôm working through them.,t3_rq8ip9

hqalr1u,t3_rq8ip9,"Few things for me.

1. being a fucking total loser & weirdo growing up never fitting in and needing SOMEWAY to defend myself

2. terrible parents who didn‚Äôt show me anything about the real world. would use me as collateral and or their therapist. 

3. toxic relationships in high school gave me a bad image of how relationships and sex are supposed to work and made it easy for sex to equal my value as a person.",t3_rq8ip9
hqazzka,t3_rq8ip9,"A emotionally unavailable father who exhibited narcissistic traits, he was a disciplinarian who never said he was proud or loved us. He left when I was 9 years old.

My mom was a manipulative person who installed lying and be deceptive as a value, she taught us that being sneaky and getting what you want makes you a better person than others. That to be superior you had to screw others and get yours, otherwise the world would eat us alive.

I‚Äôm not diagnosed NPD nor do I think I have it, I did exhibit strong narcissistic traits in my teen and young adult years that I recovering from.",t3_rq8ip9
hq90a8s,t3_rq8ip9,"My ex used to say - she looks like her dad, not beautiful like her mother and next sister. The only person who gave her love was her grandmother and he died. She wasn't neglected though, and she proved herself and went to a medical college, then her narcissistic level increased. But, when we got married, I was from middle class family and also a doctor, but have no car, just a simple house detached from my family house; her sister got accepted at engineering school and from her first year got married from a Professor. Such conflict left my ex to compare and to level up the attention, needing more love, more fight, more comparison... Etc
Just saying!",t3_rq8ip9

hqa9i08,t3_rq8ip9,"Honestly just my parents not being emotionally available or giving me any attention at all, I was living with my cousin who gave me most of the attention and love a child needs but she wasn‚Äôt my parents which I guess made me develop this crazy disorder",t3_rq8ip9
hqai92c,t3_rq8ip9,i had one parent and one sibling who were both physically and emotionally abusive and another parent and sibling who were both constantly giving me external praise (but both were also easily angered). i was constantly made fun of for being the one academically poor child and for never having any awards n such (i live in asia you can imagine how embarrassed and ashamed i felt). i was depressed all my childhood and my family were emotionally negligent of that,t3_rq8ip9
hqasb06,t3_rq8ip9,"My mom was very inconsistent, she was neglectful and controlling, she isolated me for years. 

A very common manipulation technique she would use was to make me feel above the world with compliments. My mom would tell me that I was extremely beautiful, smart, special, to a god like level, and then would withdraw all these compliments when she was disappointed in me, wich was a lot of times because her expectations of me was to be exactly like her.

That woman was the only person in my life for 2-3 years and I think these years shaped my self image, wich is very inconsistent. (Sometimes I'm a goddess and sometimes I'm absolutely nothing.)",t3_rq8ip9

hqbdbgz,t3_rq8ip9,"I got beaten by my parents, they were emotionally detached and I was very lonely during my childhood. I also always had the feeling that they didn't really want me. Also no words of praise, only criticism. 

I have no idea about my authentic self. I suppressed a lot for the last 15 years, maybe even more. I went to therapy this year and I'm slowly starting to feel more emotions again. But I think my true self will always be hidden from most people. If I like someone enough, they will get to know my true self :)",t3_rq8ip9
hqcwr87,t1_hq8yuho,This is hard to read üòî I'm sorry you went through this,t3_rq8ip9
hq9hv9b,t1_hq9h3be,same here. I‚Äôve learned in psychology that you can experience perceived trauma. As i child i was never abused but my parents were quite strict so that may have given my youthful mind such ‚Äúperceived trauma‚Äù. At least that‚Äôs my theory,t3_rq8ip9
hq9s2o0,t1_hq9h3be,The fact that talk about privilege and not about warmth is pretty striking. Did your parents hold you and tell you they loved you?,t3_rq8ip9
hq9vzx4,t1_hq9h3be,"Same here. I just hit 14, had my first romantic disappointment and became a abusive jerk.

I was not bullied, abused, neglected or deprived. At least not in a significant way. I think in my case it's mostly genetics.

But even without trauma there are things that I think contributed to my narcissism:
* Having been gifted and being told by adults around me from a young age that I was a genius, that I could become whatever I wanted, etc (and then the praise stopping after reaching certain age).
* Being a gifted child probably contributed to not developing people skills since I was at a different maturity level than my peers for most of my childhood.
* Also being given responsibilities that weren't appropriate for my age and being praised for being mature and independent (made me feel shame for asking for help or being emotional).
* Now that I'm an adult I see that my parents have flaws that probably weren't the best for the development of someone with my personality (for example, they're pretty emotionally dumb and I would've benefited from getting help with learning to recognize and regulate my emotions). I don't think it constitutes trauma or abuse. I just think we're a bad match.
* After losing my shit in my teens, a lot of people (friends and boyfriends) enabled my behavior for years.",t3_rq8ip9
hqd348s,t1_hq9h3be,"It‚Äôs not just ‚Äútrauma.‚Äù It‚Äôs temperament + trauma usually, but it can also just be all temperament. Were you able to self soothe when you parents dropped you off at preschool?",t3_rq8ip9
hqeqmcd,t1_hq8ygrc,"I'm still struggling to understand Object Relations Theory so I'm not sure what you mean by ""object constancy"". You consider your mother in this case to be a significant object and because she wasn't there for you when you were a toddler this led to a lack of object constancy?   
How does this contribute to someone developing a personality disorder though? I don't get it.",t3_rq8ip9
hqc3bva,t1_hq9wfai,It'd be interesting to read your recovery story as a CSA survivor,t3_rq8ip9
hqc348t,t1_hqbdbgz,"Interesting, so you know your true self? I was under the impression that it was not possible to access the true self",t3_rq8ip9
hq9mbad,t1_hq9hv9b,"This is interesting. Does the term ""perceived trauma"" imply that the trauma is imagined and has no weight or merit behind it?",t3_rq8ip9
hqcwz4r,t1_hq9hv9b,My mom was strict and I feel I was an overly sensitive child and also bratty. My dad was I believe npd (had traits) and he was lax. I probably had percieved trauma since my mom was kinda emotionally distant,t3_rq8ip9
hqc37ma,t1_hq9s2o0,"They were very loving parents and made it very clear through their actions that they loved and cared for me very much especially as a child. Maybe I should have mentioned this in my previous comment?

hqbbg65,t1_hq9mbad,"Well perceived trauma is very subjective, not that it has no merit or weight, but it can very from person to person. It‚Äôs likely why theoretically if my parents had 10 kids 9/10 kids would turn out neurotypical and i would be the only one who had a personality disorder. Because i felt and reacted to their parenting in a different way than my siblings did. Even if they weren‚Äôt abusive and terrible parents that wasn‚Äôt the way i saw it in my childhood.",t3_rq8ip9
hqc5e0f,t1_hqc3jb9,"My ex-wife has NPD, and I feel like I never got to know her true self. And we spent a lot of time together. I was very surprised at the end of our marriage not recognizing her at all, feeling like I never got to know her. Maybe she didn't feel safe to show her true self... who knows, but she never did. It's a very shocking and disturbing realization. Also, it has to be exhausting for her to keep the mask... but who knows, I can try to relate, but I really don't understand how it might feel",t3_rq8ip9
