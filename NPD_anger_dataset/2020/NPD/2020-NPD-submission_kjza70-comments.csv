ggzv35h,t3_kjza70,"if it was genuinely a joke, I have plenty of friend's with low self esteems who do that and competitive people in general joke around like that and doesn't fit everyones sense of humor and that is okay. That being said, being narcissistic isn't necessarily a bad thing, it's only bad when you impose it on other people and make them feel bad about themselves. It's when you do it with no regard of others. A genuine sense of superiority I think can make you less empathetic. You can try humbling yourself without shaming yourself. I often judge other people in my head so when I feel that I'm doing so I tell myself I'm wrong, it's okay that I feel this way, but it isn't reality and theres nothing wrong with this person and theres nothing wrong with me. Maybe that could possibly benefit you? How would you feel if you didn't think you were better than everyone else? Would you feel bad being average? would you feel bad being below?",t3_kjza70
gh1gucm,t3_kjza70,"Ok, so some key points for you:

\- This is totally normal and ok; many millions of people have had similar insights about themselves and have worked to correct themselves, and it is rare to find a person that has never had to do anything like this in any aspect of their lives.

\- After some light stalking, you're relatively young in the scheme of things; as other posters have mentioned your personality generally doesn't settle down until your mid-20s, so plenty of time to grow with this new insight!

\- NPD is a spectrum and there are many times more people with ""traits"" than there are people with the full-blown disorder. Two helpful root causes to investigate are whether you are able to properly reconcile negative aspects of yourself (whole object psychological theory) and whether you are in the habit of ""putting love"" in other people (which you may have been conditioned out of due to your immediate family or social circle not rewarding this behaviour). Being conscious of both will go a long way towards building better habits over time, which will in turn shape your personality to something more acceptable.

\- Accept that recovery from NPD/traits is not like, for instance, medical surgery where the diagnosis is key, the operation takes a few hours and then it's a couple of weeks of healing. It's more like fixing your posture as if you've been leaning forward your entire life; it takes time, will not happen overnight and will necessarily involve a lot of re-learning things you didn't realise were related (good standing posture, sitting posture, sleeping posture, walking posture, etc etc). This is also ok and normal.

\- There are healthy and unhealthy ways of engaging with anything, including your existing hobbies. Just because you think (and I stress this, it takes time to form a fair assessment of the role a habit plays in your life) that programming and drawing are things to be avoided because they make you feel better than everyone, does not mean that they need to be.

\- Keep it honest with yourself, and your internal dialogue. It's a bit different for a teen because some idealism and grandiosity is perfectly normal at that age, but generally speaking try to stay aware of when you're drifting into world-spanning conspiracies to salve a bruised ego and try to replace it with something a little more grounded.

Good luck in your journey - you've already taken the first and most important step, and it's also perfectly normal to feel like a bit of a nonce looking back at your immature self; don't let that get you down!",t3_kjza70
gh2i59j,t3_kjza70,"I get you. This ""variant"" of narcissism you are describing is either compensatory or elitist. Elitist basically has rigid narcissism that already makes them feel great about themselves, but wants to add to that even more in the form of self enhancement or egotistical pursuits. Compensatory is basically an avoidant, who relies solely on, i guess, imagination, denying faults, and self enhancement to base their self worth on, with nothing to fall back on, they basically over estimate themselves to cover up a sense of deficiency and shame--I am great at everything because deep down I believe I am nothing. Like not too long ago (comp narc here) I took an IQ test and it came back a little lower than I had hoped, still in the normal range, but still a few points lower. I suddenly felt massive shame and emotional dysregulation as something I based my worth on wasn't exact, and it messed.me.up for the rest of the day. That's it, ""puffing up"" your esteem, or as my gf called it, ""self aimed"" when describing listening to a song which you relate to yourself, like aiming the music to yourself in a self inflating way. Like when I was younger I liked to think of myself as a superhero, because deep down I probably thought i was nothing

Anyway, comp narcs have basically no real self esteem so rely almost exclusively on ""outer things"" or attributes to make them, well, like themselves, if you follow. They also have a hard time dealing with faults, or flaws in the self because, that's what their worth as a human being is based on, true story.

Hope this helped, still don't see what that has to do with being like a bad person or whatever. Anyway do you think you could mention what sort of like symptoms you had related to awareness? Like did you feel anxious or disturbed? Did you just suddenly become aware of like ""who and what you are"" like I heard someone else say on here. Like I don't completely get how having narcissism is like a ""evil"" thing.",t3_kjza70
ggzk51s,t3_kjza70,"/u/falsemc, I have found an error in your post:

 > “think I'm better ~~then~~ [**than**] everyone”

I aver that you, falsemc, typed a solecism and could write “think I'm better ~~then~~ [**than**] everyone” instead. Unlike the adverb ‘then’, ‘than’ compares.
