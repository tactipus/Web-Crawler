gh0vygo,t3_kk45og,"yes I was thinking about posting something similar. Id like to hear from more people on this. I can relate to this. It's apathy which is a sign of anxiety and depression. Narcs suffer from anxiety and depression too because of shame I believe. That is my understanding on this topic anyway. Check out this article.

gh12l5p,t1_gh0vygo,"I've started to contest the thought I'll never be able to have a healthy, loving relationship by thinking instead that someone might want to be with me despite my current negative outlook in life and imperfections. It's hard, nearly unbelievable. We'll see what happens.",t3_kk45og

It's hard, right ‚ù§ but you are definitely on the right track. You are, at your core, a kind and good person, totally deserving of love. It may take some time, but being open to seeing that possibility for yourself, you'll start to have moments in life where you actually experience the truth of those words. Life lessons, people you meet, places you go, thoughts you have - really could be *anything*. Keep your eyes peeled and heart open :)

Keep going to therapy, keep searching for answers. You're not defective, or broken, or beyond repair. **You are loving and lovable, and have so much to give**

I wish for you many happy, smiling moments, and warm returns. All the love you have been waiting for - may you find it. May love teach you many beautiful things about the world and about yourself ‚ù§

It's a marathon, not a sprint üíô

Keep smiling, keep going :)",t3_kk45og
