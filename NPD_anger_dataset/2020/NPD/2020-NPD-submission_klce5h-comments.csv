gh873go,t3_klce5h,"Sounds like it could be some BPD traits. NPD generally has a more stable sense of self, and clear triggers are present when mood shifts. 

I get the same insecurities. Try not to blame your partner, but I do recommend asking them for more affirmation. If possible, schedule out your day how you believe you should - a few hours study, a couple hours exercise, an hour food prep etc. If you do this you'll have a quick reminder of how you are improving your life, and any insecurities that pop up can be met with ""Yeah but not for long"". Also, the bane of depression is a timetable.",t3_klce5h
gh8mzok,t3_klce5h,Your fiancé is wondering why your w him to trust me. My exes have proven they would rather be w a better looking guy bc they’ve all cheated on me. So maybe you ask yourself how you’ve denigrated you’re man. Has calling him ugly or stupid or fat made you feel better about yiur narc self?,t3_klce5h
gh8bqs2,t1_gh873go,"I don’t really see any BPD traits, honestly. Most of the time I feel pretty great about myself, but I just feel extremely insecure occasionally. My goals/ambitions stay the same, and how I view/treat others is pretty consistent. I don’t have mood swings either. There may be a possibility for comorbidity, but I personally don’t think so (but then again, I’m not a licensed psychologist or psychiatrist).

The scheduling idea is pretty great though, so thanks for suggesting that. I may try asking my partner for more affirmation, but I should probably be careful about asking too much of them. I can’t wait til covid ends so I can go back to therapy since I was looking for a new therapist right before the virus started.",t3_klce5h

gh8o9pu,t1_gh8mzok,"I’m sorry your exes have cheated on you, but what you’re saying has little to no relevance to my post and it just honestly makes you sound bitter. I’ve never called my fiancé anything like that and it’s honestly baffling that you think I have, since I made zero mention of speaking to him in that way. I highly suggest you do something more productive with your time, instead of making snarky comments and projecting your personal issues onto others. Again, very sorry about what you’ve been through, but you really don’t need to take it out on other people. It does nothing good",t3_klce5h
