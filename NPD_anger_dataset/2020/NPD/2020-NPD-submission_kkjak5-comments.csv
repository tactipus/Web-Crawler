gh4s6k8,t3_kkjak5,"Don't know if this idea will be welcomed or not, but throwing it out there--

&#x200B;

Felt exactly as you described, my entire life (40 years)-- spent the last few years going through a massive collapse, and almost losing absolutely everything (my wife, my successful small business, all of my ""friends"" from that business, a well-known podcast that I co-hosted, a great income-- you name it, I lost it)-- lost it all, except for my relationship with my daughter.

&#x200B;

In trying to ""slowly"" reverse the tides-- which, due to the collapse, ended up inducing major depressive disorder, and a severe noradenaline/dopamine deficiency-- I eventually went the route of a psychiatrist.  Bottom line, I thought therapy was stupid and pointless, as I ALWAYS knew more than the therapist did, about therapy itself.  (Doesn't mean I actually APPLIED said therapy; I ""knew it"", like we know empathy-- cognitively, but not by experience itself.)

&#x200B;

In dealing with the psychiatrist, after we got the severe depression somewhat controlled, I actually suggested that we try experimenting with a very mild anti-psychotic.  I didn't know enough about them, per se, and I was scared as hell that it was ""going to take my edge off""-- my mental edge-- make me stupid, slow, sluggish, etc.

&#x200B;

She agreed it might be a good idea, so we introduce Risperdone, very slow (just .5mg, once a day, to start-- I later asked to be taken up to .5mg, 2x/day; finally, .5mg, 3x/day, taking them about 4-5hrs apart).

&#x200B;

It ended up working very well for me-- took away that ""addiction to tension and feeling like my heart was about to explode"", which was all I knew, and thus, craved.  Allowed me actually start working, very slowly, on some mild mindfulness stuff (which, overall, I still suck at a LOT, and am trying to continue working on).  Allowed me to start actually meditating a bit, and actually GETTING something out of it.

&#x200B;

For the first time in my life probably, I started to feel ""just okay""-- with nothing else going on-- but, no emergencies, no thrills, no craziness, no hatred, no superiority, no ""need to be accomplishing something RIGHT NOW because otherwise, I'm average and mediocre and like everybody else"".

&#x200B;

If it's relevant, I'm a classic covert narc, but very driven-- and over time, became very accomplished in my field, got a lot of notoriety from it, and segued into a classic grandiose narc (my field was bodybuilding/training/fitness, so you can imagine how that one played out, as I rose up the ranks over the years).  To that end, I have no idea if the above will be helpful for you or not.  But a little medication here and there, might be able to slightly ""override and tame"" some of the ""constant background noise"" that is there for you, allow you to be a little more at peace with it, and find a way to start moving forward more efficiently.

&#x200B;

I wish you luck, my friend!

gh330vz,t1_gh2zp3a,"Iâ€™ve tried going to therapy for several months at a time with several different therapists, but I never really feel like they are able to see past my bs. 

I mean I know Iâ€™m supposed to be completely honest in therapy, but I find myself presenting like Iâ€™m totally normal and very personable. Basically, Iâ€™m lying to the therapist the whole time just to get a nice pat on the back.

But when I do try to put a little bit more of the truth out there, they already have such an inaccurate image of me in their heads, that they try to interpret what Iâ€™m saying as something not even relevant. And at that point Iâ€™m like wtf am I here? And I stop going.

Like Iâ€™m told I need to be fixed. Then I go to get fixed and I sabotage the whole thing every time. I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m even doing it intentionally, but it happens anyway. And of course I inevitably make things worse at home too, when Iâ€™m supposedly working on myself.

I donâ€™t feel like anything is going to change unless I get someone who can call me out on my bs and see through my lies. Which I feel like I would absolutely hate, but at the same time, I really feel like thatâ€™s what I need.",t3_kkjak5
gh6eh94,t1_gh5v4f7,"You're welcome!

So again, my situation all occurred in conjunction with going through a major narcissistic collapse. Â After 15+ years of being a competitive bodybuilder and running my own training business (and working CRAZY hours, 90hrs a week or more, most of the time), I just couldn't sustain it any more, and basically started having a mental breakdown (and physical breakdown). Â This started in 2016 (during my final year competing), and I fought it and fought it ""tried to fight through it"", up until mid 2018, at which point, I just couldn't fight it any longer.

I tried to continuing strength training, eating like a bodybuilding, and using steroids, through that point in 2018, but ""hated the process and lifestyle"" progressively more and more (as I blamed it as the cause of my increasing depression and anxiety)-- to the point where I started actively hoping I would get injured in the gym, just so I would have an excuse to stop living the lifestyle. Â However, I couldn't stop, because it was my identity-- literally, I had built this body, and built this business and reputation, all around this activity and lifestyle, so I couldn't fathom ""just not doing it any more"", even though I had really started to hate and resent it.

The working out started to become less and less with each passing week, and I kept digging deep to find some motivation. Â After many months of this, I finally resigned myself to say, ""Fuck it, you hate this-- it causes you nothing but anxiety and stress, you do nothing but compare yourself to other people while there, it doesn't feel good-- so just STOP DOING IT!"" Â And with that, I decided to just stop training completely. Â I had already relocated, and was now doing my coaching business from home, so I was pretty self-isolated (other than my wife and daughter), and ""didn't have to worry"" about anybody seeing me, and knowing the truth that I had walked away from training. Â (Again, at this point, I was suffering from bad depression and anxiety, but had no self-awareness yet of my NPD. Â The depression and anxiety were initially brought about from years of working the crazy schedule that I did, and the extreme lifestyle that didn't allow me to EVER sleep or recover etc., so we relocated in 2017, to work from home, thinking THAT would ""help me to feel better""-- and of course, as soon as I did so, I ""lost my audience"", and started going into full-blown collapse.)

So, once I gave up training, yes, I started developing a VERY different relationship with my body. Â I went through some stages of mourning-- after all, I had gone from a life-long fat kid, to a highly-ranked competitive bodybuilder, and spent 15 years, and a lot of effort, accomplishing that (which was REAL effort-- but driven by my weak self esteem). Â But over months and months, I started working towards ""not caring""-- after all, even though I lost something that mattered to me so much, at the same time, the pain from that was LESS than the pain from forcing myself to continue doing something I had started to hate so much-- so overall, it was okay, it was a ""win"" in my book, and I made peace with it. Â I stopped using all anabolic steroids, stopped eating healthy, stopped being physically active (and of course, in the process, swung extremely to the OTHER side, which isn't great either-- but openly embraced letting my physique fall apart, one of the cornerstones of my narcissism that I had built.)",t3_kkjak5
gh2xrom,t1_gh2u1ye,"I am emotionally stupid I admit.
I have another form of illness that exact opposite of NPD.

Its not healthy for me either.
I hate myself to the point I am depending on others.
I love others hang out with me I love helping people. 
If some one doesn't regulary talk to me. Or if I don't sit down with some one for  like 4 out of 7 days of week I get depressed. I love companionship.

More like two warriors together best friends lol
Its not healthy and also immature.
I have been manipulated recently by my Narc friend

Called him by phone after he ghosted me
Then he said talk to me after an hour
Spoke to him. Guesa what he made his new supply answer the phone and say the phone number has been sold. (I.e he made a joke that changed his number).

 I still have false dreams of him changing.",t3_kkjak5
gh2ygd3,t1_gh2u1ye,"Like you can't control your NPD I can't control my sick attatchemnt to people. Its not about validation. Its just I like to chase people life.

We used to do everything together including studying.


But now I understand the naracist was just mirroring me for his benifit.
He is enjoying it. And he is enjoying the ghosting. Feels like a super hero.

But speaking to you is beneficial.",t3_kkjak5
gh3snkq,t1_gh330vz,"Fuck dude hit me right where it hurts with this one. I am struggling with this myself a lot too.

I feel like I have convinced my therapist that I am a good person somehow. And that I am not a narcissist because at that time I think logically(good thing) but to be honest it doesn't carry over to the everyday life so it feels like lying.

Fuck this is so tough",t3_kkjak5
gh6eju7,t1_gh6eh94,"During the months when the major depression was at its worst (about 18 months, all together), I had a difficult time sleeping more than a few hours at a time. Â I was using a LOT of marijuana by that point, just to self-medicate and be somewhat calmed, and numb. Â Once self-isolated, I essentially turned into an extreme sex-addict with my wife, as a means of ""feeling SOMETHING"", and at least having SOME sense of supply (compared to all of the supply I was getting before). Â But of course, none of this filled the void, it just got worse.

Once I started actually taking psych meds-- and going to therapy -- yes, I started to develop a different relationship with my body. Â Though I think you might mean ""a different relationship with my EMOTIONS"". Â I STILL didn't know about my NPD, but I had basically lost EVERYTHING, and for the first time in decades, I just felt relatively powerless-- relatively ""useless"" and ""stupid"". Â I was ashamed to talk to any of my former friends and associates. Â But once we started with the psych meds, I was at least able to start ""mellowing out"".

Over several months, while isolating at home, I basically buried myself in simply reading books, something I hadn't done in years. Â It was relaxing and calming. Â I would sit outside, on our back porch, drinking lots of coffee throughout the day, and spending hours on reading. Â I aggressively began working on breathing techniques, and some meditation. Â The psych meds I was taking (Zoloft for depression, at 200mg/day; amitriptylene, for depression and anxiety, and to help with sleep; and Risperdol, at 1.5mg/day), like I said, felt like they contributed to helping allow me to settle down, slow down, take a breath (again, still smoking lots of pot at this time)-- coupled with coming off of anabolic steroids, coming off of stimulants (mostly just lots of caffeine), stopping working (manic hours)--

I basically ""forced myself to shut down""-- to ""shut down the motor, or the engine"", if that makes sense. Â I was in a position where I could afford to do so for a while, economically, since our business had done well enough that I had some personal savings, my own house, wife was still working to support us, etc.

My health insurance ran out last spring, and I was very stable, more stable than I've been in decades (no more steroids or weed, but still on psych meds)-- so I weaned off of psych meds, slowly, one by one, and seemed to do fine. Â However, once I started working in a new field, I could tell that I was starting to slip back into depression-- or more specifically, anhedonia-- and realized my ""old tendencies"" were starting to come into play. Â My 'addiction', is ""obsessive working and accomplishing"", but never feeling satisfied from it, just getting endless supply from it. Â And here, I was starting to go down that road again.",t3_kkjak5
gh2yqrm,t1_gh2xrom,[deleted],t3_kkjak5
gh6eknm,t1_gh6eju7,"So, I actually quit the job 2 weeks ago, am living off of some of the savings that I have, and ""going back to square one""-- no meds this time, but working on a lot of the tools I developed before while taking the meds (meditation, breathing techniques, going for daily walks, mindfulness techniques, working on building empathy, etc.).

I definitely am less inclined to that overdrive feeling of perfectionism, in part because I ""saw what a schmuck"" I really am. Â And I've been able to SUSTAIN being okay with that-- though I can see it's VERY easy to fall right back into it, as soon as I start engaging with the world again.

I've definitely learned to NOT ""push it to the limit""-- though again, that's my natural tendency, and it would be/could be very easy to go back to that again. Â Even right now, in trying to regroup, it's very easy to ""try to do it all at once""-- get back to exercising perfectly, eating perfectly, making friends again perfectly, etc., and ""overwhelming myself"" with ""getting through that list"" each day, almost in a an obsessive-compulsive manner. Â I literally am writing out a list each night of ""things I need to do the next day"", some as ""to-do"", some as ""goals"", and my only source of ""pride"" right now, is in working through that list. Â That said, I have to remind myself constantly, ""There's no need to work through the ENTIRE LIST, each day-- if I don't get to something, that's okay, I'm fine, I'll survive, I won't die"". Â I have to ""talk myself"" being ""okay"" with ""being a little normal and average"". Â Not sure if that will ever go away, or lighten up.

I'm still fairly self-isolation, so not in much of a position to help others. Â I've just started reaching back out to former clients and friends. Â I started by making a list of ""people who have mattered to me over the course of my life""-- and struggled to come up with 20 names at first (which included parents, exes, etc.)-- but over the course of a few weeks, it has slowly grown to a much larger list. Â One of my goals is to reach out to 1-2 people per day off that list, and try to talk to them (to work on redeveloping some social skills), and try to actually LISTEN to them, not make the entire convo about me, work on empathy, etc.

I'm more of a covert narc by nature, and my whole life, have had a big chip on my shoulder-- everybody is stupid, the world sucks, etc. Â The last few years, THAT has definitely changed a LOT-- as I have tried to find peace and understanding with other people, connection to the world at large. Â The fact is, I AM highly above average intellect-- BUT, coming to terms with the fact of ""so the fuck what?-- that doesn't mean SHIT-- and it doesn't entitle you to hate people, to look down on people, to use people, to get angry and frustrated with people,"" etc. Â THAT is the ""harder part"". Â But yes, I feel I have gotten to that point, in a fairly enduring way.

I try to be open about my NPD with people-- especially former friends and clients, those I have hurt or used in some way. Â BUT, I try to do it, WITHOUT being obsessive about the NPD, and turning the entire conversation INTO a conversation about ""my disorder and what's wrong/unique about me""-- which would simply be lapsing back into the NPD, lol. Â I spent a few years trying to learn about it, obsessively, and it's easy to start dumping on people, and turning it into a lecture about your disorder-- which just defeats the point of talking to other people in the FIRST place.

That said, most people have been very receptive, and understand it right away, and aren't surprised-- nor are they offended-- and have simply ""been okay"" with it. Â It's been HARD to admit to others that ""I'm fucked up in the head"", and be okay with it-- but the more I do it, and the more I see that I'm not rejected FOR it, the easier it gets.

Yes, I was the ""dumps cortisol and adrenaline in my veins every second"" person, for decades and decades. Â I USED that, to do very well in college-- then crashed-- then do very well for 15 years building my own business and competing-- then MEGA crashed, as it simply wasn't sustainable any longer. Â I would literally go every-other-night with sleeping, for years, while building the business-- that's how manically I approached it. Â But it finally caught up to me, and took its toll.

The ""just being okay"" part-- yeah, that's the trickiest part, because when we're fucked up and we KNOW it, we WANT that ""being okay part"", but we also DON'T want it, as it SUCKS-- it means ""the end of our identity, the end of LIFE"". Â I get it, 100%.

I can't promise it will be all roses. Â Again, the only thing that COMPELLED me to ""just fucking GO for it"", was the fact that 1) I was raised in a super abusive household, 2) I always vowed ""if you ever have children, you will be a GOOD father"", 3) I've been compelled to perfection in so many things, my entire life, 4) I had a daughter, and slowly started seeing I was NOT treating her well, and was starting to repeat the mistakes of my father.

If I didn't have a kid to motivate me to come to terms with being self-aware, I likely would have never taken any of the steps that I did. Â But I basically go to the point of ""being willing to literally die""-- being willing to literally trade my life-- in order to ensure my daughter's well-being. Â I would have rather killed myself, than fuck her up, like I was fucked up.

With that, working on killing my ego, became the only option.

And it's not like ""it WORKED!"". Â It's not a simply process, and I'm not ""cured"". Â I thought I was, when I weaned off all psych meds and eased back into working again-- only to see I was starting to walk the same-old obsessive paths, that my entire self-worth was defined by ""accomplishing stuff with career"", etc. Â 

Right now? Â I'm sitting at home, spending a lot of time each day meditating-- and reading books on ""building an AUTHENTIC and STABLE"" sense of self""-- reading books on emotional maturity-- and actually forcing myself to do the exercises, forcing myself to ""do the work"". Â Will start back up in therapy, and might start back on Risperdol, as soon as I'm working again, and have health insurance. Â I figure both can only help the process.

Again, that is a TON of detail, most of which I'm sure you didn't want, lol, but might help to give some context and perspective.

I seriously hope you can get some of the help that you need. Â Don't be scared, or try not to be. Â There IS life on the other side, and while it might be empty, and bland, for a while, it's also a chance to slowly figure out what you REALLY care about, what REALLY matters, instead of just faking through it, for life, and living in/accepting constant discomfort as the norm. Â The first time I actually ate a meal ""mindfully"", and realized-- ""Holy shit, I can CAN find joy in JUST CHEWING FOOD, and it's not a race to finish the food""-- was pretty bizarre and eye opening.

Being ""normal"" isn't a death sentence. Â And remember, you'll never be fully normal ANYWAYS, due to your condition-- you have TOOLS that will help you cope with reality, help make you stand out no matter what, etc.-- you just need to learn how to ACTUALLY control them, rather than be controlled BY them.

Best advice I can give.

Keep me posted on your progress-- and Happy New Year's!

gh7gf7w,t1_gh6qlwz,"Thanks for the insightful response!  And I just realized how ""diarrhea at the mouth"" my last response was-- I've been pretty isolated for a few years now, so just starting to ""relearn how to communicate"", and I guess I had a lot more to say (context and whatnot), than I realized!

Having a kid has been a challenge, for sure; but again, without her, I really don't think I would have ever gotten to stage of actually realizing the problem lies in ME, and not the world.  At least you already have that self-awareness going for you, which is potentially something to build off of, if you choose to.

Beyond that, the only real ""words of wisdom"" I can impart:

You have to keep coming back to the idea that ""that part of you"", that you ""can't give up"", ISN'T REALLY YOU-- it's a ""FAKE you""-- it's a narrative that you created, as a defense mechanism, because there IS NO REAL YOU-- or at least the ""real you"" that IS there, is likely very underdeveloped, fragile, and empty.

So the question is, Where do you go from there?

That is what I'm in the process of trying to figure out NOT-- once you really ""embrace rejecting the false self"", what the fuck is left?

Seems, in the beginning, NOT MUCH.  I slipped into a state of anhedonia, where pretty much nothing mattered-- I didn't feel depression, I just didn't feel ANYTHING, other than the cognitive glimmer of the love for my daughter.

So it seems like it's time to ""go back to the drawing board"", to try to see if it's actually possible to build a legitimate true and stable sense of self, even though I'm older.  The very thought of it seemed like a crazy uphill battle at first, so I'm just trying to do little things, one day at a time.

I make lists for myself, like:

1) what do I ACTUALLY enjoying doing with my time (especially things that do NOT require other people, so there's no possibility of mirroring or preying on supply).  For me, the list is pretty short, but slowly becoming longer-- reading, playing the drums, going on walks, etc.

2) then, trying to DO those things, regularly, and trying to be ""in the moment and mindful"" while doing them, rather than using them as a stepping stone to ""what is next""-- the next accomplishment, achievement, fantasy, ""hit of supply"".

3) doing simple stuff like ""self care"" that I easily neglect-- eating regular meals throughout the day; making sure they are healthy foods, for the most part; brushing my teeth daily; coming up with a short list of chores around the house and FORCING myself to do them, even when I don't feel like it.

And so forth.

Also working on slowly reintroducing relationships so I'm not so isolated-- making a list of people who have actually mattered to me throughout my life; seeing who on that list I have NOT abused or victimized; reaching out to them, initiating a legitimate conversation with them, and trying hard to NOT make it ""all about me""; etc.

I don't know if any of that helps, again.  But I hope that it does.

Just remember, everything that you are feeling, struggling with, stressing about-- it's ALL a defense mechanism.  In other words-- ""it doesn't HAVE to be that way"".  There IS a possibility of something else-- but feeling it, keeping it in mind, embracing it consistently, is hard as hell, as that's how we're literally wired.

Absolutely, I wish you new beginnings moving forward, and send love and kindness your way.  Have a great New Year's yourself!
