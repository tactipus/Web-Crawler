gghqr82,t3_kgrm2p,"Being called dangerous isn't an insult, it's a statement about something that is (arguably) factual.

The term narcissist has not been an insult since Freud wrote his paper 'On Narcissism' in 1914. It's only in the past 20 years or so that it's been used as an epithet.

Narcissism is also a highly unusual illness in that it tends to be other people in the narcissistic person's life who suffer the most rather than the narcissistic person. Actually it could be argued that it's kind of the point of the disorder, is to evacuate and evade pain and project it outwardly onto other people. This doesn't apply as much to vulnerable narcissism though if these people could be successful in being grandiose they'd prefer that to experiencing their pain and finding ways to deal with it themselves.

NPD is effectively a disorder of the ability to take responsibility for oneself and find ways to process trauma that go beyond blaming everyone else for one's difficulties. Parents of people who grow up to have NPD are often horribly abusive, and narcissism can be a necessary defense against that, but it doesn't mean that the NPD'd person should forever evade bearing that pain and fleeing from it, instead dumping it onto other people or blaming their parents wholly and forever. The only way out of this is to accept responsibility, not for the abuse that was suffered, but rather responsibility for working through those painful affects and moving past them. This is an integral step in bringing together the splits between good and bad experience that were necessary to protect against even more extreme fragmentation of the self as in schizophrenia. The splitting that is part of NPD and preserves some degree of integration of the self is entirely dependent on projection of bad out into others, which makes it an ultimately highly unstable organization of personality. It's thus better for both the NPD'd person and their significant others that they let go of this pathological defense.

It should be recognized that people with NPD do suffer, are mentally ill, and so on. But this doesn't mean that they don't also ruin other people's lives in ways that seem to be uniquely destructive, and uniquely unbalanced in that they tend to at least, to outward appearances, not be suffering very much themselves in these situations. And that picture isn't entirely inaccurate, no matter how true it is that the narcissist carries an abundance of unconscious guilt and suffers in ways that they refuse to feel or think about.",t3_kgrm2p

I think it's acceptable to say narcissists are dangerous, if you mean it factually. Same way angry young men are dangerous.

gghtxhm,t3_kgrm2p,"I'm in my graduate program right now for clinical psychology, because... there are fundamental changes that need to happen the psychiatric/mental health communities that I don't believe we will see in a while.

 Although we are making some progress with destigmatizing certain personality disorders, such as borderline personality disorder, things like narcissistic personality disorder and antisocial personality disorder remain some of the most stigmatized mental illnesses that exist. 

It's extremely hard for patients to get treatment without being scrutinized or shunned if a psychiatrist (if they would even be willing to work with them) It's just uncomfortable in general. We literally used to be referred to as sociopaths until 2014, NPD (or any personality disorder diagnosis, for that matter) can carry some negative weight on a person's life. Mental Health Care is just not something that can accommodate us right now.. Society definitely does not, either

Until changes can happen to mental health care, we have to make places, like this, online... For people to have an alternative to therapy or seeing a psychiatrist . We have to make narcissism something that is commonplace to discuss, NPD's have to do their part to break past their fears of societal stigmatization and speak out as well. (That's why I made r/NPD_Memes.  Even though some misinterpreted as shitposting, memrs really help to normalize these things... Just look how many people are apart of the borderline meme community)

| will do whatever | can to end the stigmatization, but until then, these spaces online, these kinds of conversations, & providing positive advice to encourage all of our slow, incremental self-growth processes... These are the contributions that we have to make to the world, until the stigmatization slowly fades... It sucks that that will not happen today",t3_kgrm2p
ggira4g,t3_kgrm2p,"This whole thread reminds me of that meme with Gordon Ramsey consoling cluster A and cluster C personalities, but you know... ""you fucking donkey"" to cluster B personalities.

Cluster C personalities are usually the ones suffering from their disorders the most while others, at worst, just find them odd. Cluster A personalities can cause a lot of distress in the people around them just like cluster Bs. But the cluster A is frequently just so out of touch with reality that they get a pass.

Cluster Bs have one foot in reality and one foot out. The foot outside of reality resting in fantasies or paranoia. I think that demonizing a cluster B personality happens because someone thinks that if one foot rests in reality then they should be able to bring the other foot back to reality. Or if one foot rests in reality they should be able to comprehend the full extent of their behavior in reality. That's not how it works. No amount of shit talking or reasoning or wailing is gonna bring them fully to reality either. The cluster B legitimately needs to recognize the difference between reality and nonreality, recognize that reality is not going their way, recognize that having one foot in fantasy is detrimental, and then work on bringing it back to reality. None of that happens at the behest of someone else.

Should it continue to be demonized? I don't know. I know that I'll continue to tell people to leave their narc if it's abusive. But everyone should be telling anyone to leave an abuser. But it's also probably the best thing for the narc. Reality very likely has to stop going their way to get better.

Borderlines were demonized for decades but slowly got at least accepted. I think people realizing that borderlines were terrified of being alone struck a heart chord. Maybe narcs should do a campaign on how they're terrified of being harmed, abused, or criticized. Would that be manipulation or truth?",t3_kgrm2p
ggjwyqv,t3_kgrm2p,UGH THIS IS NOT ANYTHING LIKE 4CHAN OR FACEFUCK,t3_kgrm2p
ggkrut9,t1_gghqr82,"Being called dangerous only on the premise of having a disorder with no other evidence is unfair. Even if there is some evidence in the past, treatment and personal growth may have made such evidence obsolete, and we must allow for that to be true in order to provide those with NPD the opportunity to be allowed genuine dignity within a society that generally fears or loathes them.

Chronic alcoholism is a reasonable comparison. If a person had committed many foul deeds during a long period of alcohol consumption but has since ceased drinking (or drinks very little and only in the company of accountability partners), while they are still technically an alcoholic that may still be prone to destructive behaviour if intoxicated they have learned to manage the condition by means of healthy boundaries. While someone diagnosed with NPD isn't necessarily consuming a foreign substance that affects their behaviour, it appears that the ""drug"" which leads to a dramatically increased potential for destructive behaviour is generally found in the format of relationships that they form with others around them. Correct me if I'm wrong but narcissists aren't nearly as notorious for material harm as they are social harm, and that tends to occur to those with whom they share weak boundaries.

As for an undiagnosed narcissist's level of danger, I think the same could be said of many undiagnosed conditions with a propensity for rage, despair, manipulative/antisocial behaviour, and even paranoid delusions which cause intense fear that may lead to preemptive attacks against whomever agitates their condition.

Note that my opinion is predicated on the unprovable opinion that narcissists that are diagnosed or otherwise made apparent tend to be either cases of relative severity or revealed because of a specific (and sometimes isolated) catastrophic event which raised attention to their condition. You refer to it as a ""highly unusual illness"" but I am of the belief that those with moderate symptoms are not rare and merely go under the radar. We once believed that clinical depression was relatively rare and now see that the people around us who we considered to be merely bias toward negative or having low self-esteem are in fact expressing symptoms of their disorder. It's possible that we are now finding ourselves with a surplus of false presumption or improper diagnosis of clinical depression, but I've been persuaded by personal experience and study that it definitely more common than we had believed prior to the early 90's (not coincidentally when commercial drugs for depression became widely available, mind you, which perhaps exacerbated false positives as appears common when the pharmaceutical industry brings new items to market that treat issues of physical comfort and mental health).

I could be entirely unjustified in my position on the issue but I feel that narcissism is a boogeyman known for examples of its most acute dangers rather than the character and lifestyle of human beings who have the condition. Perhaps you can agree that neurotypical people who commit horrible deeds for any number of reasons (especially greed, lust, or substance abuse) tend to be incriminated individually, whereas narcissists appear to be incriminated collectively despite their individual differences or a lack of evidence that they would do what others with their condition have done other than their diagnosis.

I don't really know how long ""narcissist"" has been an insult within a vernacular but I believe it goes much further back than 20 years based on my memory (at least among educated communities, as the word is less likely to be found within a low level of vocabulary even today). In fact, 20+ years ago it was popularly understood only as an insult and not nearly as known for referring to a condition, at least based on my observation in my exposure to it at that time. Then again maybe it was just me that only knew it as an insult, and maybe I happened to learn it around the time of its rise to popularity!",t3_kgrm2p
ggi5fu5,t1_gghqm1s,"Antisocial personality disorder is , arguably, THE most stigmatized mental illness that does exist. You guys do have it a bit worse, and I feel as if it will take more time to end the stigma against aspd.

ggjh249,t1_ggj5r6h,damn right.,t3_kgrm2p
ggkuepo,t1_ggj5r6h,"Note that the following is all opinion based on my experience, I claim no special knowledge on the subject and I have not been officially diagnosed with any of the indicated disorders:

I suppose you're right about that, although I don't think the world is nearly as familiar with ASPD and BPD to the extent that they are eager to actively hate those with the condition unless they have been personally affected. The world openly hates narcissists even if they are completely unfamiliar with the clinical definition and have never met someone diagnosed with the condition. To my knowledge, BPD is only recently gaining recognition and although I vaguely recall that ASPD was sensationalised due to a film (Psycho?) it is more commonly misinterpreted as implying asocial behaviour due to how the word ""antisocial"" is used on its own. *Then again*, if we still consider ASPD as being practically synonymous with psychopathy and sociopathy then yes I believe that ASPD and NPD share similar levels of social public condemnation. At least historically, as I've observed that usage of either obsolete term has declined in popularity in recent years due to a greater recognition of mental illness as a clinical problem rather than indications of bad character (around the same time it became inappropriate/obsolete to refer to intellectual disabilities as retardation e.g. ""they're not stupid, they're ill""). The same cannot be said for NPD, which remains widely regarded as both a clinical problem *and* an indication of bad character, wherein if you are diagnosed as a narcissist then you are perhaps immediately condemned as a terrible person *maybe even by your clinician* (according to how popular it is for clinicians to openly berate narcissists on YouTube as more or less irredeemable monsters, which isn't a direct indication of probability in a clinical setting but I found very bizarre).

""Angry young men"" is a group whose dangerousness is contingent upon a temporary state. Narcissism is not a temporary state, and therefore I don't think the comparison is appropriate because I don't believe that the condition is *inherently* dangerous so much as it is a condition that is dangerous *in specific circumstances*.",t3_kgrm2p
ggiut5y,t1_gggmwxd,">because no one who treats people the way narcissists do is worthy of a sliver of respect.

There is no unified narcissistic experience.

To claim otherwise can be a grandiosity, splitting, or any number of other trauma responses.

NPDs are not born that way, and are created by other people with disorders - it exists on a spectrum you are not immune to this process either, autistic or not.

If there was a button you could press that would send everyone with NPD to Earth-2, pressing it would still not resolve your own issues.

ggkvtu3,t1_ggkuepo,"Well I take your point for BPD, but I still think ASPD is misunderstood as ""that guy is evil so he's a psychopath"" and that sounds very similar to ""That guy is an abuser so he is a narcissist"". 

I think you point to a key difference. While psychopath and ""crazy ex girlfriend"" might be hated in general, they're not always associated with the diagnosis like NPD seems to be. There is something uniquely shitty about ""victims of narcissists"" hate groups, when they definitely try to talk about the mental illness of narcissism and NPD and not just the insult. 

I think you are right - I'm amazed some of those YouTube clinicians keep their license. Where I am,  posting that filth in a newspaper say would have them without a license quick smart. 

Yeah you're right about the dangerous bit. My point was more to say that angry young men aren't really likely to cause you harm, but what danger they're capable of might lead you to avoid them slightly.

ggl5o7u,t1_ggkvtu3,"I accept that you may be right, especially given that you would know better than I do, but from my perspective most people simply don't know that ASPD is the modern term for psychopathy/sociopathy. The average person would more reliably associate ASPD with general antisocial behaviour, which is perhaps broad enough to leave room for humanity and assumptions that those affected by ASPD are not a threat. Narcissism appears to imply that a person only cares about themselves and will reliably exploit people, which leaves very little room for humanity and is an imminent threat. In fact it even appears that many people in this subreddit, even those with NPD, would agree. Which is paradoxical due to seeing many people with NPD appear to care about each other here. Or perhaps that's merely bait? ;)

I find it interesting that pedophilia (the desire, not the act) is very slowly being recognised by the general public as a mental illness that is eligible for treatment (humanised), whereas NPD is gradually being viewed by the general public as *innate and untreatable malevolence* (dehumanised). It's unlikely that any condition will compete with pedophilia for pariah status anytime soon because even without having committed an act they will be regarded as child rapists but at the same time we can observe that society continues to increase the sexualisation of minors via entertainment/social media while increasingly referring to despised public figures as narcissists. For example, everyone that hates Donald Trump appears convinced, without evidence based on a proper diagnosis in a clinical setting, that he is a genuine narcissist. This was primarily because a group of clinicians who hate Trump got together and suggested that it's true, which I think is highly unethical to do both because it is speculative and because it was used as a means to rationalise hatred and attribute evil to a political enemy on the basis of a personality disorder that affects ordinary people.",t3_kgrm2p
