ggklqs0,t3_kh9b51,"There's no such thing as closure really. You now know what you need to know. That is enough. You know he was abusive, and you know you don't want him in your life. Now you just need to heal. And that comes with time. But remember, every time you try to contact him, you reset your trauma recovery timer. This is something you have to go through to get out the other side. You cannot go around it. It will hurt like crazy at times, but you will learn from it, and be stronger on the other side, you'll reach a point where you wonder why you ever gave a fuck about him.",t3_kh9b51
ggjwzo9,t3_kh9b51,"You might get better answers from r/askNPD. r/NPD is a sub for people with NPD to support each other. 

Supposing your partner had NPD, it's likely you won't hear back from him. Most people move on after the end of a relationships and NPD makes moving on easier. 

It sounds like you are really suffering from this break up. There is something called positive psychology, where a psychologist is trained to help someone move forward and improve their lives, and not just address mental illness - a lot of people don't know that so they don't seek help for these normal issues. You could definitely really benefit from talking to a professional about the stress you're feeling.",t3_kh9b51
ggkcin8,t3_kh9b51,"Psychopath here, most likely he hasn't blocked you on all forms of communication because he is enjoying watching you suffer. The moment he gets bored with this he will either block you out completely or reach out for the sole purpose to play with you again. You will not get the closure you are looking for.",t3_kh9b51
ggk2zck,t3_kh9b51,He did you a favor. Accept you will not get the closure you seek from him. He is not capable of empathy.,t3_kh9b51
ggl7296,t3_kh9b51,"Can’t really understand why you would want to be in contact with someone who is abusive to you at any point? But i’m a narcissist and cut people off at the drop of a hat if they wrong me slightly so someone who was abusive to me would be much safer in hiding. 
Whatever your issues are they are so far removed from my issues/traits/disorder that I literally cannot fathom why you would even want to speak to that person. Maybe he knows how bad he is to you, knows you don’t have it in you to stay away from him so he’s doing you a favour? Maybe he was trying to push you away with the abuse but you were able to detach from him so he’s taken the opportunity to cut ties when he could. Either way he’s done the right thing and you are safer without him so please try to forget about him!!",t3_kh9b51
ggjx8dz,t3_kh9b51,What question are you looking to have answered?,t3_kh9b51
ggn5d4q,t3_kh9b51,"The information you had provided is insufficient for anyone to have even a remotely qualified opinion on the topic. You're just inviting people to wildly speculate about something that is deeply troubling to you in order to affirm suspicions and/or feel validated. It's not terrible, I just think you should be aware (if you weren't already).

I would *suggest* to you that *if* you think he *probably* believes that he has little or nothing to gain from further contact with you then it is *unlikely* that he will unless he has attachment issues. This is even more likely *if* he believes that contacting you will be unpleasant for him.

Mind you, after 8 years of being with someone there can be a lot of practical reasons why someone will find a reason to contact a former partner within the first year or two of a breakup. This could be due to material reasons (personal property, finances, etc) or informational/social purposes (you have contact details of someone he wishes to contact or mutual friends). But again, if you believe that he does not have attachment issues and has nothing to gain from you then you'd need to come up with some reason why he would contact you again if you want anyone to offer any meaningful speculation.

And finally, it's entirely unclear *what* you are begging and pleading to him *for*, along with what answer you want him to give you. These are things that you mention in your post but ascribe no meaning to whatsoever. It makes it sound like you have attachment/codependency issues and yet you make it clear you won't take him back. So why do you want to regain contact? What does closure look like to you? Did you expect to remain friends after an abusive relationship, or do you just require some meaningful form of apology and/or admission of guilt relating to abuse?",t3_kh9b51
ggkfw9a,t3_kh9b51,"Ahhhh, The ballad of the borderline and the narcissist",t3_kh9b51
ggzpl3b,t3_kh9b51,"May I suggest that you look up Trauma Bonding. The intermittent breadcrumbs that are given to those who have suffered from narcissistic injury, causes one of the most addictive (think heroin) psychological bonds known. It goes beyond obsessing about the person and the pain is as real as physical abuse and the steps to free oneself is similar to any addiction. Your adhd/ ptsd aggravates this. I don't agree that you are giving insufficient or vague information as my brain works like yours and neither nons nor narcs will get it. Even if you got an explanation, such as he is staying away from you and he believes that you are the abuser. Ow. And narratives whether perceived or real don't help. Either you guys are consistently able to resolve problems via polite conversation or you are not. Addiction to anything steals the focus from the only thing that can help you and that is to heal this very deep wound you carry within. Find something that works for you and try several approaches. I have found that staying single gives me far less to worry about and my suffering greatly diminished. We are many out there that have lost it all due to our bad choices.",t3_kh9b51

gglhv96,t1_ggk2zck,Ending a relationship in a cruel way is not “a favor” - even tho it’s better they are not together. Abandoning someone and leaving them tortured with questions is not a favor. The pain OP is in is not a favor.,t3_kh9b51
ggkfy5f,t1_ggk2zck,Having a compromised or complete lack of empathy is actually not necessary symptomology to qualify for the criterion to be clinically narcissistic. You only need five of nine symptoms LOL,t3_kh9b51
ggkfzcj,t1_ggk2zck,Don’t speak of things when we aren’t even completely sure how many different mannerisms in which this illness can even manifest ok?,t3_kh9b51
ggjxfgy,t1_ggjx8dz,"If he’s likely to eventually reach out or have I probably injured him too badly by confronting his abuse to me? I know none of us could possibly be certain, but I figured I might as well at least ask.",t3_kh9b51
ggki6lv,t1_ggkfw9a,"Except I’ve seen several doctors, my therapist, and psychiatrist for extensive periods of time and have never received that diagnosis..not all borderlines are with narcissists and vice versa, although it can be common. Although it shouldn’t matter the diagnoses I’ve received are major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety, ADHD, and PTSD.",t3_kh9b51
gglqoi4,t1_ggkib2h,"This is the truth.  And the more you “act crazy” the more his ego gets a boost and the more he affirms his decision that you are worthless. It’s like, “I treat her like shit, and she stays wanting more. I don’t want anyone this stupid”. 

Get some help to grow. Love doesn’t hurt.",t3_kh9b51
ggqwtkm,t1_gglhv96,"With a relationship this toxic I don’t think there can be any reasonable expectations of closure. This person isnt going to be able to answer these questions adequately without a lot of self-work (and for someone capable of damage like this that would take many years). Prolonging contact would be prolonging pain for all parties. A ‘clean break’ often heals better than a messy one too.

Things that objectively bad can still be viewed as a favour in other lights. My mother became an alcoholic in my preteen years. Perversely, this was quite the favour for me as the verbal abuse reduced and her intrusiveness diminished (which meant I still got to meet some normal developmental milestones at that time). She still doesn’t know it, but I am so very grateful she became an addict then.

There are still good things to find, even in crappy things. It’s a very grey world out there.",t3_kh9b51
ggjy7ry,t1_ggjxfgy,"It's possible - he might eventually drop you a line if it catches his interest on a particular day, but understand that it wouldn't be the same context as before - out of sight  can really be out of mind for us.

I've spoken to NPD exes post-breakup and we have never, not once discussed why the relationship imploded. I think we were both more interested in proving that we could be civil and we were getting along just fine.

You're better off chasing the closure that comes with 'I accept what happened and no longer need his validation' over 'I need to hear you say it' imo - get a professional opinion though.",t3_kh9b51
ggn043p,t1_ggki6lv,"Lol I don't know anything about them, nor do I honestly care to. Comes off as too whiny & smells a little bit like lack of self-awareness. 

Low quality, super generalized passing thought I had in reading this.",t3_kh9b51
ggr32mi,t1_ggqwtkm,"It is a gray world. There might not be full closure, but there might be a lot more closure than ghosting provides - which is zero - if he handled it differently. 

I'm glad for you that you're so good at recognizing the good parts of difficult situations. But I think it is unkind, even though you mean it to be encouraging, to tell someone in real agony that what happened to them was a favor. 

I got ghosted by someone I was very close with, right before the pandemic. It would have been magnitudes easier if they had just *told me* they were ending it and why. Complete 100% closure? Probably not. Would it still have been a loss? Of course. But it would've spared me a lot of unnecessary pain. I've lost other close relationships, but have not struggled the same way the ghosting made me struggle. It was not a favor, and neither is the way OP's relationship ended.",t3_kh9b51
ggrgn2x,t1_ggr32mi,">if he had handled it differently.

We don’t know much about this person, other than that he is described as abusive and dangerous. I don‘t know how much experience you have with people like this, but the one consistent thing about such people is that if you hold any expectation of them you will be either be hurt, disappointed or harmed. Normal social expectations don’t apply because these people (abusive people) can’t comply. If they could, they wouldn’t be abusive.

Yes, things could have gone different. Maybe closure, maybe violence, maybe coercion, or manipulation, or reconciliation. We don’t know. It didn‘t happen and at this point probably won’t. Focusing on what could have been the best outcome of a situation that never occurred seems to me to be flying pretty close to magical thinking, which is something that does happen with pain and loss, and it really does suck.

The OP is going to have to find a way to make peace with this for themselves. All I was trying to say is there is another angle to look at this from, perhaps a more realistic angle considering the qualities of the person in question. There are a whole spectrum of ways to look at and feel about trauma and loss, and it can be helpful to know there could be some positive way to look at hurtful events, even if one is not in a place to feel that just yet.

Also, I’m sorry you have personal experience with the pain of being ghosted. I can’t say I have a similar personal experience of it, but I can imagine that it would be a confusing and painful experience and it does make sense that thinking of how it could have gone differently could provide comfort. I hope you find your peace with what happened to you too.",t3_kh9b51
