gheiub3,t3_kmgv32,"Hi! First off, I'm really proud of you for wanting to try to become more honest, or completely honest. The first big step is to, from this point, don't add to the list of lies. You can be honest today. At the end of the day, ask yourself, have I told any lies? Why did I tell them? Can I be better tomorrow? The answer is yes. It'll take time, and practice.

The lies that you have already told are so much trickier, but it can be accomplished. I'm going to share an r/NPD post from a couple months ago that greatly affected both me and my partner (my partner is NPD, and this is his biggest hurdle as well - lies told and how he struggles with not automatically lying). 

And finally I'm going to ask my partner to weigh in, because he has personal experience with this struggle. He is quite busy at the moment, but I know that when he gets a chance, he'll offer his wisdom and experience.

So, let me grab the link to that post and send him a message. Hey, @OP, good luck to you. And don't give up, no matter how hard it seems. We, here, get it, and we are rooting for you.",t3_kmgv32
ghh099u,t3_kmgv32,"Once I started being more honest I had much less to say, which made me also realize that I often speak just to hear the sound of my own voice. It really is much more peaceful when you speak only when necessary and when you have something good to contribute. 

Try pausing for a few seconds before randomly saying something/responding. If you’re afraid of someone knowing your truth, don’t explicitly lie. Just be vague enough where you’re still honest, but not opening up before you’re ready.",t3_kmgv32
ghflh51,t3_kmgv32,"Hey, have you ever tried getting a mind analysis summary and action plan to help with building an authentic personality?",t3_kmgv32
ghek3l8,t3_kmgv32,Thank you so much you’re clearly a very empathetic person. That is such good advice about doing it by day and thank you I’d love to read the post and what your partner has to say about their experience,t3_kmgv32
ghfljl1,t3_kmgv32,"It's hard.

There's no other way to say it.  It's hard.  You spend your life with dishonesty as not just a viable option in all of your interactions, but the default option...to make that fundamental change in your life is beyond difficult.  I know.  I'm doing it right now. I do it every single day. I do it almost every time I open my mouth.  

I want to lie. My first impulse will be to lie. Not just to cover up something unattractive about myself.  Not just to hide something I'm ashamed of. But in everything. First impulse is to lie.  You have to be conscious of every time you open your mouth and you have to be willing to stop and step back and say the words ""that was a lie, I apologize.""

It's hard.

It has to be worth it to you.  You can do it for another person, but that's not necessarily going to last.  It will all go out the window the first time you feel slighted or offended by that person.  That's a narc thing, and it makes it doubly hard.  You have to want to do it for yourself.  You have to WANT to be better.  Better partner, better friend, better human being in general.

I have never been trustworthy.  I'm almost 40 years old and I have never been someone that anyone could trust.  Now I want to be.  I want to be that person for once in my fucking life, and it makes looking back at all the lies told up til now so hard to look at and so shameful.  It helps, to be humbled by those lies.  It means that I know the difference and it means, most importantly, that the difference matters to me.

As for expunging the lies you've already held on to for so long...my friend, that's all in your corner.  I can't tell you what a relief it is to just sit down with the person that you've lied to and give them everything.  I can't tell you because I was never able to do it.  They had to be dragged from me, painfully and catastrophically, one by one screaming into the daylight.  I never truly sat down and gave everything up.

What I CAN tell you is that I wish that I had.  Because not doing it has damaged any credibility I COULD have had.  Maybe I'm all out of lies, but since I wasn't able to do it willingly...how can I be trusted?  It would have been so much easier, so much BETTER, to have truly given everything up out of my own volition.  Instead, I have to walk an even longer and more painful road to get to trustworthiness.

If you want to be an honest person, then be that person.  Emptying yourself of every lie is the better way.  I can tell you that because I can see how it would have gone if I HAD done that, and I'm filled with regret that I didn't.

Good luck, my friend.  Maybe it seems like the most painful option possible, unloading everything, but I can assure you that it is the least.",t3_kmgv32
ghfklue,t3_kmgv32,"Glad you’re self-reflecting, therapy is probably the best option to get to the root cause of why you feel inclined to embellish or lie. I tend to omit details or stretch the truth when I feel like it will disappoint someone else, but I’m working on reminding myself that people would rather hear the truth from you before it blows up because it will come out eventually.",t3_kmgv32
ghfilqi,t3_kmgv32,I’m forced to be honest most of the time.  Otherwise how would I get away with lying when I need to?,t3_kmgv32
gheyfw7,t3_kmgv32,There really isn't a good reason not to do whatever you want.,t3_kmgv32

ghlinaf,t1_ghh099u,"You were just like how I am....and it drains my wife. She hates when I ""word salad."" I don't talk just to hear my own voice, but I think I speak many useless words because of shame, impulsiveness, anxiety, and a childish mentality created by my narc mom.

My advice (from my experiences with my wife, so not dismissing Jazz's advice to be vague enough where you're still honest) is to practice being as honest as possible. Don't be vague, be truthful to yourself, and tell the hard truth (in my case, that I don't care enough about my wife to do things that will help her). This in turn will help you be more honest with each passing day and hopefully 100% honest someday.",t3_kmgv32
ghfm77s,t1_ghflh51,I have no idea what any of those things are but they sound very helpful. What are they and where should I start?,t3_kmgv32
ghfnh3c,t1_ghfljl1,Thank your for your honesty I know I need to change before it’s too late and I’m glad I’m still young and my mind is still forming. Can I ask where or who you began to tell the truth to? I started telling my parents how selfish I am today with mixed results but I’ve hurt other people so much more with my lies than them so it was kind of an easy start,t3_kmgv32
ghflmsp,t1_ghfklue,Thank you for your honesty. that is also one of my problems. I exaggerate a lot and also omit large portions of my life to certain people and now I can’t keep up with my different stories and can’t remember my lies because they’re so old but they have affected people so much that they have made serious changes to their life just because of some story I made up years ago,t3_kmgv32
ghfjwdh,t1_ghfilqi,I’ve somehow managed to get away with lies. Or maybe I haven’t but no ones told me they know I’m lying. I normally just come out with a bigger lie or make them think I didn’t say what I did,t3_kmgv32
ghez0og,t1_gheyfw7,Im sorry I don’t really understand what you mean?,t3_kmgv32
ghels1y,t1_ghejjmd,thank you that was very powerful to read. My exes are definitely the people I’ve hurt the most that’s probably where most of my guilt comes from or maybe it’s shame I’m only just realising I don’t know really know what emotions I’ve felt,t3_kmgv32
ghek8br,t1_ghejjmd,Thank you I’ll read it now!,t3_kmgv32
ghh9ysd,t1_ghfnh3c,It's a start. I'm in a similar space as you. 39 though. it's tough but it's possible.,t3_kmgv32
ghp2css,t1_ghfjwdh,"You never get away with lying, even if nobody ever finds out. Lies are heavy emotional baggageand you carry with you forever. Also, the longer you hold onto it, the heavier it becomes, as situations appear where you have to construct new lies to support the original.",t3_kmgv32
ghh9fww,t1_ghez0og,He (or she) means they probably have NPD and don't understand empathy or the rewards for being able to overcome NPD. You are beginning to. Keep going.,t3_kmgv32
