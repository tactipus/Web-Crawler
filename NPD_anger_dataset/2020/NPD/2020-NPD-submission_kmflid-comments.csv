gheg3rr,t3_kmflid,"I am diagnosed with schizoaffective and OCD but I do have narcissistic traits (as a coping mechanism). But they said I don't have a full personality disorder. So yeah I can be hypomanic with narcissistic traits, but that's a symptom of it (grandiose delusions).",t3_kmflid

gheiqav,t3_kmflid,One more question..how do you cope with it?,t3_kmflid
ghg0arw,t1_gheiqav,That’s not how that works. Mania can produce grandiosity but that doesn’t mean narcissists can be hypomanic or manic. They have to be bipolar or schizoaffective for that.,t3_kmflid
