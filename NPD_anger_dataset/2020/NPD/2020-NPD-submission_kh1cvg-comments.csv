gginjyc,t3_kh1cvg,Relief! When me and my ex wife broke up she said I had NPD. She was a psychiatrist. I really toook it to heart. I realized that yes I am extremely selfish and I am only focused on what I need. I am making a conscious effort to change that,t3_kh1cvg
ggj7fml,t3_kh1cvg,"the way you talk about relationships with people who have npd is *insane.* if they were unhealthy for you, im glad you broke contact, but people with npd *are still people,* and *will be hurt* if someone they consider close to them suddenly shuts them out. i dont know how to explain to you that narcissists are people who have been *seriously hurt*, and you should *care.*

edit: typo.",t3_kh1cvg
ggiwy26,t3_kh1cvg,"Depends on the type of NPD and how self-aware they are.

To generalise wildly without evidence:

Grandiose: Fight or flight

Covert: ""oh shit I'm losing another one I need to double down oh my god it's not helping time to hide""

Grandiose in treatment: Move on politely

Covert in treatment: ""I can understand that reaction, I shouldn't be overly invested in winning everyone over, good fences make good neighbours and I need to figure out where the line is so I don't end up martyring myself if they take this too far""",t3_kh1cvg
ggjkrjk,t3_kh1cvg,"The way you say “exposed” makes me feel as though you weren’t changing the relationship dynamic in a way that was ultimately well-intentioned. 

They were sad, most likely. Depending on the narcissist, they either acted firstly as though they could not care less, or were deeply upset at the fact that their supply had been cut off.

The deeper sadness sets in later. You know, the actual sadness that one feels after losing a loved one. They then realize they cannot sustain relationships. The feeling of being chronically alone is not a good one. So they get on the hunt for their next supplier almost immediately.

Don’t think they’re cold blooded. They hold and protect very, very hurt children on the inside. That child feels it all, but the adult on the exterior injects themselves with the narcissist feelings-be-gone. This usually leads to chemical dependency and addiction.

When this happens, a narcissist acts as a narcissist would. Ignore, repress, hunt.",t3_kh1cvg
ggn4k46,t3_kh1cvg,"Not going to lie I think the OP is a narcissist in denial. This post and their comments are too funny. They think they’re so intelligent and superior to the “narcs” they’ve “exposed” 
Most narcs have been abused by narcs, narc parent etc, hello join the club. The reactive reaction you speak of is narcissistic behaviour. You switch on people at the drop of a hat-narc",t3_kh1cvg
ggikv59,t3_kh1cvg,"""Exposed""

What do you mean by that?

Exposed for what, being a person with NPD? If you do this, you're not a good person.
You expose someone who is doing wrong, not all NPD are manipulative or scheming, you're just being an antagonist.",t3_kh1cvg
ggqb3uk,t3_kh1cvg,"But...how? I get co-pendants depend on the addiction-like high we give them bcs they never know when they're in our good graces.... But how are we with NPD a doormat if we (stupidly) think we are superior than our partner?
I know I am the biggest doormat but only w people who hold more power than me (like my boss or doctors). But w my partners... when I have a NPD episode I treat them w such contempt...I'm never a doormat w partners I (stupidly) consider 'inferior' even though they are clearly more mentally /emotionally healthy than I am... Geez I hate that this is me...",t3_kh1cvg
ggj1sbq,t1_gginjyc,"Wow, unethical, but wow. In a horrible way, you are very lucky for that.",t3_kh1cvg
ggka5ay,t1_ggj7fml,True- it’s so heartbreaking that everything I read says run and there is no hope,t3_kh1cvg
ggjdxc3,t1_ggj7fml,"I’ve been abused too many times by narcs in my life. It’s like when you’ve been bitten by a dog while asleep and now you have a reactive reaction to dogs. You have the memories of how those people trampled your well-being and knowingly violated your rights. So I have a right not to forgive. I can show respect to an NPD in order prevent problems, but I’ll keep that person on an arms length for my emotional well-being. I’ve been through too much anguish already and no more.",t3_kh1cvg
ggixmjl,t1_ggiwy26,"Great answer, thank you.

Can you clarify “I need to figure out where the line is so I don’t end up martyring myself if they take things too far” on the last part about Coverts in treatment?",t3_kh1cvg
ggimep1,t1_ggikv59,"I was unclear in the post, my apologies. I’ll give an example of what I mean.

Say I’m sitting with someone I’ve known for a while, a family member or coworker, and held in high regard, then suddenly realized “This person is a narcissist” and switched my attitude from friendly to neutral/distant (stopped giving supply).

What goes on in the NPD’s mind when they notice that switch in me? How do they think and perceive that situation?

This exact scenario has happened to a family member and a coworker. They either got extremely socially anxious and avoidant or extremely predatory-angry and sociopathic.",t3_kh1cvg
ggjhuhi,t1_ggj1sbq,Why?,t3_kh1cvg
ggkb8d2,t1_ggka5ay,"theres always hope. sometimes it truly is safer and better to cut and run, but if it is, its because he person themself is unhealthy, not because npd is a life sentence. im happily married, 5 years deep into my relationship, for example.",t3_kh1cvg
ggjf4vm,t1_ggjdxc3,"then why the hell, respectfully, are you posting in a **support forum** for npds? if youve been hurt so much you have an aversion, why are you posting in a forum full of the very people who you flinch at? who is it going to help?",t3_kh1cvg
ggn2ton,t1_ggjdxc3,Have you ever looked at your self and wondered if you are a narcissist?,t3_kh1cvg
ggiyxcp,t1_ggixmjl,"Speaking personally, it's easy when you view yourself as fundamentally flawed to take personal responsibility far and beyond the actual outcomes of one's actions.

You can have NPD and still be treated unprofessionally / unfairly, and rolling over with the oh-so-validating phrase ""I deserve this"" instead of standing up for yourself is still not a healthy response - it's just unhealthy in a different direction.

Maybe you've actually wronged them and they're playing tit-for-tat, and that's one thing.

Maybe they've just clocked your personality before you've had a chance to do anything wrong, and are having a initial emotional reaction themselves, and that's another.

If they make it their mission to treat you less-than far and beyond a proportionate response and over an extended period of time, tolerating this because ""I deserve it"" is just a grandiose martyrdom response, and not helpful for either party.

And yes, literally refusing to give someone ""supply"" under all circumstances is a touch unnatural - in healthy human interactions attention ebbs and flows naturally and withholding it simply because another party is addicted to it isn't a healthy response either.

Golden middle and all that, in short.",t3_kh1cvg
ggiqd6v,t1_ggimep1,"When that happens after a previous relationship has been established I know the person has realised what is off in our interactions and they are now choosing to protect themselves. It doesn‘t bother me in the slightest, as I’ve usually been hand holding these people due to their lack of insight into themselves. Seeing me for what I am is a step towards seeing themselves, which I‘m always on board for. Also, I tire of people and it looks much better if they move away from me than me from them.

Sorry, probably not the answer you wanted to hear.",t3_kh1cvg
ggji03p,t1_ggimep1,"So you just switch your attitude and distance yourself from the person without explanation? I don't anyone would react well to that, personality disorder or not. I'd initially assume you are having a bad day or some personal issue you need to sort out and give you space. But if the change persists and/or I notice you act weird around me in particular, I'd confront you about it. So to answer your question, the thought on my mind is ""wtf is their problem?""",t3_kh1cvg
gginjt6,t1_ggimep1,"Ok, I see what you mean. 
I cant say its happened to me, everyone who knows my diagnosis I've told, otherwise they probably wouldnt have guessed. 
My narcissism isnt really overt, I feel I'm just confident enough in some of my abilities, but i was diagnosed as NPD.

I'll be honest, I think I was misdiagnosed, because I think they read too much into me saying ""I think I'm smarter than most people out there"".
That's been proven time and again, but do I think I'm infallible or that my knowledge is complete? Of course not.
But yeah, I know I can be mildly manipulative, I know what strings to pull in social situations, even amongst random people, but I'm not insidious with it, I think deep down we all try to get what we want.

So I dont know how to answer your question as it's not a situation I've encountered. 
Sorry",t3_kh1cvg
ggn3pyc,t1_ggimep1,"For me if someone did this I wouldn’t feel exposed i’d just think what is wrong with that person why are they such a weirdo are they a psycho, imagine being so inconsistent disingenuous and disloyal so as to turn on someone and then i’d probably forget they existed. If it was someone I had to see daily or often they’d notice a change and they’d know I didn’t like them anymore but at no point would I think I was in the wrong I would just wonder what their problem was and hope they don’t irritate me with their strange behaviour. If it was really irritating me i’d probably call it out and find a way of bringing it up, i’d also probably do that in an environment where they felt vulnerable or were made to feel stupid and petty. I’d kill with kindness. Do the “right thing” Or what is perceived to be the right thing then i’d talk to others for validation and find out if theyv noticed you acting strange. I’d be specific, they’d notice.",t3_kh1cvg
ggji4df,t1_ggjhuhi,Medical professionals aren't allowed to diagnose or treat people they know - there are exceptions but definitely nothing that would usually take many sessions. You're lucky because psychiatrists are very expensive and it takes many sessions to get an NPD diagnosis - you got it for free.,t3_kh1cvg
ggkwu3b,t1_ggkb8d2,I guess it just depends on how open is the person to change,t3_kh1cvg
ggjfr6f,t1_ggjf4vm,"This is a collaborative website. Anyone is free to post, ask questions and learn. Mental health is an interest of mine, especially narcissism in the human mind.

ggjppkx,t1_ggiyxcp,"I had no idea one could be a narcissist AND also a doormat. This always confused me about myself.
Also, isn't the supply part of the problem? As in a healthy relationship there should even be a supply?",t3_kh1cvg
ggiqmg4,t1_gginjt6,"😁 Bro, no offence but you just talked about yourself the whole answer. Anyway, I appreciate that you put the effort in answering my post, thank you!",t3_kh1cvg
ggjn677,t1_ggji4df,True and she sees me for than 15 mins,t3_kh1cvg
ggjid47,t1_ggjfr6f,"Probably the subreddit titled ""Ask An NPD"", created with that very purpose in mind, or ""Narcissistic Abuse"" for more general advice on how to balance your trauma with having to co-exist with NPDs.

As per the rules:

""Only Narcs and NPDs may submit posts. This is NOT a place to complain about narcissists or or get help dealing with someone else's narcissism.""

The primary purpose of this particular subreddit is for people with NPD or NPD-traits to support themselves through recovery.

If you're on board for that, an alternative viewpoint is often helpful.

If you do not care about that and only want something from these people, seriously reconsider why you are here, what you are accomplishing, whether you can accomplish it in a better way and what effect this has on others.

We try to be pretty forgiving because we're really, really good at giving inappropriate and emotive responses to situations and it's better that people 'pop-off' and are gently explained the potential errors of their ways than banning wrongthink.

However badly the NPDs in your life have treated you, this is not a valid reason to use total strangers as toys, no matter their pathology.

And yes, the other poster is right - if you have as strong a response to Narc traits as a dog-mauling victim has to Pitbulls, hanging out at a dog pound is an objectively bad idea.",t3_kh1cvg
ggjk81p,t1_ggjfr6f,"well, first off, ***not in the support group by and for narcissists.*** like, anywhere else. ***anywhere.***",t3_kh1cvg
ggjqtrx,t1_ggjppkx,"Boy can you! The best doormat, nobody else can prostrate themselves as thoroughly as us! /s

And yes, there's a good reason NPD x BDP/ASD/ADHD/etc couples are prevalent; we tend to shack up with people who are fluent in our dynamics.

Supplies obvious plug into this equation and you are also obviously only half of it, but we are each wholly responsible for our side of the fence.

Sometimes, that means turning people down because it would be too easy to slip into bad habits with them, and thats for either side of the fence.",t3_kh1cvg
ggkftk0,t1_ggjppkx,"Yep, this is very common. Codependency and NPD co-ocurr.

One of the ways I finally found my diagnosis was after repeated abusive relationships where I was treated poorly and doled myself out to nothing.",t3_kh1cvg

Thanks for the informative heads up and I’ll keep the subs rules in mind for the future! I appreciate the gesture of explaining rather than banning.",t3_kh1cvg
