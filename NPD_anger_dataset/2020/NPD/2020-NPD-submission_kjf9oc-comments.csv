ggwdhgb,t3_kjf9oc,"These things sound like symptoms, yes, it’s possible. But you did well to come here and take steps to learn more about yourself and grow. I recommend finding a therapist that specializes in personality disorders (which arise through trauma) because even if you are not narcissistic, you may better fit the criteria of another personality disorder.",t3_kjf9oc
ggx1tfn,t3_kjf9oc,I just think as you get more confident in yourself and who you are that you won’t care so much about with others are  thinking and hopefully you can understand that it’s possible to change your mindset from one of  competition to that of one where everyone wins and realize  it’s not a thing of power or rather it doesn’t need to be. do you understand the difference? You’re gonna learn more watching YouTube. Everyone has narcissistic traits. They’re behavior patterns and can be changed. Don’t believe the lies. Look into psilocybin therapy. It’s quicker way back to you then therapy in  my experience. But by all means go to doctor if you need to. You always do what you’ve always done you’ll always get. My thc just kicked in so I’ll stop babbling. ***Hugs***,t3_kjf9oc

gh1ifhr,t3_kjf9oc,"\>I’m not sure if I’m a narcissist but I do have this need to prove that I’m tough and can withstand anything.

This is more a general indication of Cluster-B than anything in particular.

Idealising yourself and having a need to be free of negative characteristics generally indicates a faulty sense of self, specifically a failure to reconcile both good and bad aspects of yourself into a unified, whole object.

\>The slightest flaw brought up puts me in defense mode. 

See above, but very common in the Vulnerable / Covert versions of NPD.

\>I feel empty at times and have a hard time enjoy life in general. 

Swings both ways for Narcissism.

\>I also really like this one girl and continuously obsess over her (it’s been 6 years now)

Again for Cluster B in general, but can also stem from numerous other conditions and disorders.

My best advice is to review your early childhood (0 - 5) environment and primary caregivers and see if it matches common 'Origins' of Narcissism or other Cluster B disorders. If you think there's overlap, book a session with a psychologist for them to better unpack what has happened and what this means for you.

Good luck!",t3_kjf9oc
ggx3p64,t1_ggx1yv0,Obsession like that is usually tied into entitlement. People with NPD supposedly have 10 different kinds of fantasies. https://youtu.be/g-172Dfkqc4,t3_kjf9oc
gh1jhqw,t1_gh1ifhr,"Thing is, I don’t really remember much about how I was from 0-5. All I remember is that I was really lonely....all my siblings grew up away from me because of the age difference. But I had a pretty good childhood....my mom was kinda harsh with her words when she was mad but that’s kinda it. I grew up in a wealthy family but my parents instilled worth-ethic/consequences for bad behavior so I never thought I could get away with anything nor was I entitled.

I actually see a therapist who diagnosed me with anxiety/depression and ADHD but I think it may be BPD but then my ex called me a narc.",t3_kjf9oc
ggx4h5c,t1_ggx3p64,Thank you for the response and the link.,t3_kjf9oc
gh1l99r,t1_gh1jhqw,">Thing is, I don’t really remember much about how I was from 0-5.

So yeah, that's also a thing.

\>All I remember is that I was really lonely 

Also a common thing for NPD

\>my mom was kinda harsh with her words when she was mad but that’s kinda it

Was she emotionally validating / soothing? Or did you have to do that yourself? Try to step outside of the ""acceptable / unacceptable"" binary and critically evaluate what ""lessons"" you were taught by this person's actions.

I've posted about it, but my parents were incredibly loving in all aspects besides emotional validation or deep emotional connections, and it can be an uphill battle to move beyond the guilt of ""they did so much and it was clearly their best"" to ""i'm not sure they had a true idea of what their best could be to begin with because they never learned it either"".",t3_kjf9oc
