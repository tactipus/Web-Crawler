ghby2mg,t3_klqokm,"I think this is common for everyone... But I must say that my ex with HPD spent far more time doing this kind of thing (dressing up, changing clothes 3 or 4 times, spending hours doing makeup and changing it also 3 or 4 times, dying her hair every other week) far more than I ever did at my most narcissistic point.",t3_klqokm
ghbzf79,t3_klqokm,"Cos you base your self worth on superficial vanity which, when their is no genuine worth to fall back on, is basically all a narcissist is correct if wrong. I don't rlly see why what your describing, compensatory vanity if you will, is such a horrible thing like has been outlayed in most of your past posts. So you are kinda vain, wow, thats so evil (extreme sarcasm). So what lots of people are, what on earth could this have to do with being a bad person or whatever.

Basically an ego boost, that's all people do the same thing with buying expensive cars or whatever x",t3_klqokm
ghc73xx,t1_ghbw76o,"I swear I was a narcissist when I was a teenager or like younger teenager. I remember asking my friend when I was like 11 if she also felt like she needed to look good all the time. I would literally walk through the airport and like smirk bc I assumed everyone was staring at me and finding me really pretty.. I‚Äôm guessing this came bc I started getting a lot of guy attention early highschool. I remember even thinking college might know I‚Äôm smart and accept me even though I didn‚Äôt have good enough grades for top tier schools. This might‚Äôve been bc my adhd made me confused bc I knew I could do pretty good in school but struggled sm bc I couldn‚Äôt focus. I hated hearing ppl were mad at me and would pretend I didn‚Äôt hear anything hurtful. I even remember in middle school thinking that even though other girls legs looked skinnier that I was just skinner but looking at myself from a bad angle. I was ashamed as a young kid bc I had selective mutism in preeschool, dark hair (everyone else was blonde), and bc my narcissistic mom. I even remember in kindergarten hearing a girl tell me how she remembered my from preeschool and I quickly changed topics bc I was embaressed of how I didn‚Äôt talk.  I remember seeing a girl look at my legs in middle school and assuming she thought I had skinny legs- but looking back my legs were literally just hairy. I eventually grew out of all of these ways of thinking.  I always have had friends and never had a narcissistic reputation. I was rlly shy and reserved and ppl always call me sweet. I just think my mind was ducked up. I think it was bc my mom would abuse me than ask to go shopping and brush my feelings under the rug. She‚Äôs laugh and call me sensitive if I tried to talk abt how she hurt me. She would gaslight me too. I never realized she was abusive and having this and adhd emotional regulation issues I had trouble not rambling under my breath to her about how cold and rude she was. I had trouble not yelling at her. And all I felt towards her was anger and I couldn‚Äôt even feel guilt for the way I treated her bc she was so bad. I was ashamed and confused by my relationship w my mom bc she‚Äôd jump around perky and happy as if we were best friends and she made no sense. I even remember being embaressed of certain friends in highschool bc I did care how I looked. 

Weirdly enough I am a supportive friend and do have a good heart. I‚Äôm always happy for my friends success and am often told I should be a therapist bc im always there for them. I would always stay by their sides no matter what and genuinely care for others. I do score as having a really low score on the NPD test and I do have low self esteem so that makes sense. But I‚Äôve been able to understand my past which makes me a better person now.",t3_klqokm
ghc5zyq,t1_ghby2mg,Hahaha omg my cousin used to do this and straighten his hair like ten times a day than he would curl it. He was only a teen at the time though,t3_klqokm

ghezjl0,t1_ghc7tvv,"If you changed that around to the male version, it would be pretty damn similar to me. You scored low on the NPD test, but what about the hypersensitive narcissism scale? You can Google it, ""23 signs you are a covert narcissist hiding as a sensitive introvert"" or something. I took the test,got like over one hundred at one point, now it's down to 70 ISH.

You could also look into compensatory narcissism, sounds like we both have something in common yeah.

Your mom, yeah that ain't right sorry to hear about that.

Do you wanna know the not really offensive, but reasonable option of what I think is wrong?",t3_klqokm
ghf05gz,t1_ghezjl0,"I‚Äôve read that test a few times! I agree w some stuff on it but not all. The thing I will say is that I thought that way when I was in middle school and high school. But not after that age. I find it confusing because people say teenagers display more narcissistic traits but I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs really true. Because I do think that my way of thinking from high school changed. I think it was caused by the things wrong in my life and my mom kinda giving me that view point bc of the way she‚Äôd describe r family as perfect and tear others families down. I will say when I was 6 I won two ‚Äúlottery games‚Äù and I remember thinking abt how I was magically lucky and always won these games üòÇ

But yes what do you think is wrong?",t3_klqokm
ghm1ie7,t1_ghf05gz,"idk, maybe you got some ""narc defenses"" going on, it's probably the most common variation of narcissism, true NPD is narcissism in all forms of life, in all ways, it's much rarer.
just a guess gl with whatever you are trying to figure out.",t3_klqokm
ghnd8br,t1_ghm1ie7,I agree. I feel like I used to see through a narcissistic lease of being perfect or having a lot of attention or something. Do you think that‚Äôs normal as a teen? I feel like most of my traits were probably from being a teen/growing up w bad example/adhd/anxiety/ocd mix. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a true full on narcissist but would still like to get rid of any traits,t3_klqokm
