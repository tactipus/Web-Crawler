Adhd kid vs narcissistic mom

I’ve posted about my mom and people say she’s a narcissist but a part of me worries that I overthink the bad times and made it seem like she is. I have been recently diagnosed with adhd. I worry that having adhd as a kid I possibly was mean to my moms and verbally abused her and she just said mean things to fight back. Or maybe I was oppositional or overly sensitive to her actions and dramatized them in my mind. Since I also had selective mutism in preschool but also probably anxiety and ocd. My dad told me to do everything my mom said as a little kid and said it would be easier for me but it pissed me off and I remember angrily saying no. I remember my brother saying how he thought our mom was kinda mean when we were like 8 and I remember just casually saying I had known I hated her for while. I was diagnosed w adhd recently and wonder if I caused the issues at home

When I was young my mom used to take markers and poke me with them for a long time and the ink would go through my clothing onto my skin

On my sixth birthday my mom got upset at me and brought my cake upstairs. She than threw it onto the floor and smashed it in front of me. She says it was because I complained about not getting gifts but I don’t think that happened

As a kid she would lock me outside. Not for hours or anything though.

Some of my childhood memories may be suppressed. I have a hard time remembering. She tells me we only had a few really horrible days throughout my childhood and that I’m choosing to only remember these

But I remember she would rip my clothes off in a very harsh fashion 


I remember her tackling me as a child and banging my head into the floor. She didn’t do this hard but still. 

She would swear at me a lot as a kid

She would make me cry every morning before school freshman year of high school. She wouldn’t let me leave for school until my room was 100% clean and than still wouldn’t let me go. I walked into class trying to hide tears 



She told me that I bullied my automates in college and forced them into leaving. When that DIDNT happen. They just moved dorms because they switched into the honors college.

The other day I was sitting in the car and she shoved ten dollars in my face and than handed it to my brother. My brother asked why she shoved it in my face and she replied by saying “I just wanted to make sure your sister wouldn’t lie and say I gave you $20 later”. My brother replied “who cares what she thinks”. I feel like she’s putting a personality on me. I have never lied about money.

My dad is shy and never argues with my mom but the one time he stood up to her he told her who she is way too hard on me

I had severe severe trichotrillonomoa all high school while living with her and it went away as soon as I left for college. 

She recently dug her nails into my skin and left marks when I tried to show my dad a picture of my arm he claimed he was unable to see

She tackled me the other day and grabbed my head and told me she was just doing it to grab my phone but she wasn’t

She looses control. She gets this vicious angry look in her eyes and it’s like she has no control of her aggression

She constantly tells me how much better she was at my age

She compares me to my brother. My parents pay for my brothers apartment and they keep bragging about how he is acting as a grown adult by living in an apartment. She made a Joke to strangers about how I’m refusing to leave the home. However, at my grade level I’m supposed to live at home. Most college freshman return home over the summer.

She tells me how I say horrible things to my friends about her. Which isn’t true I try to not tell my friends what she’s like. I think she notices my friends are scared of her but it’s because they see how she is controlling.

I don’t know how to explain the fact that she doesn’t ever listen to anything I say

Once I was balling crying in front of her and she pretended to care for a minute. She was nodding her head pretending she cared and than snapped out of it. She’s also called it adorable when I am seriously crying. I think it’s insensitive

She takes credit for all of my high school jobs. She says she got them for me. However I worked as a waitress which required no help getting the job

She tries to convince me I have no friends despite the fact that I have close friends 

Something about her is toxic and I don’t know how to explain it. She has a way about her where she twists everything and lies to me. She speaks to me like she’s always trying to make me feel like absolute trash. 



She tells me the dogs avoid me because the dogs know I’m a bad person

I am 5’4 and 110 pounds. So I’m at a healthy wait and shouldn’t worry about it. However she took pictures of my stomach from a bad angle one time and laughed at me for a long time

She tells me she thought her mom was a narcassist as a kid and now realizes there is “no need to label people”

I had an appointment to get help with add and she had a fit. She tried convincing the doctor and straight ho said “she is here for drugs”. Which makes no sense. They also told her she could not sit in the waiting room due to corona virus and she threw a fit. Yelled at every doctor and made them seriously  uncomfortable. She does things like this often. If we get a smoothie and it’s a teeensy tiny bit not full to the top, she throws a fit and has the worker make a whole new batch just for that tiny bit. She says I don’t speak up about things like this because “I’m hiding my personality”. But truthfully I just don’t want to ruin employees days over something so small

I also don’t know how to explain this or if anyone can relate to it but she put it in my head at a young age that our family was naturally better at everything than everyone else, no questions asked. For example: If someone had more things than us or a nicer house, they didn’t have more money, they were just going into debt. I had to realize for myself I’m not naturally the best I guess

My mom will also talk trash all of my friends but than if my brother were to say anything about them she will stand up for my friends. It’s almost like she’s being fake protective

I also remember when I was 6 bought her a nail polish for Christmas and was really excited to give it to her. She looked at me and said “aww I’m gonna return in because I don’t want it”. Shouldn’t a mom just say thank you? Like it’s $1 and I was 6",t3_ko59b3
ghofa8j,t3_ko59b3,you may just be the family scapegoat,t3_ko59b3
ghoflk0,t1_ghofa8j,"So my mom told me I said something narcissistic. My dad said how “oh u obviously have adhd.. everyone who walks into the doctor and wants adhd has it”. So they won’t admit I have adhd. My mom added on saying “someone who goes in might not have needed adhd treatment”. I assumed she was talking abt me based on her tone and said how I clearly had adhd and match al symptoms. She said “narcissist much?? U think I’m talking abt u and everything’s abt u”.

I agree with u and feel like the scapegoat. But than why am I the mean one. Why do I verbally attack 
 people",t3_ko59b3
ghoxrpc,t1_ghoflk0,"because you are constantly in fight or flight, on the edge. another reason is ""get them before they get you."" another is attempting to defend yourself. so many reasons but what your doing seems to all be reactionary to being treated like shit.",t3_ko59b3
