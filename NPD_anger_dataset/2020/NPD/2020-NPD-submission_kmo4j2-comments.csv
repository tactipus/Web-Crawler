Well the last one is the odd one out. Autosexual preferences I have heard a few times from narcissists, but I have also heard it from a bunch of non narcissists - they just describe it differently. I think once someone thinks they're a narcissist they're more likely to say it's them liking themselves, whereas someone normal might say it's them feeling sexy and erotic.

Its hard to talk about mental illness and sexual fantasies, because mental illness usually means some sort of deviation from the norm that causes issues, but the privacy of sexual fantasies means they rarely cause issues, and how deviant the average person is means deviance means very little here. If someone at work says they like feet and someone else at work says they like gigantic boobs, which one is going to have more issues? Well foot guy, but do we want to say it's a mental illness or stems from one?",t3_kmo4j2
ghfu1k4,t3_kmo4j2,"I personally don't relate to any of these, but for what it's worth, I've heard variations of twin-cest and self-cest fantasies from several men who were not pathologically narcissistic. Sexual fantasy correlations to personality disorders would be a really interesting study! I'll try googling some later and update if I find something.",t3_kmo4j2
