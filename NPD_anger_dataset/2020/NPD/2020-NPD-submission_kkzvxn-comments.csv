gh5uiw6,t3_kkzvxn,"Ha! Funny idea.

I do have a mild case study for you. I know someone who has been very enabled.

He said he could have saved humanity through science and technology if he had been born 10k years ago. He'd have invented all science. Zero concept of how delusional that was. And he can't value any other life pursuit than his profession. Got sort of confused when I said "" well should everyone be in your field?""

He's oddly aware of his fragility. He explained it to me once that his trauma is like a reactor core for his life. He sees it as vital and gets adgitated and preachy when I suggest he could be more productive and happier with some healing. We chose very different paths.",t3_kkzvxn
gh5z554,t1_gh5uiw6,"Lol,  ""I was born in the wrong time"" is an amazingly convenient excuse to feel superior without lifting a finger!",t3_kkzvxn
gheqnrq,t1_gh5uiw6,That is so me haha I used to fantasise often about going back in time with an iPhone or a machine gun and taking over the world or inventing numbers and English or something thatâ€™s simple to me just because I was born now,t3_kkzvxn
gh5zi7r,t1_gh5z554,"Exactly! It's sort of low-key as far as what you're probably looking for but it's quite extreme..

He isn't shirking off tho! He believes he is going to save humanity in his lifetime and is a workhorse with many degrees and papers, etc.

But he thinks he would have been the first self-aware cave man and invented clear perception, logic/reasoning, quantum physics/computing in a single lifetime because he's just that good. 

This all came about when I brought up the origins of consciousness and philosophy. I asked him a hypothetical about being born an early human and off he went. He's just that defended in his identity.",t3_kkzvxn
