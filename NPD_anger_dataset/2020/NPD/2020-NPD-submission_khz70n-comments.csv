ggoh7rh,t3_khz70n,"Well it's narcissistic. You deal with it by challenging those thoughts - like the ones that make you think you're somehow better than others. 

But more generally, have you tried making friends with people you see as your equals? This might involve moving, changing career, studying - it might involve you having to work for it.",t3_khz70n
ggqj8gc,t3_khz70n,"I know what you mean. The friends I met at school was similar because they didn't seem to have any ambition in life, they were kind of mediocre and wanted to do the same thing every day, talk to the same people, do the same activities, etc..., until they die, and they didn't seem to care about the consequences of their actions. Most of that probably came from the fact that they were teenagers, and I'm maybe they're very different nowadays.

I've noticed that many old people seem to be like that too. My grandmother, for example, all she used to do, was wake up, make some food, do random things, watch TV, and whatever. She didn't want to go anywhere or do anything different, she kept doing the same thing over and over, and she seemed like a zombie I don't know. The same behavior was the same throughout my entire family.

When you're at school, you're forced to be with these people basically, and chances are they aren't very similar to you, and that's probably the reason you feel this way. What I recommend is searching for people who have the same interests as you. They will often be very enthusiastic at doing whatever you're also doing and be interested in talking about these things with you. That way, the feeling of ""everybody is lame and mediocre"" will probably be less prevalent in your life.",t3_khz70n
ggrzixf,t3_khz70n,ur getting nowhere on this thread kid,t3_khz70n
ggos8gh,t3_khz70n,The bit there Id look at is why do you think their interests are lame and yours arenâ€™t ?,t3_khz70n
ggq1zal,t1_ggoh7rh,"Yes but I don't find someone equal to me (not in a way that I am perfect but in the way that thinks big), it looks like everyone just want to live and die",t3_khz70n
ggstgzk,t1_ggrzixf,What should I do then?,t3_khz70n
ggq2n5n,t1_ggos8gh,"I mean it could be but no one questions them, I want to think big but they don't",t3_khz70n
ggqfvml,t1_ggq1zal,"Well lots of narcissists here feel that way, even if they're working on it. Wonder if there's a way to find people like that irl. 

You could write Tesla or Virgin a letter offering to work minimum wage to do data entry, then work your way onto their space programs? I'm only half kidding.",t3_khz70n
ggtibk5,t1_ggstgzk,"lol,  im kidding",t3_khz70n
