ggtwtl9,t3_kijvvj,"BTW, and check on the Google if you can't fathom this, BPD is considered the female version of NPD in many psychological communities. There is a very high rate of comorbid traits between NPD and BPD, and most Cluster B disorders to be perfectly frank. FYI, read some of my posts. And start reading up about your disorder. You are the problem here, no one else.",t3_kijvvj
ggrygfd,t3_kijvvj,"sounds like a pretty normal sugar daddy/baby arrangement, except neither one of u knew it.",t3_kijvvj
ggsf120,t3_kijvvj,"I wouldn't be surprised if he had NPD or some underlying sexual issues, but either way it doesn't matter. He has an issue and took it out on you. You were completely in the right here and I'm sorry you had to deal with that. Unfortunately this dynamic is hard to avoid. Some people are really good at hiding their red flags in the beginning. This may not be the best thing to do but...maybe you should test people? Of course one reaction from a person isn't enough but the reaction a person has when you press there buttons says a lot about them. Of course you shouldn't go out of your way to make someone feel bad but if you feel unsafe even emotionally I don't think it's a bad thing to do.",t3_kijvvj
ggt5pdl,t1_ggrygfd,"No, he wasn't a sugar daddy at all, paying for dates doesn't make someone a sugar daddy.",t3_kijvvj
ggtbodl,t1_ggt5pdl,"LOL. Always paying for dates absolutely makes him a sugar daddy and YOU are a sugar baby, kiddo. Sounds you both are classic turds with higher than normal narcissistic traits. You don't want that dynamic in the future? You change you. You can't ever change others, only yourself.",t3_kijvvj
ggtjktb,t1_ggt5pdl,"is your point to wine about a situation that u somehow have the internal workings of an entirely other person front, center, and top of mind, and thus no need to question the guy, his motives/intentions with u, and thus the full picture, and thus the lessons needed to know what the errors of YOUR ways where? 

username checks...",t3_kijvvj
ggtu240,t1_ggtbodl,A sugar baby recieves extra money. A man paying for dates is just being polite.... sorry that a man was never nice enough to pay for you on dates? And I've taken the NPI I scored average and sometimes a little below.,t3_kijvvj

ggttxqh,t1_ggtjktb,"I know what I did wrong I even apologized to him eventually he wanted nothing to do with me. And compared to my wrongs his were much worse. I never betlittled him like he did to me. I went into the situation happily with an open mind just to be insulted and continuously pressured into sex, then rejected, so I responded aggressively.",t3_kijvvj
ggtwe9v,t1_ggtu240,Congrats! You know how to lie! Just like we all have the ability to do on any online test. You are unwilling to take responsibility for your own part in a shitty toxic relationship and that makes you much more of a narcissist than he ever could be. #notevensorry,t3_kijvvj
