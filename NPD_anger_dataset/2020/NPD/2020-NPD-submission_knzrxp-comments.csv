ghnfd22,t3_knzrxp,I don't think they are very accurate for a covert narcissist due to most of the questions focus of the grandiose side and not the self-pity of a covert narc.,t3_knzrxp
ghs1zp4,t3_knzrxp,"I think Dr Todd Grande on Youtube does a dent job at explaining vulnerable and covert narcissism. A bit simplistic, I’d personally like more detail but that's because I make a hobby out of reading medical journal articles.. (Dont do that too much to the point of obsession, it's depressing). Dr Sam Vaknin talks about this stuff. Tests can only be so accurate. If someone isn't self aware enough yet or doesn't understand the question, it's invalid. If the questions are all picking between two choices, it's not the most reliable. If the questions aren't specific enough and can be attributed to too many other mental health disorders, it's not the most valid. I'd watch those two people and just read a lot about how other narcissists describe themselves. I’ve read things in here that match up with my life almost word for word. Read posts in here and memoirs (not a lot..). Look for books where narcissists get real deep and admit to how they really think and all of their tactics. If it doesn't click after that, you're not a narcissist.",t3_knzrxp
ghoustv,t3_knzrxp,"The tests measure how similarly you answer a set of questions to someone with NPD. They don't tell you how likely it is for you to have NPD. 

There is no official office test. There is just the DSM and the clinician's training in using it. I have never heard of these online tests being used by a clinician - their main purpose is to ""study NPD"" by studying instead college students who score similarly to how people with NPD score - note college aged students may well grow out of narcissistic traits, so this is all very dubious. 

The questions for the reputable tests don't matter, and people with covert or overt narcissism both usually score high. If the questions were about preferences in cheesecake and NPD people scored high then it would work just as well for your purposes. Everyone with NPD, whether covert or overt, has NPD as per the DSM. 

The reason the questions resemble narcissism traits is that designing the tests starts with guesses on what people with NPD would say but average people wouldn't. If they found asking about hotsauce improved the test then they'd add that in.

Here is a single question NPD test that appears to work just as well as the other ones. https://news.osu.edu/just-one-simple-question-can-identify-narcissistic-people/",t3_knzrxp
ghpv5sx,t3_knzrxp,They are not a good measure in and of themselves.  I was given a few tests and answered in such a way as to indicate I had very little narcissism and I was a very nice guy I was interviewed and diagnosed anyway so it is more complex than a test.,t3_knzrxp
ghqp6h5,t3_knzrxp,Accurate compared to what? The bubonic plague?,t3_knzrxp
ghni7ku,t1_ghnfd22,"I agree with ambrose. That's why covert narcissism is difficult to diagnose and people don't usually understand what victims of covert narcissists are experiencing. 

From my own experience as a covert narc, covert narcs are diagnosed more based on their actions than just their thoughts alone, if that makes sense. For example, I don't think that I am entitled, but me thinking about myself first in daily activities I share with my wife say otherwise. I say I don't require excessive admiration, but I work harder to please people at work than to please my wife at home. All these things are what I just learned about myself based on external observation. You can see that covert narcs may not think they do something, but the end result of their actions is the same as an overt narc's. Let me know if you need more examples!",t3_knzrxp
ghs2hm2,t1_ghs1zp4,"I wonder if it could also be about where someone is in life. I'm currently in a crisis in my life, so I don't know if my behavior reflects my true personality or if I'm simply being 'self-centered' in an animalistic, survival-mode kinda thing, because I literally can't afford to be selfless right now. The more I'm physically okay and safe and secure in life, outside of survival mode, the less I act ""narcissistically"".",t3_knzrxp
ghnjgl7,t1_ghni7ku,"Oh I see, it's more a subconscious thing. Really good examples! It seems like converts are better at twisting their perspectives in a way that puts virtue in their negative tendencies, to justify it to themselves. Whereas overt ones have enough self esteem to feel great about themselves even without justify their behavior.",t3_knzrxp
ghoop55,t1_ghni7ku,"I don't need admiration, but I have intense fear of being hated and ostracized. As a result, I always try to please my enemies way more than the people who I actually care about. My family know about this and actually called me out on my hypocrisy.",t3_knzrxp
ghq43oq,t1_ghoop55,Why don't you please the people you care about? Because you know they care about you and won't leave?,t3_knzrxp
ghq8tjt,t1_ghq43oq,"More like I've been faking myself all day and when I returned home, I was exhausted and could not keep up the false self any more. I literally told my family to let me be real for a few hours at home or I would go crazy.",t3_knzrxp
ghup87l,t1_ghq8tjt,"You sound like me. I fake being an ""awesome"" person at work, where everyone loves me, but am an absolute terror at home to my wife. It's really tough, but if you want to change you have to find your ""real"" self and apply it to all settings of your life. You can do it!",t3_knzrxp
ghvdouo,t1_ghq8tjt,"I got exhausted just reading that, lol. I don't have an awesome personality outside. I just keep to myself a lot...",t3_knzrxp
ghuw8a4,t1_ghup87l,Thanks!!! I've been working on accepting myself and toning down my rage and narcissistic injuries.,t3_knzrxp
