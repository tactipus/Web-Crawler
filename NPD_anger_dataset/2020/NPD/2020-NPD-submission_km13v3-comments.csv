Have you tried doing some self-analysis to see if there's anything (other than the obvious sources of supply), that brings you small amounts of joy, in and of itself?  Reading a book?  Listening to music?  Even if it's just very small snatches and moments of it?

&#x200B;

In my opinion, starting with emotions that require OTHER PEOPLE, is going to be an extremely hard battle.  Remember the core-- narcissism is ""not having a true self"".  Having a true self, means being able to experience certain things (like joy) that narcs often can't, or simply won't take the time to, experience.  Perhaps you could try focusing on that, slowly, and see if it makes for an inroad that allows you to start experiencing more authentic emotions, by yourself?

&#x200B;

Either way, I wish you the best of luck, and hope that you feel better.  I get the frustration of it all, truly I do.
