ggppjay,t3_ki8zj8,"Congratulations on getting into therapy! And congratulations on keeping up with therapy despite the defenses! Those are both legitimate things to be proud of.

Would you be fine reframing your statement as ""The narcissism tells me that my therapist is a naive fool."" You are the one going. The narcissism doesn't want you to go. But you're the one dragging that fuck in there every time for you to get a strangle hold on it.

""Hisses"" is a very apt word. Maybe my experience is different, but for the longest time the NPD was the only thing saying consistently positive things about me in my head. And when you only have one thing in your head doing that, it's extremely hard to work against it because it's the only thing making you feel good.

I have taken the time to cultivate an inner adult that knows what's what, knows when he doesn't know, and says positive things when I do things I can be proud of. Sometimes the adult voice takes exactly what the narcissism has been saying and reaffirms ""You know, this is *actually* true.""

You can be proud about going to therapy. Anything discussed there may make your narcissism hiss. But a neurotic cat does not run a household. Everything brought up in therapy is something for you to pick up, consider, and evaluate whether it will help you trap the feline.",t3_ki8zj8
ggpyjkk,t3_ki8zj8,It feels like my therapist doesn’t give a shit about me lmao,t3_ki8zj8
ggq6mk1,t1_ggpyjkk,"I know how you feel. My last outing at therapy ended after     my therapist didn‘t reply to my message requesting we take a break during lockdown as tele therapy was not practical while looking after kids. She finally replied 6 weeks later suggesting we have a closure session. I hadn’t previousply  thought about discontinuing therapy (I’d assumed she herself was not doing well in someway, and would have some explanaction for the lack of contact) but after that I knew I couldn’t continue, not with her. For someone to treat me with such carelessness, when I pay her $130 and hour to listen to my ABANDONMENT issues - the only self-respecting choice was to take the closure session, tell her how betrayed and unseen I felt and walk away. I know I need more therapy, but I’m just not ready to face the relationship building part of that again.",t3_ki8zj8
ggqvxgx,t1_ggq6mk1,Mine called my life “worthless” cuz I don’t do anything lol. Like ... damn.,t3_ki8zj8
ggq9vw7,t1_ggq6mk1,"OOF. That's really rude of that therapist, and you did not deserve that type of treatment. Much like all humans, therapists are not all made equally. I hope you do eventually find it in you to try another therapist, and be slow about the relationship building part. Just try to look at them as a white board you spill your story on. They don't have answers until you fill the spaces that are blank for them. And sometimes they just don't work out, some white boards can be too small or too big, right?",t3_ki8zj8
ggr0dsm,t1_ggqvxgx,"Geez, who gave them the authority to define your value huh? How a therapist could ever justify calling a person (a person right in front of them, that they are paid to help) worthless I cannot understand. I’m sorry you were treated that way - it is not fair or reasonable, and they should have known that. 

I don’t know if this is somewhat delusional or not, but sometimes I wonder if we are just societies [identified patients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identified_patient) with induced [role engulfment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role_engulfment). If we see the phenomenon in family systems, and work systems and educational systems, then it’s possible it’s also active on a much wider and universal scale... I have lots of thoughts on this but I need to be wary of falling down rabbit holes at the moment so will just leave this idea here for now, but yeah I do think there is some validity to looking at it like this.",t3_ki8zj8
