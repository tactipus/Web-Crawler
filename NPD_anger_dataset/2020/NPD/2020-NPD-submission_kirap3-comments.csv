ggsiwx5,t1_ggsi95v,"Dude, this subreddit is a support group for people with NPD, not a place for neurotypical bitches to throw fits about their arm chair diagnosed npd abusive ex who probably doesn't even have NPD.

If the person you are having issues with is toxic to you, cut them off. Stop going into a subreddit to tell people how evil they are for a disorder they didn't choose to have just because you are too much of a pussy to stand up for yourself. And learn how to spell.

You already figured out that the person you are having issues is abusive and toxic, so do yourself a favour, stop talking to them and especially, stop arm chair diagnosing people you don't like with NPD just because you have some hearsay knowledge about what the disorder is like.",t3_kirap3
