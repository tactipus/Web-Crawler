gh2itmo,t3_kki3pk,"full blown narcissism can be equated to psychopathy in that the person has no empathy for other beings, human or otherwise. Like you can a have an ego wall up to protect from shame or low self esteem and I've known people like that, but they don't callously abuse others for literally no reason besides because they can. Things like vanity aren't harmful in and of itself, it's your behavior particularly in relation to other people that defines it.

&#x200B;

Put it this way you can even cut all the fancy labels and conditions and disorders out of the equation and think of it in pure binary logic. Does this person treat others respectfully or not. A ""full blown narcissist"" is little more than a psychopath, their behavior matches well enough, their disregard for anything meaningful in the world matches.

&#x200B;

It doesn't matter how psychology defines something the only thing matters is the causes and the effects. Everything else is pointless label politics. Hell the way you described ""narc defenses"" I mean you're likely to find a majority of the population with those in some form or another. push enough buttons and you're likely to run into a wall in all but the most spineless of people.",t3_kki3pk
gh2j7n4,t1_gh2itmo,"This was an insightful post thanks, yeah like I don't relate to the concept of pathological narcissism and not caring about others or abusing others like wtf that's horrible. The ego wall/vn I relate to more.

But, do vns have a capacity to be aware (""a degree of insight into their own functioning"") and why would that make them feel self distressed on self awareness or even panicky over who they are? Why would someone prefer the idea of bpd over being somewhat narcissistic. So many people on this sub or other narc subs say like they feel like they have just become an android aware for the first time. I understand why someone would be down about the fact that they are a narc, but personally (usually only around Xmas as that's when my disavowed entitlement is in full swing) I felt anxious, other people in the house noticed this and said concernedly that I looked confused or went into a ""funny mood"". I guess I am just trying to accept myself fully, come to terms with it once and for all. Vns are apparently narcs who pretend they aren't narcs, but why would they pretend they aren't narcs, what is so disturbing about it to them.

Is it because it is ego dystonic? Is it because the ""punishing superego"" (I made a post on psychforums) about this ""detects self inflating fantasies"" and then tells the ego, i.e. basically a narc in question, that they ""should"" feel disturbed or shocked over what they are, that they should feel shame or guilt for having those fantasies in the first place?",t3_kki3pk
gh2ri7f,t1_gh2itmo,"This is a great answer. Basically does what you do and how you interact with others have an ongoing negative impact on yourself and/or others. That’s all that really matters here, for me, diagnostics can be helpful but it’s kinda semantic. 

Also, I’ve been scoring highly on the online NPD, BPD tests for years but only with a recent boost of self awareness have I been able to answer them somewhat honestly and recognise a lot of my own issues. A lot of them are phrased in such a way that anyone with half a brain looking to manipulate scores, or someone who has a lot of defence mechanisms firing won’t answer them accurately. I guess that’s whey they’re conducted by professionals but even then it can be a matter of opinion and the only person who really knows your internal state is you. A good therapist can bring a lot of what is hidden to the surface tho I suppose.",t3_kki3pk
gh4hb73,t1_gh2itmo,"Narcissism and psychopathy are not the same thing. 

Narcissists only lack empathy in the sense of having less than average - they're not without empathy in any way. 

It does matter how science defines scientific concepts.",t3_kki3pk
gh2oekq,t1_gh2j7n4,"ego wall is just response to trauma or ""invaders"" if you will. your ego is there to make sure you don't get taken advantage of so that you have a sense of self. it gets unstable and ungrounded when you've experienced a lot of trauma since you get used to being in a state of fight or flight.

people will say you're in a funny mood if your behavior is uncharacteristic from what they're used to out of you. one man's funny mood is another's norm. the only thing that should truly disturb you is immoral behavior, yours as well as other peoples. Being ego driven can be put to good or bad use, just depends on who you are and the choices you make, your reasons your motivations etc. The thing in a vacuum doesn't really matter all that much so much as how it's expressing itself in relation to its environment. Some behavior is offputting to me sure, nobody likes someone who's full of himself, but if that person treats his friends well unless they're actually insane they have little reason not to appreciate him for who he is. My friends appreciate me because I treat them well, even if I can be ego driven and full of myself at times. 

The narcissists who pretend they aren't it's because they know that going full dark triad in the open with people is social suicide, and likewise the feedback he'll get as a result won't reflect his sense of grandiosity. his goal is ultimately to live on a cloud with his feet off the ground where reality can't ""hurt"" him. he at a fundamental level hates truth and what it stands for that's why his actions are in direct opposition of it. Honestly you can liken it towards peoples idea of what an antichrist is. Like the darkness as an example, an anecdotal one, disappears when you turn on a lightbulb in the night. Something that is antithetical to light can't exist in the presence of light. someone who is a fundamental liar and deceiver can't exist in the presence of truth. that's why they'll end up lying about even the most inconsequential things, just to do it. it's not in their core function to do anything truth related",t3_kki3pk
gh4xwfd,t1_gh4hb73,"Yes. This. Ppl with NPD aren’t without empathy. The empathy is just impaired in certain situations when traumas are triggered. 

I almost feel like this disorder needs a new name. The word narcissism is so overused now. People either conflate it with psychopathy or they use it to describe their abusive ex boyfriends.",t3_kki3pk
ghlgk2o,t1_gh4xwfd,"I just realized around 6 months ago that I am a covert narc. I thought I had ""some"" empathy, but it was actually empathy only for myself. To have empathy for others (or learn to produce empathetic responses), I am practicing ""putting myself in other people's shows"" to imagine as accurately as possible what they may be feeling when something bad/sad happens to them. 

Narcissism is indeed a ""hot"" term right now. The Chainsmokers even made a song about it!",t3_kki3pk
