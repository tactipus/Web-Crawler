You got to get out of the gray zone go with your gut Don't question yourself You know you're right So why is he trying to convince you otherwise. Please take care of your mental space. I have lived this for 15 years and just now found the word for it and it has been so empowering.",t3_klejbn

ghqkdd3,t3_klejbn,"you described it perfectly. its funny looking back, i was always terrified of ""personality tests"" or even a question regarding what im like. it was that glimpse into insight, the opportunity to look inwards and ask ""who am i?"" and now that ive finally opened up to that and am slowly building that image its exhausting keeping myself in line. ive written down repeatedly the things that define me, how to identify when ive gotten out of line, what is morally wrong, empathy, love, tons of reminders that i have to reference daily. its like taking notes on being a human, im that bad at it.

the me i think of now, quite honestly, might not even be me. its impossible to tell. i still get those urges to throw out the unfavorable traits and build up perfection. i still get caught up in delusion (because lets face it, the delusions dont easily go away). but i notice that the more and more i force myself to face reality and endure the pain or embarrassments, i feel more human, and i notice humanity in my thoughts and actions. its gradual, and i might not even notice when im rid of those coping mechanisms.

i dont know if i will ever experience empathy or love like everyone else. that thought terrifies me because of how grossly conditional my feelings are. i like to be mean, i like to feel above people, i like to be dominant and- i say that. thats what ive realized, and it hit hard. the narcissistic things i say arent me. ""i like to feel superior when people are in pain"" sure, i might, but that isnt me. ive learned to distance myself from the idea of pain. honestly, that alone has pushed me closer towards an identity. ""you are not your narcissism""

what im saying is, its hard work. this disorder is the very core of us that we need to rewrite. every thought and action and feeling needs to be thought through. its a careful process. the idea of us doesnt exist, but there is still a person behind the scenes who needs to finally come out to the stage.

the nihilist in me says that will never happen, and im chasing a pipedream. and i dont know if its narcissism speaking in my hopelessness.

i wish you well on your journey",t3_klejbn
ghbvqx0,t1_ghb82rt,"I'm completely confused on what you are trying to say. Who is gaslighting whom? Who is ""he"" and what's a gray zone?",t3_klejbn
ghcfrv5,t1_ghcah9b,"Probably because I can only perceive myself in competitive relation to other people. The worse off they are, the relatively better I am. Thank you for suggesting shadow work, I've been meaning to look into it a while ago, then forgot. Any suggestions on where to begin?",t3_klejbn
