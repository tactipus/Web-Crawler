ghc1f2x,t3_klz78i,"Are you more covert? Part of my covert narcissism is that I wanted people to be aware of my accomplishments, and get the praise, but also turn around and say ""ah shucks. Stop that"" and further get the socially coveted modesty adjective.

That whole process is impeded when people are not aware of what you do, when they're not in your age group, when they're not in your profession. Probably why I also dumped points into cerebral-ness and somatic-ness because people can always compliment your physique.",t3_klz78i
ghceagg,t3_klz78i,"Yeah, I think of it can depend if you're more covert or overt.

&#x200B;

Covert here, and I SUCK at small talk-- just can't do it.  That is, until the topic turns to MY main interest or passion-- at which point, it's almost like being autistic, I can't stop talking about it, love the conversation, as it ends up reflecting MY values.

&#x200B;

I think overt narcs can do the small talk thing much easier, but it will more immediately revert to them, them, them-- their opinion, how they factor in, what they have experienced, etc.  Whereas a covert can't do the ""talk about them"" thing as much-- and might turn it into ""talk about WHAT I LIKE, in order to validate me"".

&#x200B;

Other than that, as a covert, conversation can be difficult PERIOD, regardless of the topic at hand.

&#x200B;

All depends what phase of life you're in-- where you happen to be getting supply, etc.

ghcp74k,t3_klz78i,Yes. I’m only good at talking to people I’m close with and all the others I just have issues opening up to them- I worry I’ll say the wrong thing.,t3_klz78i
ghdcfrr,t3_klz78i,"Absolutely. I get bored and sometimes sigh (uncontrollable) during small talk sections (especially group talk). Often, I will just pretent I didn't have enough sleep the night before to stay silent.

The only talk that get me excited is the one when people spill their/others secrets. I'll jump right in my adrenaline mode and immediately reach for my phone to record every words to listen to over and over again.",t3_klz78i
ghenxye,t3_klz78i,Yeah I can’t do small talk at all I thought I could until recently but Ive realised I always just turn the conversation to something political or philosophical when I don’t actually know anything about what I’m talking about or I’ve completely misunderstood something lol,t3_klz78i
ghbvn8y,t3_klz78i,"No, I suck at deep personal talk. Engaging new people is so much fun - I get excited to get to know them without passing any judgment, they enjoy the attention and reciprocate. But I don't connect with them as quickly or deeply as they want, and faking it convincingly is too exhausting. So relationships go poof. 

When you say you don't want to appeal to others, do you really mean it or is it just a sour grapes defense? Because craving validation is the core of narcissism.",t3_klz78i
ghg7dbh,t3_klz78i,"I'm not bad at it, but when I think that someone else might get more attention than me then I completely shut down and distance myself from the group, I get pissed and angry which others notice. I lose all interest in any conversations if I feel like I lost the attention of someone or when someone else gets more attention. I don't know how I can stop feeling like this",t3_klz78i
ghcs9um,t3_klz78i,If you have nothing to say then stfu and listen. Maybe you’ll learn something Or are you so beyond hope of changing that you just need to be center of attention all the fkn time????,t3_klz78i
ghdho6d,t1_ghc1f2x,"Great answer. I can relate to this, definitely acting modest and making sure nobody would think otherwise...

Interestingly, I read in multiple sources that no narcissist is only covert or overt, that in reality they always switch between the two. That has also been the case with me. Most of the time I am covert, but I have my overt days too.",t3_klz78i
ghdhzr5,t1_ghceagg,"Well said, thank you! :)",t3_klz78i
ghcvrph,t1_ghcp74k,">I worry I'll say the wrong thing.

This too. This was definitely fed by both NPD and BPD. I need to have plenty of observations about a person's views to know what things to avoid talking about so as to skirt around any possible rejection.",t3_klz78i
ghdh2of,t1_ghdcfrr,"Damn I can relate to this so much! Especially the part where people start spilling secrets or a conversation gets more ""controversial"". Strange haha",t3_klz78i
gheubf4,t1_ghenxye,Hahaha I love this,t3_klz78i
ghhirua,t1_ghg7dbh,"Damn! That's something that keeps happening to me as well, I freaking hate it. I can be very talkative at times, but when I think about it, it seems like I am not genuinely interested in others at all even though sometimes I trick myself I am. If i lost the attention of others I just leave or get visibly annoyed , it gets difficult to hide it.",t3_klz78i
ghcvw1m,t1_ghcs9um,Lol,t3_klz78i
ghdgzv1,t1_ghcs9um,"Haha well I do stfu and listen and I am very capable of learning from others, thanks for worrying about me :)",t3_klz78i
ghg64y1,t1_ghcs9um,Shut up,t3_klz78i
ghdobf5,t1_ghdho6d,"When I am invited to talk is the opportunity to slip in my achievements. So long as it's relevant. Doesn't come off as bragging so much.

But I really have a hard time recalling an instance where I listed them off unprovoked. But there's also not a lot of things that I am so proud of that I would want to make a conversation about it. I am usually more interested in other people. I ask more questions about them. Probably the BPD. But I also judge a person's social skills based on whether they reciprocate questions and take an equal interest in me back. I don't think normal people think like that.",t3_klz78i
ghedorf,t1_ghdhzr5,Welcome!,t3_klz78i
ghcwsb7,t1_ghcvrph,"Have you had experience saying the wrong thing a lot in the past? I feel like there are times I’ve seen people exchange looks when I say something, get mad, or disagree with me and make me feel bad and those are the situations that make me get more and more quiet. I just have a hard time telling if I’m right or wrong or just plain weird. I identify with both bpd and covert narcissism, myself.",t3_klz78i
ghdhoid,t1_ghdh2of,"Man! If I let a secret pass by without record it, I'll turn into a trainwreck for the whole week. In a way, recording make me feel secured as in if someone turn on me, I'll have their secrets to defend myself.",t3_klz78i
ghg70g0,t1_ghg64y1,that all u got slut?,t3_klz78i
ghcympb,t1_ghcwsb7,"Too a large extent, I felt like I didn't. But apparently that was a delusion. My family and exes would say that I said a lot of inappropriate things. I know they've said that I would jump in with a lot of sadistic jokes in earshot of people that didn't know us. Apparently I was semi conscious of it though because my last ex did a similar thing and it was a breath of fresh air to not have to worry about a dark or insensitive joke or observation. And I know that I was horrible at consoling others or giving advice. I probably should have been banned from even trying that.",t3_klz78i
ghdi6uh,t1_ghdhoid,"I record them too in order to have proof if they screw something up, can't believe another person is doing it and you're not even NPD. Do you have any other diagnoses?",t3_klz78i
ghhix70,t1_ghg70g0,"Go eat something honey, it will calm you down ;)",t3_klz78i
ghd00k5,t1_ghcympb,I can relate to this. It’s like no matter what I say it gets taken taken the wrong way or it is just blatantly wrong.,t3_klz78i
ghdixmm,t1_ghdi6uh,"Wow, I'm supprised there's another person similar to me in that regard. 

I set my flair as undiagnosed NPD since I've never had any psychiatrist officially diagnose me with NPD. But personally, I think I have NPD & AvPD.

Regarding my need to record conversation comes from the crazy amount of gaslighting I suffered in my childhood. The records are reality for me, if someone gaslight me, I'll have undeniable proof.",t3_klz78i
ghdj7jb,t1_ghdixmm,"I see. Damn, your childhood sounds rough, so I understand you want to protect yourself. I know many other people would think doing this is crazy, but I think it's very smart.",t3_klz78i
ghdjl5x,t1_ghdj7jb,"Thanks, so nice to have at least one person out there share the same train of thought when it come to defending myself. Have a nice day mate!!!",t3_klz78i
