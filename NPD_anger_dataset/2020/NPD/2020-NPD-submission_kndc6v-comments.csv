ghk9imc,t1_ghk8k0k,"It's okay to be a bit snappy about that but I don't have narcissism or NPD I can just relate to it due to being spoiled  to the point of confusion. I joined this subreddit to speak about my experiences more for feedback and to shine light on those with NPD, Narcissism,and those who can relate to it. Lol my relationships are a puddle of confusion maybe I should accept a confusing life and personality and see it as exciting for the new year and also I deleted the OP. Anyways I hope you are not offended and realize I know NPD and stuff related to it are very serious and ill. Why are you on this subreddit?",t3_kndc6v
