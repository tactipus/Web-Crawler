ghlqmu0,t3_knpjy8,"How did you get a copy of my internal monologue from 7-8 years ago? Like seriously. It's almost eerie.

What changed?

Intelligence is a plus. But it really is far from being everything. If you happen to be cerebral, it takes quite a bit of disappointment and otherwise-unexplainable failures to begin thinking intelligence isn't everything.

But until then, every failure that someone experiences is due to a lack of intelligence or forethought.

Ugh. That's really hard to shake.",t3_knpjy8
ghlt71a,t3_knpjy8,"You know I used to have this thing when I would get mad at people for being lazy, lacking drive, commitment and focus. 

I would seriously get pissed of when I saw someone whining about a bad situation rather than doing something about it. Whining about hard work, made me furious LIKE IF YOU HAVE TO SUCCEED YOU HAVE TO WORK HARD AND YOU WOULD WANT TO.

I used to be really proud of myself for getting me out of a lot of shit. For being on a good track on my career(writing a math book), getting better looking by exercise, and consuming self help content.

I have a hard time distinguishing between what is narcissistic and what is good. However, I have found that the drive and motivation that seemed to be endless in my case was kind of defense mechanism. Scarily narcissistic. 

In the way now that I think about it, it was that I was doing all these things so one day I could be proud of myself and not be the failure and loser that I am deep down.

And when I saw people like you mentioned especially my dad who I think is BPD not take any action to improve himself I would get very frustrated. Frustrated to the point that it became kind of the norm for my mind to blame him for not trying to do better. It wasn't normal, I would get mad at people in my class for nt beung motivated enough for their entrance exams and studying very little, putting the class back. I thought of myself to better than these people. In the I suposse you do too. 

What I think the core of the issue is recognizing that, we aren't inherently better people, as our distorted minds would love to think. We just take more productive actions. 

Moreover I think the lack of empathy part strikes really well here. I used to be like ""IF YOU ARE STRUGGLING SO BAD OR WANT IT THAT MUCH THEN WORK YOUR ASS OFF"" completely disregarding other people's emotional capacity. 

I have read that many narcissists are so driven and motivated, and oftenly sucessful. And I find this to be quite right.

You know why. Because these people in my mind where inferior to me. We narcissist's tend to make a hierarchy in social situations. And anyone who showed a flaw (for me it was weak worth ethic) my mind made them inherently inferior.

Other people aren't morons, nor are we inherently better/worse than them. We just wanna feel better about ourselves, because deep down: 

We feel like we have to accomplish something to not be worthless
We feel like if we are above if we place other people below

I know how hard this realization can be, I've been through it. 
It made me collapse in fact, haven't recovered since.
But it is the right path.

The fact that you are here is a great stride. 

Thank you for the opportunity to self-reflect, I hope you can find something here that can help you. Wish you the best.",t3_knpjy8

ghlsnsm,t3_knpjy8,"Get better friends. Get a better job. Make a better family with your partner. 

I managed to work with some very successful people, and yeah genuinely felt better. I would remember everything they said and took their advice to heart (which for me with low motivation usually was something valuable). They were too old to really be friends with though, point is there are plenty of smarter and more impressive people than you out there and you probably will be more comfortable around them. 

If you're like me, you're probably not that great and never will be because of childhood issues - sucks but that's how it is. You can't be a concert cellist if you start now, and you almost certainly won't be Warren Buffet, a famous artist, or politician either, and for much the same reasons. You started life on hard mode, and frankly if you can beat all the levels anyway that's more impressive than the perfect run of someone who played on easy.",t3_knpjy8
ghnjn2o,t3_knpjy8,"I can relate.

Though I came to realize, when I’m judging others it’s something my brain does to trick me to NOT look at my own shortcomings. I also have used anger as a control over feeling emotions, sadness, grief, depression, shame. 

When I spoke w/ a therapist he instantly knew it was from past trauma, and I was using it (anger) to actually medicate. 

The other thing he got me to think about, I no longer live in the jungle. I make decisions that are usually good for me, and if someone is not healthy to be around, I lose them pretty fast.

I owe it to myself!

Not any judgement here, your post resonated. Deep down I feel there are imbeciles & morons everywhere, and I need to focus on being present with people who I care about & those that care for me.",t3_knpjy8

ghoveh8,t3_knpjy8,"Stop being a people pleaser and worry about NOT losing losers from life. People are disposable and replaceable, the faster you go through life, the sooner you will meet those rare few which are actually intelligent enough to be worthy of wasting your time on them.

You know the saying.. if you are the smartest person in the room then you are in bad room. 

I’m sure they are a lot of very smart people out there go out and find them. Or just pick up a book, there are plenty of opportunities to be humbled. And even morons can often teach us lessons.",t3_knpjy8

ghmwze6,t1_ghlt71a,"Very similar story to mine.

&#x200B;

That ""relentless drive"" worked great, for a long time-- I did relatively ""amazing"" at everything I did, from music, to academia, to bodybuilding-- really ""ran the gamut"" over the course of 40 years, with different areas of focus separated by mini collapses (but too young, and not self aware, to realize it along the way-- I ""dug myself out"", started over with a new course and direction, and ended up excelling).

&#x200B;

Problem is-- all the people who ""couldn't meet my standards of excellence"", I walked away from.  And looking back, many/most of them WERE ""good people"" (by any reasonable standard), who just (mostly) had some ""totally normal person problems"" to work through.  Since ""I had no problems"" (of course), I had little patience or empathy to allow them to ""be human"", and work through it as they needed to.

&#x200B;

When then drive is never satisfied, it eventually has to implode.  Once you're making an insane amount of money (enough that you should be more than comfortable or happy for life)-- once you have the perfect trophy wife who TRULY cares about you -- once you have the physique most people would DREAM of having-- once you have a razor-sharp intellect that few can keep up with-- and it STILL isn't enough-- well, you keep pushing.

&#x200B;

And despite us wanting to believe otherwise, every human-- even every narc-- IS finite, and DOES have a limit.

&#x200B;

Driving myself at that pace for decades, led to a SEVERE collapse-- inducing noradrenaline depletion, dopamine depletion, major depressive disorder-- all of which was the first step to realizing, ""Wow, something DEEPER is wrong, and I need to get to the bottom of it, once and for all"".

&#x200B;

Problem is, by the time that happens, you look around-- and there's nobody else there, around you, who cares.  You're all alone.  And being completely alone, for a narc OR a normal person, kinda' sucks.

&#x200B;

SO, while having these seemingly ""high functioning"" skill sets can be awesome, and lead to a lot of (usually transient) success and satisfaction, if you don't check the underlying cause, they typically will lead to disaster at some point.  And the more driven, and the more skilled, seemingly, in many ways, the longer you will fight against it before allowing that collapse to happen-- which just means SO much more pain, and ""digging out of it"", when it DOES happen.

&#x200B;

Luckily, I did enough ""good stuff"" for enough people along the way, that I didn't burn EVERY bridge.  Working through things slowly these past years, I have finally started reaching back out to many of these people who were in my life (mostly related to my business), and they are still grateful for the time you spent together (typically, these are the handful of people who were NOT abused or used in any real manner).

&#x200B;

Being ""great"", sucks in many ways.  Gotta' be cautious.  Gotta' make sure you are finding some ACTUAL, TRUE joy along the way, rather than the ""joy of supply""-- which will eventually run out, because it's never enough.  And learning to experience some ""authentic"" joy-- like, being able to sit there and let the sun hit you face, and breathe deeply, and just EXIST and feel like enough-- man, it ain't fucking easy.

&#x200B;

And THAT'S when you start to realize-- shit, these ""fools"", they kinda' had a lot of it figured out, all along.  Wish I had known that decades ago.  Tring to play catch up on THAT front, is a tall order.
