ghdimdk,t3_km8fu1,Hold on to your moments of clarity and find help. Learn about trauma and find a therapist you feel safe with and challenge yourself not to leave if your start devaluing them. Think of all you have to lose in life if you don't get this worked out. You absolutely can make progress and recover. Fuck anyone who says otherwise.,t3_km8fu1
ghf2e37,t3_km8fu1,"I'm diagnosed with primarily bpd but am aware there are strong narcissistic traits there too. I reckon I'm actually a covert/failed narcissist. I'm about to turn 42 and am slightly ashamed that I've only become self aware over the last year or so. Some of my behaviours and actions etc make me now want to curl up in a ball and die. I have barely left the house in 3 years dur to the person i was and i have lost alot of good friends due to my ""past self"" as I call it.  Not sure if this is appropriate but I went down the rabbit hole of sam vaknin and I personally don't think he helps in regards to trying to change for the better. Dr Daniel fox on YouTube who specialises in personality disorders is quite a good resource. Dr craig malkin also specialises in npd and has some positive videos and articles. I just keep trying to tell myself its not a death sentence. Bpd and npd are arguably THE most stigmatised conditions within the general public AND with alot of mental health staff. Everyday I wish I could get into a time machine and change the past but I do believe positive change is possible. You built up defence mechanisms throughout your life to try and cope with whatever situations you were or still are facing. Its gonna take a while to learn more healthy realistic coping mechanisms. I'm only now trying to implement them",t3_km8fu1

And fuck off with this comment. Anyone can try to better themselves, why the hell would you discourage that?

OP, see a therapist. Itâ€™s been helpful to me, and think it could help you too.",t3_km8fu1
