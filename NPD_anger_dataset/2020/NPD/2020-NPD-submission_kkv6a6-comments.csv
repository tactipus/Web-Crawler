gh5up92,t3_kkv6a6,This disorder fucks up my life in all ways. I can't be happy with it,t3_kkv6a6
gh4qyyy,t3_kkv6a6,Spoken like a true narcissist,t3_kkv6a6
gh4wmpg,t3_kkv6a6,why are you glad to be a narcissist?,t3_kkv6a6

gh5ivqe,t3_kkv6a6,Oof,t3_kkv6a6
gh5bsvq,t3_kkv6a6,"It can have some good aspects, and some very negative aspects.  

The more you are aware of the plus and cons ..... and do something to keep yourself and those around you well .... the better and happier you will be.  

If you donâ€™t do anything against the negative aspects, you can lose great opportunities and be quite unhappy.  

I have quite family members with some of these disorders, and the more aware the better they seem to do.",t3_kkv6a6
gh7r789,t3_kkv6a6,"I guess if youâ€™re the functional kind and not just a self-aware parasite that has no clue how to hold a job because you canâ€™t deal with slight criticism.

Edit: like me.",t3_kkv6a6
gh9mp47,t3_kkv6a6,I feel I can't survive without hpd n npd traits...,t3_kkv6a6
gh7088b,t3_kkv6a6,"Same. I have traits, comorbid with avoidant personality disorder. Without them I'd be much worse. My narcissism is an anchor, it's what gives me hope.",t3_kkv6a6

gh4vxq3,t3_kkv6a6,Shit. Its spot on.,t3_kkv6a6

gh8hjcg,t1_gh4wmpg,That's the joke,t3_kkv6a6
gh4wxp4,t1_gh4wmpg,"being a narcissist isnt as bad as it looks from the outside (this post), bc in our minds we just have a heightened sense of self esteem. iâ€™m looking at the bright side because this trait pushes me to excel",t3_kkv6a6
gh6k3y2,t1_gh60mln,i cant say it wasnâ€™t hard for me to read this,t3_kkv6a6
gh6k73c,t1_gh5bsvq,i want to work on the excessive admiration partðŸ˜­,t3_kkv6a6
gh76au8,t1_gh7088b,!!!,t3_kkv6a6
gh4womp,t1_gh4vxq3,right!!,t3_kkv6a6
gh4z2ag,t1_gh4wxp4,"not all narcissists have a heightened sense of self esteem. have you ever heard of a covert narcissist? and yeah, people like us do often excel, but at the expense of others. a person should never be okay with being that kind of person. i know we're all narcs here and we're here for support but that doesn't mean that it should ever be thought of as acceptable",t3_kkv6a6
gh5ncf4,t1_gh4z2ag,Do appeals to moral principles or to caring for others ever work on people with NPD?,t3_kkv6a6
gh613kp,t1_gh5ncf4,"that depends on the person. usually, no. sometimes this will work with self-aware narcissists. 

the thing about it is that human beings cannot have empathy for others until they have empathy for themselves. this is generally a several years long process even for the self aware narc.",t3_kkv6a6
gh7y8bx,t1_gh613kp,"I thought as much, that's why your comment above struck me as a really weird thing to preach to a narcissist. I listen to my therapist because she appeals to my self-interest, and it's working pretty well so far.",t3_kkv6a6
gh7z23b,t1_gh7y8bx,"like I said it just depends on the person. i'm BPD w/ high narcissistic traits and my boyfriend is NPD. sometimes appeals to moral principals or caring for others works for him (and me) and that usually comes from a place of ""i don't want to be the kind of person who hurts people"". which i guess you could say is still self-centered, but it's at least not completely void of empathy.",t3_kkv6a6
