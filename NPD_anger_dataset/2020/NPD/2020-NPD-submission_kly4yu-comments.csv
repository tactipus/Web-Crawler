ghblk7x,t3_kly4yu,"I couldn't say with any certainty. About you. Or your ex. Labels are for a psychologist to ascribe.

But I wouldn't be surprised if both of you have problems. The last three long-term relationships I have been in respectively likely had cPTSD, NPD, and HPD. There are times where you treat each other like shit. There are times you project the shit you do. There are times you are the victim. Who's at fault? You both are. Go to therapy.",t3_kly4yu
ghbtgn7,t3_kly4yu,"A really interesting dynamic within narcissism is this:

*People with a lack of empathy struggle to empathise with how much empathy other people have.*

It's basically the Dunning Kruger effect but with empathy.

So, it might help to realise that he was actually being normal and empathising, taking your feelings into account. And then once you'll realise that the playing field is even, it might be much easier to argue with him. Instead of feeling attacked or taking it emotionally. Take it rationally and debunk his points like you would in a college essay - with facts. If you can't support an argument you're making, you might be wrong. You being wrong doesn't give him power, it makes your lives both easier if you both operate on factual reality rather than emotionality.

Figuring out where reality was in a relationship that's ended might be hard, but going over old messages/ texts with an unbiased mind might make you realise that you caused his behaviour and you failed to empathise at the time with how you might make him act like that. Or he might genuinely be an abusive narcissist that's manipulated you into thinking that you were actually the problem but you remember specific instances where you did something bad.

But it sounds to me like you were both victims and perpatrators, which is a harder thing to processes since it's not black and white. He was more overt and controlling while you were covert and manipulative. Instead of trying to make things better, you saught validation via invalid means by playing the victim when you weren't.",t3_kly4yu
ghblntt,t3_kly4yu,"Why not both?

If you’ve been the victim of narcissistic abuse, it’s incredibly common to defend yourself by using the methods modeled for you - if narcissistic abuse is the primary model you’ve internalized, how would you know any other way to be? We learn how to navigate the world, we are not born with an innate understanding of “how to be.”

I personally do this at times, and work very hard to recognize when I’m displaying “little n” narcissism (as my therapist calls it) as a defense. 

Also, I think it’s important to remember that one of the hallmarks of being a victim of narcissistic abuse is to minimize the wrongs done to you - since that is exactly what a narcissistic abuser insists is true.

What you’re feeling is totally valid, and you should be proud that you’re wanting to examine and work through it.",t3_kly4yu
ghblxwy,t3_kly4yu,Could be both narcissists. This happened with me too,t3_kly4yu
ghbpenp,t3_kly4yu,"Projection, absolutely.

And, narcissistic family systems are a thing.",t3_kly4yu
ghbzcsa,t3_kly4yu,[deleted],t3_kly4yu
ghegmi2,t3_kly4yu,"This doesn’t sound narcissistic to me. This sounds like you may actually be the one who is the victim. Maybe you’re really good at spinning that narrative for sympathy and supply and that’s why I’m picking up what you’re putting down. But is it possible that he does actually behave the way you say he does? Or maybe you both have NPD characteristics? 

To answer your original question, I do believe it’s common from those with NPD to project. That is basically a huge part of NPD. Have you looked in to BPD to see if that may resonate with you?",t3_kly4yu
ghbmgub,t1_ghblk7x,"Thanks a lot for this reply. You're quite right. And, yeah, I definitely have problems. I see a therapist and have been for around 5 years now; she feels that my self-accusations of narcissism are a defense against greiving my own trauma. I'm pretty sure that I have cPTSD (I was given a PTSD diagnosis before; cPTSD doesn't exist as a diagnosis in my country). After discussing my ex's behavior for a long time, she has likened it to an abusive relationship but says that she is doing that only to provide a point of comparison and obviously cannot make any pronouncement about him. I definitely see where I've been at fault. 

The reason I ask this is because (1) I'm trying to figure out if I can continue to have this person in my life. My instinct has mostly been to cut off, but he says (and I've come to feel) that that is just denial/avoidance of my true feelings (i.e. devalue/discard). My instinct can then lurch to massive 'what if he's right and we are soulmates omg I feel it too' thinking  (i.e. idealization). (2) I want to go deeper into introspection and learn more about the worst parts of myself.",t3_kly4yu
ghbyat1,t1_ghbtgn7,"Thanks, that parallel with the Dunning Kruger effect is actually incredibly helpful. The case here is that he wants the relationship to continue (either romantically or as friends), and has insisted upon that for 7+ years despite me trying to pull away and going no contact (or, as he sees it, ghosting) for 3 years. 

I think a lot of my problem when communicating with him is that I'm basically trying to *manage* my interactions with him to avoid his negative reactions or accusations. I also find it hard to put myself in his shoes (something which is not usually a problem for me). I just can't understand how somebody could pursue someone so persistently and how he can go from accusing me of cowardice/immaturity/instability one minute and then the next minute saying that all comes from a place of love and calling me his soulmate/twin flame/etc.

From a factual perspective only, I can see that we have both had bad behaviors here. Basically it boils down to what you said: he is more overt/controlling and I am more covert/passive-aggressive. We have both been victims and perpatrators, and it is definitely harder with that being a gray area (especially since we are both prone to splitting). I guess the reason I want to find out more about how much of his bad behavior is imagined by me is because I want to see if I really should get back together with him as he wants. If I'm projecting, it may be worth it due to how much we have in common.",t3_kly4yu
ghbn0dh,t1_ghblntt,"Thanks a lot, that's really helpful. And it's especially good of you to remind me that what I'm feeling is valid, since I spend most of the time accusing myself of various stuff. The label of 'little n' narcissism is super helpful here! 

Yeah, I've heard that people in abusive situations often come to see themselves as abusive or to minimize the pain caused to them. I just have no way to figure out what is the case objectively. If I am projecting an abuser image onto him, I want to take ownership of it and stop doing that so we can move forward productively.",t3_kly4yu
ghc0vzu,t1_ghblntt,[deleted],t3_kly4yu
ghbmozn,t1_ghblxwy,"Thanks a lot. I *definitely* have displayed some narcissistic traits which I'm working through in therapy. And he *definitely* has a lot of them too (I mean, he says he likes to masturbate in front of the mirror, feels like talking to me is like talking to a mirror, and has problems seeing things from others' perspectives). 

In your case, how did you figure out that you were both narcissists?",t3_kly4yu
ghbpnfx,t1_ghbpenp,"Thanks a lot! If you like/have time, please can you elaborate? I'd love to learn more from how you arrived at that conclusion.",t3_kly4yu
ghc05v4,t1_ghbzcsa,"Thanks so much for the solidarity. I massively appreciate it. This is exactly the spot I've been in for 8+ months now: am I being gaslight or am I being abusive? The simple answer I often get is: well, if you're asking that then you're *definitely* being gaslit. The trouble is that that response just shores up my idea that 'well, I must be really abusive because I've deceived them as well and I'm just asking them to get reassurance that I'm not abusive' etc etc etc 

It's a terrible spiral. I hope you are doing OK and hope you find clarity and healing too. If you ever post about your situation, do let me know, it would be interesting/helpful for me to hear from a similar situation I'm sure.",t3_kly4yu
ghbnunw,t1_ghbmgub,"Well, here I can actually say something with certainty. You're supposed to be single.

The cycle of idealization and devaluation and him talking you into staying and you wanting to discover yourself isn't going to go away. That's a codependency. Your feelings for him shouldn't be based on intermittent persuasion. And he actually deserves someone who feels certain about him. And you deserve to explore yourself without feeling tethered to someone else.",t3_kly4yu
ghegywm,t1_ghbmgub,"Seeing where you are at fault doesn’t sound narcissistic to me. Maybe you are a highly evolved narcissist. But more often than night, evolved narcissist are a rare breed. If you are actively seeking to identify and acknowledge fault, it seems like it’s an oxymoron. Someone with NPD doesn’t do that. They are perfect and can do no wrong. The other person is 100% to blame.",t3_kly4yu
ghhbbgv,t1_ghbyat1,just tossing this out there. but you on the fence about whether you want to get back together with him or not means that you need to seriously consider your relationship with your current SO. May be time to be single and do some self work.,t3_kly4yu
ghbr768,t1_ghbn0dh,"To be clear, I don’t think you’re projecting onto him - he is a narcissist. Take this as an opportunity to listen to your gut. 

But I do think you can both be a victim and display learned narcissistic habits, and that doesn’t make the abuse you’ve suffered any less real or traumatizing.",t3_kly4yu
ghc23a9,t1_ghc0vzu,"Personally, part of the work I’m doing on myself is recognizing and breaking the cycle of generational trauma. Part of that is a commitment to no longer engage in the destructive behaviors that harmed and hurt me.

I don’t think it’s ever necessary to be narcissistic - there’s always another way in my mind (I feel differently about being selfish, if that needs to be said).",t3_kly4yu
ghc13n1,t1_ghbmozn,"Well once you suffer narcissistic abuse it doesn’t become as obvious as you might think, so it wasn’t until I read up on this shit that I realized. He would gaslight me, lie, cheat, push and pull, withhold affection, create random drama for no reason, etc. 

It wasn’t until I dated an actual decent guy who wasn’t exactly a narcissist, and he sent me a paragraph after our breakup about how I manipulated his weaknesses, was jealous and controlling, and basically created so much toxicity in his life. I thought this was because of my borderline personality disorder, but then I learned that BPD and NPD overlap in many ways. I realized that a lot of my traits in that relationship were narcissistic rather than borderline. So I’m still not sure which one I am, all I know is that I’m kinda fucked up LOL. 

I do use people, I don’t have as much empathy as I’d like, I do lie and manipulate to get my way, I do feel much better after I see that the person has been broken down...my sister has always called me a psychopath but I just assumed it’s because she’s super docile in general. 

I asked my best friends and they don’t see it at all really. And what I realized is that it’s mainly with a man where these toxic traits arise, not really with women. I think I have an obsession with breaking down narcissistic men. I’m not sure...",t3_kly4yu
ghbpxz6,t1_ghbpnfx,"Well, I don't know if it's as much of a conclusion. It's part of the literature, but not part of popular discourse.

You can check out The Narcissistic Family: Diagnosis and Treatment

Book by Robert M. Pressman and Stephanie Donaldson

It's not suggesting that everyone in the family has NPD to meet diagnosable criteria. It's out of family systems theory and internal family systems theory. And the point is that traits run in families. Also codependent and narcisstic interpersonal dynamics. Props for breaking out of an echo chamber and owning your own behavior.",t3_kly4yu
ghbov3w,t1_ghbnunw,"Thanks. That makes a lot of sense. 

My SO is aware of the situation with my ex and has, so far, been extremely generous in understanding. I know he deserves way better (he is actually a very stable, securely attached person and not a fuck-up like me/my ex). I know it can't go on for much longer before my SO realizes that too and then he'll leave. So I may have no choice soon enough.",t3_kly4yu
ghhoikx,t1_ghhbbgv,"Thanks, that makes sense and I have been considering the same. Being single would probably the most courageous and rational decision in some ways.

For me, my automatic response in a situation like this is just to move on, and let this person and this story fall out of my life and stay in the past. Sure, you ruminate about that person for a while but after whatever amount of time you forget about them. I've tried to that with him for several years. While I was enforcing 'no contact' for three years, I *did* think of him but this obviously decreased over time. It would catch me in dreams etc. but I was moving on, *apart from* the fact that I kept receiving messages from him. Getting a message from him would always keep that possibility alive in my mind while I was trying to let go. This meant that I couldn't just wait to forget; instead, I felt like I was being forced to remember.

From his perspective, I ghosted him, did not give him the closure I owed him and treated him as less than human by doing so. Since I couldn't bring myself to block him completely on all platforms, he took it as a sign that I was still interested and that I was still keeping him 'on the hook'. Earlier this year he started sending me messages every day and eventually, in a moment of emotional vulnerability, I responded. For him, me responding to his messages is a sign that I am still interested in him. 

If I am really *not* interested, how come I could never bring myself to block him everywhere? From my perspective, it's because I got some sadistic thrill out of getting his messages, felt it would be cruel to block him entirely, I had residual feelings for him getting in the way, and I also assumed his messages would decrease in frequency to 0 over time as he realized it was hopeless. From his perspective, it's evidence that I am still secretly in love with him. Yes, of course, I have *a lot* of residual feelings for him but I was trying my fucking best to forget about him and move on. I feel like I could have moved on, if he had left me alone! Maybe that's not true and maybe I'm blaming him for my feelings. 

He has tried dating 20+ people in the three years we've been no contact, and says he has not found anyone close to me. He says I don't realize how rare what we have is. The answer to that is definitely something I can only figure out by being single. I have no fucking idea. All I know is that my SO is a great guy and he's been put in an incredibly unfair position. I want to be single if only for his sake!

Sorry for the rant... oops... :/",t3_kly4yu
ghbs66m,t1_ghbr768,"Thanks, that's helpful. Yes, I *definitely* have displayed narcissistic habits in this case.

ghbq6rm,t1_ghbpxz6,"Thanks a lot. I'll definitely check that out. My comment was unclear: by 'conclusion' I was more referring to the first sentence of your comment ('Projection, absolutely').",t3_kly4yu
ghbs2nx,t1_ghbov3w,Well that's negative self talk and mind reading.  Those aren't reasons to go single. But it is clear that those are the kind of issues you should resolve during your self work.,t3_kly4yu
ghc0ng6,t1_ghbs66m,"I try to remind myself that I do not have to achieve perfection in order to deserve and receive the bare minimum of love, respect and care from the people around me. My childhood conditioned me otherwise, so I know it’s a struggle! Good luck, we can do hard things!",t3_kly4yu
ghcrk5x,t1_ghc6slz,"Narcissism is inherently selfish; not all selfish acts are narcissistic. 

My sister and I always joke that kids are little sociopaths for that very reason - to figure out the boundaries and how to enforce them as well as test them.",t3_kly4yu
ghbqqmg,t1_ghbq6rm,"Ah. Because it's so common to first identify what we don't like about our behavior in others. And especially if it's actually there in yourself and your partner, this dynamic will play out. If it's not there in you, you probably won't project about it. It's likely you're detecting something from the partner. May not be to the degree you see it. But it also may be. These are hard situations to suss out.",t3_kly4yu

ghbrhzv,t1_ghbqqmg,"Yeah, definitely hard to suss out... thanks again :)",t3_kly4yu
ghbvuy0,t1_ghbsmlm,"Take care. It'll all be alright. 

In any case, I doubt you have NPD just based on the negative self talk. Maybe some narc traits, but not NPD. Both cPTSD and BPD have overlapping behaviors with NPD, but the motivations are usually different.",t3_kly4yu
