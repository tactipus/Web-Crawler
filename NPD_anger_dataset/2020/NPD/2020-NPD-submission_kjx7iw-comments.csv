ggzcwfc,t1_ggzcb8e,"Yeah you should,
I am investing my mental stability watching my friend social media. Analysising his behavior.
I am self destructing.

This guy was my roommate in college
I thought he had very good self confidence I thought he was cool. I even loved how he has so many friends.
I was like ""i want to be social like you""

He is so socially amazing yet he is So Sad and dead Inside.
How can you have so many support yet no esteem.",t3_kjx7iw
