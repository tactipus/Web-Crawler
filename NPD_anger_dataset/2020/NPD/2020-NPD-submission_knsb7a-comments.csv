ghmbajk,t3_knsb7a,"I definitely need to think through my intentions behind writing it, thank you for the advice",t3_knsb7a
ghmk7jz,t3_knsb7a,Never contact them again never give them a way back. Once we find a way back to get control we will utilise it the fact you need to write sounds like a want of closure.,t3_knsb7a
ghnf4te,t3_knsb7a,You can of course write down any feelings you have on a piece of paper but why send it? What benefit would you gain from sending your ex a letter explaining how bad he hurt you and making him proud of his actions?,t3_knsb7a
ghm8nzt,t3_knsb7a,"I’ve written several and never sent. The crowd at r/narcissisticabuse convinced me that it would only serve as a form of supply

Curious to hear the perspective of anyone in this sub",t3_knsb7a
ghpwc97,t3_knsb7a,"Just my perspective but he will probably take it as an attack when he’s in a position to do nothing about it/vulnerable.  It will probably cause a lot more resentment towards you in my opinion.  

I understand the need for closure but why now and why in this situation?  Seems to have a vengeful flavor to it, like here stew in this while you have nothing but time to think",t3_knsb7a
ghmuwtv,t1_ghmtmt4,My bad thank you for the feedback,t3_knsb7a
ghmkjbi,t1_ghmk7jz,"Its definitely coming from a need for closure,  any suggestions for an alternative ?",t3_knsb7a
ghm9ddi,t1_ghm8nzt,"Supply as in ; I'd more than likely be giving him some kind of gratification with the letter ? 

(Side note : it's been like 2 1/2 years since we last spoke,  just incase that has any relevancy to whether I should or shouldn't )",t3_knsb7a
ghvofqc,t1_ghpwc97,"That's a really good point , I didn't realize how it would come across that way && I guess  it is kind of a resentment fueled desire",t3_knsb7a
ghman5w,t1_ghm9ddi,"Yeah, supply = gratification/attention

It depends on what you want to say, what the situation is, what result you’re looking for. 

I highly recommend you write it. Once you do, sit on it for at least a day or two and go with your gut",t3_knsb7a
