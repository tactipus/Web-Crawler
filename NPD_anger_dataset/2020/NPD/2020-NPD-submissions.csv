ko59b3,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/ko59b3/i_feel_like_i_have_narcissistic_rage/,I feel like I have narcissistic rage,3,4,1609476677.0,I’m the one in my household who is verbally abusive. I’m the one who tears people down and is mean. I’m the one who gets angry constantly at them. I sit down and tell my parents every absuive thing they do. I just get so mad and explode. I’ll leave why I think my  mom is a narcissist in the comments.. she says she’s only mean to my as a reaction to me and my own abuse. My whole family is against me and trashes me. It makes me feel like I really am the problem. But my dads head perks up when she walks by and he begins screaming at me and he’s afraid of her. I just can’t tell. Am I overthinking the things she’s done wrong? Have they all been reactions to me and my issues. They all call me a loser and make fun of me and laugh. I literally am mean to them so I get it. They all say I repeat my parents msitakes and that it’s embarrassing to call them abusive.  I was angrier tonight than normal and rambled for an hour abt how unfair my parents are bc I drank alcohol on top of my adhd medication which isn’t a good idea. I’m just so annoyed. I don’t get it. Everyone online says my moms sounds like she has mental health issues but my family acts like I’m crazy and mean. The thing is I am mean to them. I remember rambling mean things to my mom as a kid under my breath. They always pick on me and bully me and others and it’s so annoying. I just can’t stand them anymore. Once I realized they were abusive.. I just feel like everything they do makes me mad bc im so sickened by them. I think my moms gotten narcissistic rage bc when I calmly explained how I’d grown as a person and asked for an apology she went INSANE spewing insults at me and was talking in a creepy voice. She reacts calmly when I’m upset tho and I feel like I was mad in a different way than she is. Like I’m so mad I just need to let it out. I just get confused bc I can’t contain anger towards them anymore. My brother yelled and swore at me for stepping in his room to pet his cat .. he didn’t yell he was just talking cruel and said it’s not my cat to pet which I get but I legit just wanted to pet the cat. And that set me off to start attacking him and my family. But it’s like I feel like they deserve it. Ik it’s wrong and will never result in my parents changing or helping anyone and verbal abuse is never ok no matter what but I pretty much just sit their saying all the mean things they do to me. I did repeatedly call my brother arrogant and an asshole and call him mean and horrible. Idk I just can’t contain it.

In fact I am projecting my low self-esteem in a bad way against her. I am trying to do my best guys. I love this woman so much, I dont want to hurt her.

She loves the shit out of me too. I know that.
I hate that she can see right through me.
Right through my damaged soul. All of the things I do to try to seem confident and self assured only that she could have a man that is strong and attracted to.

And damn am I putting on a facade. I am putting on this mask of being the perfect man for every woman that seems to sell. I am trying to sell an image of me, not my true self.

And you know what the worst thing is(the best to be honest). She loves me when I am real, with all my insecurities and shortcomings. I have become this narcissistic piece of shit because I think that this is how I could protect myself and be the best.

But all she has told me is, I loved you how I met you. With your flaws and insecurities. Maybe I just don't know how someone could love my true self 

But today happened something amazing. I have found these 3 amazing people I can call friends. We hung out today and I did my best to tell them how much I am struggling with my girlfriend and most importantly my self esteem.

And these amazing motherfuckers held me while I was crying. These people loved the true me. Without putting on a mask. This gave rise to the guys to tell each other their troubles and we all cried and hugged together. It was amazing!

These guys gave me the motivation to talk to my girlfriend (an amazing confident person). And I said today no putting on a mask. I didnt plan how I would interact with her, as I impulsive would have. 

This great support system (amazing people) had given me the courage to talk to her again.

And she didnt hate me.

She isn't this person in my mind. The person my mind makes up to defend myself from the person that loves me the most.

I want to be a more real person to those who deserve it.

I dont want to hurt people anymore. Especially people who love me.

I AM TIRED OF PUTTING ON THIS MASK.

I am tired of draining myself.

We all are inherently good people. We just have learned that we aren't and have developed defensive mechanisms harmful to other people and to us.

Here is to trying to give it your best. And still failing. Because giving it my best and railing is okay with me

I WISH ALL YOU WONDERFUL PEOPLE A HAPPY 2021

I wish all of us to get better. Because a single person being a better and truer version of themselves is what makes this society better bit by bit.

Love you all!"

knn6mf,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/knn6mf/does_this_sound_like_npd/,Does this sound like NPD?,13,1,1609407798.0,"For a long time I have considered myself an empath. I am now curious that I might lack empathy, or at least emotional and compassionate empathy. I have high emotional intelligence to the point of feeling psychic; I believe this is called cognitive empathy. I can read most people very well and predict their actions and reactions with little effort. I’ve always been this way. I don’t know if it’s a survival thing because I feel like I’m not sure how to act much of the time, so focusing on cues from others helps me to become who I need to be in a given moment. It’s like I can suck a person’s very essence out of them in order to understand how I need to behave around them. I prefer manipulating people to give me what I want, rather than asking for it, because then I feel like I’m appearing selfless or more innocent, and that lets me fly under the radar. I use the word “manipulate” knowing that it has a very negative and frightening association, but I have to admit that’s what it is. I’m keenly aware I’m not like other people. 

At any given time in a group of people I feel like there are so many tasks to be completed rather than moments to be enjoyed. It’s almost impossible for me to relax and enjoy myself without alcohol. When I start to drink, I like to laugh and joke around, and then I feel happy. I feel happy when I’m able to express myself, but can’t do it without a little wine.. Most of the time, I feel “successful” that I’m able to operate people, but that doesn’t make me happy. Sometimes, however, it’s a lonely kind of giddiness, usually when I’ve dramatically influenced someone to behave in a certain way. 

It can become depressing to watch people do and say the same things over and over again. It’s easy to make someone fall in love with me; it’s happened countless times (I myself have only been in love 6-7 times). A lot of times when they start to confess how they feel, and how they’ve never felt this way before, and how they’ve never met anyone like me, I feel sad and unstable. They are supposed to be the guiding force, the one in charge. It’s like I enjoyed being praised so much that I forgot to find something I so much as liked about the other person. I know this is very selfish. Then there are men like my ex, the alphas (or alpha actors), who will offer me the emotional security I need, because they don’t bother me with their own sappy emotions. Their stories, yes, their traumas, yes, but not their whiny collapses. I can’t stand that. I crave information rather than pure feeling.

When I see someone crying--let’s say it’s a stranger--I will want to know what’s going on simply because I’m curious. I may seem like a calm and serene person to most, but I love observing drama. So when I see someone upset, I don’t feel what they’re feeling, even though I myself have been deeply hurt and anxious throughout my life, and on occasion depressed. So I recognize the emotion, but don’t “feel” it myself. If someone is crying in any setting I need to discern a reason for their pain before I can feel sympathy. Much of the time I feel bemused. One time I made the mistake of laughing at one of my friends when she was crying because I thought she was making a self-deprecating joke and just being dramatic, then when I saw she was shocked I tried to fix it with a hug.

With people I really love, I will feel strong pity and occasionally sadness for their pain--but I don’t believe I’m feeling what they are feeling nor am I consciously considering it. I just want to help them feel better in the moment, and to let them know that I do care. I never seem to say exactly the right thing, and pretty quickly become uncomfortable. Sometimes, if someone is going through something similar to what I’ve experienced in my life, I will go out of my way to help them because I myself have been there. But I cannot say I would go out of my way if their plight hadn’t been familiar. 

Many times when I see people cry I will feel nothing, followed by disgust or irritation. Every now and then, and it’s very slight, I will feel pleasure that they are being so over the top--it’s like I’m delighting in their drama, or maybe even their pain. But for most people, I would never actually want to cause them pain (unless I feel they have wronged me--I have a VERY strong revenge trigger). I will also say that when someone I am close to has been wronged, I will feel empathic rage. Like I’ve been close to calling up friends’ abusive exes, or even worse. I’ve experienced extreme traumas throughout my life, so part of me feels like I would have wanted someone in my corner to “kill” on my behalf (not literally, please don’t report me--lol). But my friends will never feel as vengeful as I do, and even THAT makes me angry, even though it’s their own trauma and not mine.

What the hell is wrong with me? This isn’t all of my life story, but I’m curious if anyone else on here recognizes any of what I’ve expressed."

knbsow,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/knbsow/am_i_a_narcissist/,Am I a narcissist?,0,2,1609365400.0,"Long post, thank you in advance

I am struggling a lot right now and feel like I am questioning my sanity. Background, I have a history of depression and attempted suicide when I was younger. Therapy and family/friend support networks helped me get through my depression at the time. I did therapy in High School and in College. I was never labeled anything, rather I was a gay man struggling with a lot of family issues regarding my sexual orientation and dealing with an extremely toxic relationship.

&#x200B;

I have been in a relationship with a man with BPD for about 6 months now. Everything in the relationship I have been truthful and honest about except for information pertaining to a specific hook-up. I lied about specific regarding that hookup to my boyfriend because I am quite ashamed about what had happened. I had finally ended an on-and-off relationship that was hurting me too much. Less than a month later, I ended up hooking up with a guy at a conference and we had unprotected sex. I have never been so reckless before. I have had hookups before between relationships that I was not proud of, but they happened. This hookup gave me an HIV scare and when I talked to my family about it, they shamed me rather than try and support me through it. I should have used protection and not been so reckless. It upsets me to think what could have happened.

&#x200B;

After the conference and the one-night, we were friends on Facebook. He had connections at the time for jobs and I was looking for a job that year. My boyfriend found comments I had made on this guys Facebook. When confronted, I said that I never did that and that I would know if I had because I was mad at the guy (along those lines...i.e I should have known if I did). I thought this was true until my boyfriend said he had proof otherwise and said he saw me comment and like/heart photos. Thinking back, I do recall doing that but I wasn't doing it because I had any feelings or wanted any more from him. I should not have lied and simply told my boyfriend that I do not remember if I did. I should have never said something so certain like I would know if I did because I was so mad and disgusted at him. If I was not sure, which I was not, I should have been clear rather than lie. My boyfriend is upset about this situation too because there is a double standard. He had something similar happen where he had an ex on Facebook as a connection for work but removed him. I was upset he did that but at the same time, I did the same thing. There was a double standard and that was messed up. I gaslit and triangulated during this argument.

&#x200B;

Another instance happened pertaining to this hookup and I lied about it. My boyfriend asked if that guy and I chatted and I said ""no, we only chatted on the dating app"" (similar to that). The truth is at the time, I forgot we also texted. In all of my heart when he asked, I thought we had only texted on the dating app. A few days after, I was deleting all of my texts on my phone because I keep everything on my phone (another topic). It was here where I saw my messages with that guy from the time of the conference over a year ago (almost two now). I realized that I had lied when I saw it. My heart sank. I deleted it. Later, I told my boyfriend that I had deleted them and we got into an argument because I told him before all of this that we never texted. I insisted that I told him we messaged and that he should have figured that included texting. But the truth was I told him ""no, we only texted on the app"". In the argument, it got to a point where I accepted what he thought was the truth even though I know it was not. I did not know I texted him until after the fact when I went though my messages. He believed that I knew about the texts during the initial conversation and in an effort to end the argument so we could work on this, I validated what he believed even though it was not the truth. I gaslit during this argument.

&#x200B;

Now, something else has come up. I feel he believes it is a double standard. During one of my longest relationships (in fact, my longest one), we went through breakups and would get back together. During the time between breakups, I would hookup in college. I told my boyfriend that I had hookups in college but I never went into depth about the long relationship and it being on and off again multiple times. He had shared me with that he took a break from a guy and messed around. When he told me that, I assumed by taking a break it meant that they were still a couple, but just taking a break...I figured it was infidelity and cheating. I did not think to ask or clarify what taking a break meant because I assumed what I just said. So I never expressed what had happened with me because I thought they were separate. Having talked though last night, he clarified that a break meant things were over so it was similar to my situation. I thought in my mind what our histories were were not the same until last night and we talked.

&#x200B;

He is now upset because he wants to know a specific number of guys I have been with hooking up in college. I know for sure it is more than 5 (i remember these well) but less than 10. I think somewhere around 6-8, but I really do not know. He thinks I am lying about that and finds it hard to believe that I cannot give a number. It's the truth. There were some guys I did not know if we had sex because in all of my heard, I do not remember (drinking was involved but never drugs) and I honestly cannot give a definitive number. He does not accept this and will not accept this. I cannot give him a 100% answer on a specific number because I do not know. I wish I could satisfy his curiosity but I cannot. I told him that in the past, I have not been completely honest about the count to guys. It's true. Normally, my past relationships never come up. I told my boyfriend that I was on and off again with about the hookups but he did not care, so I only told him it happened and stopped giving numbers.

&#x200B;

There are other things in our relationship too that I have done not to be cruel but happened. I am working on those issues and I could elaborate more if it helps with this thread.

&#x200B;

My past self does not define me. I am not cheating on my boyfriend, I would never do that. I lied about a very specific hookup that brought me shame. I am not justifying that it was okay to lie, I hate that I did it. I am completely in the wrong and I wish I could have just been upfront from the getgo. I understand he is hurting and I am so sorry for all of this. I feel like everything I do now or have said in the past he thinks I lied about. He finds it hard to believe things now. I love him so much and I do have an issue with this hookup and my internalized guilt from it, but everything else in our relationship is real. I would go to the moon and back for him. I have given up things I like to do to spend time with him. I suggested and am committed to going to Therapy (couples and individual). He has things like the BPD to work on and I have to work on this lying (along with the gaslighting and other things we discussed early on) when I talk to him about this hookup. It hurts me because when I am trying to talk to him now, I think all he can think about is me lying.

&#x200B;

He has told me that I have narcissistic traits and have cluster-b characteristics. He told me that he had dated narcs in the past and has projected some of that onto me. In all of my therapy, this never came up. Part of me wonders if he is painting me as something I am not and is still projecting fears onto us.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This was a lot and not the entire relationship. We had a lot of good in there, it is these lies. We are in this limbo now. I sincerely love him and I want to work on my problems for myself. I 100% trust him and I am so sorry for hurting his trust and putting doubt in his mind. I do not want to breakup. I believe I can work on myself.

Something I've noticed is that I will assume other people hate me before entering a lot of social situations. It's like self-sabotage - protecting myself from rejection by pushing people away. I feel like a terrible person inside because of the shame of being a bad friend to others in the past. Because of this, I assume everyone hates me before I enter a social situation (even w/ strangers sometimes). Then I act awkward or distant or even rude without meaning to be & I rub people the wrong way, and they do actually dislike me. Then, I feel so ashamed about it, figure I've ruined everything, and try not to bother them anymore.

I believe that I'll only ever experience misery and suffering and that I'm not worthy of anything more, so I flaunt my stupidity around and wear it like a badge of honour. I exaggerate my suffering and will boast about real failures in my life such as not graduating high school on time and not wanting to work because I'm too stupid for a job.

That's what I thought. That's how I felt.

Of course I likely felt that way because I wasn't personally the object of praise. However nowadays, I know that other people are working towards goals. I understand that people suffer setbacks. They overcome things. None of this incorporates me. And I can understand that they can feel elated about finally getting what they want. I know that other people appreciate positive reinforcement.

But god help me if I'm supposed to celebrate or positively reinforce.

I have observed other people do these verbal celebrations. And I have been able to recycle the reactions in similar situations. But I feel like there's a core of genuineness that's missing. I feel like a fraud here. And I legitimately don't want to be.

I can somewhat do it here because I have the time to engage and compute through cognitive empathy. But social interactions are hell. And if it's a new situation that I haven't rehearsed, I know that my face goes blank as I search for the appropriate response."

I have become increasingly concerned that I am projecting the 'narcissist/abuser' label onto my ex, in order to deny my own manipulative behavior. My ex has been obsessed with me for 7+ years. I have been obsessed with him too but have been trying to move on because I'm in a relationship. We have both behaved badly. I have posted about it [previously on this subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/j1g0zn/confession_of_my_abusive_behavior_idealize/) as well as in plenty of other places. He always ends up coming across as an abusive person.

I feel like I'm trying to gain *understanding*, but recently I've been thinking thatactually I'm just doing this as a form of reassurance seeking and also a way to formulate a coherent narrative in my head. Then I post it on Reddit and get lots of validation from people saying I'm a victim/abused/codependent etc when in fact I have actively encouraged my ex's obsession with me. I have done this by not saying *no* emphatically enough, not blocking him when I went 'no contact' (which he would see as 'ghosting') and because somewhere deep down I do actually still have a fantasy of us getting together. I have let my boundaries down with him. I tend to frame it as him manipulating me to get my boundaries down, but maybe I have done this unconsciously to keep him around as a source of narcissistic supply. 

I certainly do seem to have this primal fear of 'losing' him (it comes up in dreams a lot).  I also note that when he called me out on my behavior (lying, contradictory statements/gaslighting) I went into a full-on depression/narcissistic collapse which resulted in me self-harming, being very passive aggressive towards him, and blaming myself when. I was angry at him because I felt 'how dare he accuse me of being manipulative when he is the bad one' (i.e. denial). Once I could formulate a narrative of him being the abuser and 'stand up' to him, I felt like a weight had been lifted (i.e. me feeling morally superior). This all looks very narcissistic to me. Perhaps, as he says, framing him as an abuser is all just an elaborate act to deny my feelings for him because acknowledging them would mean destroying the life I've built with my SO."

They saw that my character/personality/attitude/self construct/mindset had been damaged so as a spoiled person who never learned how to defend myself from harm they would use several manipulation tactics to belittle me. They would try to convince me that ONLY their words mattered to blind me from their actions but I saw their actions I may be spoiled but I finally see through that fucking bullshit although I was a bit gossipy as a teenager they would cheat,manipulate,put down,coerce,ignore,abandon,ruin,and etc to those who were mentally ill or insecure and I cannot believe I spoiled those peers by tolerating their behaviors (which was way worse than my behaviors as a child) because they would just demand for more love and appreciation so lesson here is just because someone is narcissistic or narcissistic related doesn't mean they are invulnerable to abuse from others similar or different to them."

After years of no contact she has started testing boundaries again. First she began texting her ex husband (my FIL) with very strangely worded congratulatory messages about becoming a grandpa... I can't remember exactly what her words were but she said something like ""this is great news for people who care about them"" (huh?).

A few weeks passed and she started texting my husband (her son) from different phone numbers. She didn't mention the baby, she messaged him sports news. He did not text back. Years of silence prior made this communication almost commicly idiotic.

Then a package of (honestly pretty crummy) baby gifts arrived. No card, no kind words, just a package with her PO box on the label. It is clear to me this gift was sent as a way of flexing that she knows our new address, and is aware of the new baby. I wish I had just sent the package back return to sender, but I guess my curiosity got the best of me. I opened it, and actually threw away every gift because I do not want her to ever see a photo of my baby with a toy and think she contributed in any way.

A few days later, another unexpected and unwanted package arrived for my husband's birthday and then another with a baby gift. This time the gift had no sender noted, the gift had been ordered from Etsy and sent directly to me. I threw it away.

Apparently more gifts arrived in the following weeks which my husband threw away without ever opening them or notifying me because he knew it would upset me. He called his mother and left her a voicemail telling her sternly that to stop sending gifts to our home and that they are not well received.

My FIL (who has been divorced from the narcissist for over 20 years and remarried a lovely sweet woman) came to my home and told me that his crazy ex-wife sent him the stern voicemail from her son. She is playing a victim to her ex-husband who doesn't want her in his life at all.

The voicemail seemed to have worked, and there was no contact again for a month or so.

I am extremely scared she will show up in our lives now that there is a baby. She was involved in a custody battle with my husband's cousins and fought hard to have a father's children taken away from him. She was involved in claiming abuse that never happened. It is important to me that she never meet my child, and never has an opportunity to inflict the emotional abusive behavior she used on her own 2 sons towards us (eespecially the baby).

\--

I decided to post on this form as a way to seek help, but also to document her behavior going forward for my own records. I have trouble keeping track of time since this has been ongoing for years.

Yesterday was Christmas. We kept our Christmas plans smaller than usual because of Covid19, and only dropped by 2 houses for our baby to see his grandparents (they're in our pandemic pod of the only people we visit). When opening up gifts at my parent's home it was revealed that my MIL had stopped by on Christmas eve and dropped off 2 gifts for the baby.

It's worth noting that my parents have only met her a handful of times over my 2 decade long relationship with my husband. It is very strange that she would ever go to their home, and they didn't even recognize her when she did show up. According to my mother she left the gifts and had to run, but I am not 100% confident that is the truth.

My parents text me what they eat for dinner every night, and every piece of gossip about their friends (even the ones I don't know). It's unlike my own mother not to share every detail of every day. So the fact that she didn't tell me on Christmas Eve as soon as the MIL left leaves me feeling sick that my mother isn't giving me the whole truth, and that my parents are being drawn into a web of manipulation.

I don't know what she will do next. I am scared for my family that she will continue to keep coming for us. Since sending gifts isn't in itself considered a threat, I can't take a restraining order.

I just want her to leave us alone forever.

Every member of my husband's family, including her own mother and brother have horror stories about her. She has ruined lives, she has sued multiple family members, she has stolen money, she has hit people, she has been arrested, and is eventually hated by every single person who has ever met her.

What can I do to end communication with a narc MIL?"

I moved around most my life and never got to make friends, changing schools sometimes 3 times a year, always got in trouble for either being disrespectful not paying attention, fights or just about anything anyone can get in trouble for in school I craved attention and put all my efforts into being a class clown a lot of times cracking jokes at my own expense (never minded it a person who cant laugh at themselves isn't secure in themselves), however regardless of how much of a fucking funny and ""charming"" I failed at making real intimate friendships where I felt loved and loved unconditionally, freely instead I was rejected, tho they laughed at my jokes they were never my friends instead they hated me and shunned me, they bulled me and I had to toughen up mentally I was the ""annoying"" kid all my life, I never stopped being and doing whatever I wanted to do and never will all I wanna be able to do is have a few trusting and good, intimate friends and thats where I get scared cuz I had them but I pissed them away utterly manipulated one of them a person who only ever wanted the best for me and thats something that I still struggle to cope with that monumental mistake, the other person I pissed away all cuz I didn't agree with a certain few ideological ideas of theirs, like that ever matters in a friendship, not to mention the 2 girls that loved one I cheated on, the other grabbed ass and dipped.

Now in quarantine I've come to the sad realization that I barely have anyone who gives a shit about me, had trouble with the realization that I actually did wrong to the people who never wanted to hurt me and have broken down multiple times the past few days , constantly reanalyzing my thoughts with the fear that I'm truly incable of feeling empathy, my father certainly cant and he has no friends or anyone who gives 2 shits about him, so much so he has clearly told me love doesn't exist and its a lie, I'm stuck out here living with him for the next 6 months at least and feel like I might turn like him."

This is a completely alien idea to me.

The worst consistent thing I have ever posed to myself is the phrase ""what is wrong with me?"" when I spent years trying to figure out what condition(s) my brain was dancing to. And I just couldn't figure it out. I was angry at myself because I should have been able to figure it out. But I never said anything like ""wow. You must be stupid."" And now that I know, I've even stopped asking that question. There's nothing wrong with me. I have a personality disorder. I have had another personality disorder. And these things are fixable with consistent effort over years.

But some other people wake up and go to bed saying shit like ""still fat. Stupid. Lump of crap. Worthless. Ugly. etc."" And like... Damn.

Don't get me wrong. I have said some bad things about myself to myself. But they're usually one-off things. And in the past I was quite skilled at externalizing any fault I had in any situation. But even when I did start taking responsibility for the things I fucked up, I have never ruminated on it. Or thought that I was ""stupid yet again."" I've always moved onto ""Okay. How can we fix or salvage this situation?""

I'm actually perplexed by this because negative self-talk seems especially common for people with BPD. But I got nothing. I'm wondering if narcissism saved me from that kind of self-shaming.

Do you guys experience negative self-talk?

In addition to the question, help other people fight their negative self-talk. I think we got plenty of positive self-talk to share it with others, whether it's compensatory or true. That's what a good person would do.

And now that I've written this out, I've realized that I have agreed with other people's negative self-talk that they've vocalized. Damn. Don't let others talk badly about themselves without challenging it.

It's definitely better that I know about my narcissistic personality but in my trial to get better and heal I am lost. Lost in life. Lost in everything.

I’ve always listened to my intuition about people and relationships as if it’s coming from the Gods and I’m quick to end things based off of that even though I know I’m not always right, but it’s always been to have control or to protect myself. 

Just wondering if this is common. I have not yet been diagnosed with NPD but I relate to all of the common traits and people close to me think so too."

I have bpd and ik how scary it can be to get help and leave behind behaviors that have ""protected"" you for your whole life. but the world opens up when your realize there is life without constant pain. I can imagine the heavy stigma that must come along with npd because narcissistic is used in a very negative way. but I see you and I know you arent all bad, we all have flaws and bad things but there is so much good too. and i just wanted to say i see and hear you and hope that all of you know  recovery and treatment is possible. you just gotta let it in.

I cannot deny... as an e-ThOt In ReCoVeRy... Being validated by large numbers of people on social media platforms DOES provide some validation, at least enough to hype me up for the rest of that day. It feels nice to be recognized... Even if it's just a picture of my face that a bunch of strangers appreciated. Self-love is easier to come by when you can see others throwing their ""superficialist"" love your way

Here he is being interviewed about his most recent loss on season 20. He claims that he played a great game and he will never change the way he plays because his game play is not the reason he lost but the way the game is set up. The consensus is that he did not play a great game and lacked in many areas. 

I already know he is narcissistic but do you believe his narcissism rises up to the level of a diagnosis of npd? It’s obviously not healthy narcissism as he refuses to better him and take account for his poor play. If you do believe his narcissism rises to the level of a diagnosis do you think he has severe narcissism or just narcissistic traits?

khdnwf,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/khdnwf/get_over_it/,“Get over it”,5,0,1608541248.0,"Hello readers :) I’m new to this sub & this happens to be my first ( probably last ) post.. 

I’m [22M] and I live in sunny South Africa. I don’t have any form of tertiary education, so forgive, what may seem like empty statements with no real context. I’m still trying to figure myself out and where I want to be. Hope I elaborate well enough. 

Anyway. I’ve grown up in a “relatively” rough setting, dad cheated on mom when I was 5 and it’s been my younger brother, my mom and myself for the better part of 17 years. Times were tough, especially for my mom who had to raise two boys by herself in big bad Johannesburg. I’ve grown up to believe that it’s me vs the world, I try to be as independent as I possibly can to less the stress on my mom’s shoulders. As a result of of this, I’ve developed a sort of “god complex” in the sense that I’m capable of anything (as human beings, we are generally really capable of anything) I’m really open minded, while standing firm by my morales; which are a questionable here and there. Yet I feel as if there aren’t many people who can relate to me, or struggle to see the bigger picture for the most parts. I know I’m on this rock to do great things, I have an average IQ of 140 ( which I know doesn’t typically tell you the type of person you are ) but regardless, I want to help people and bring them together; almost like I’m the missing piece in some sociopolitical puzzle. 

It’s a bit overwhelming to say the least, being this age, at this point in time, in my current setting (South Africa) I’m very much aware of myself and my place among my peers, although I do think to myself that I’m supposed to be more and be further in life. Which brings me to the title, “get over it”. All my life, when things don’t necessarily go my way, or I face strife, the nuance has kinda been that I need to pick myself up and get on with it; without really facing the real problem and just sort of brushing it off and moving forward. This has resulted in a lot of unresolved problems, which has led to serious anxiety, depression and overall doubt in self, when I’m unable to fully deal with something out of my control. When this happens, I usually turn to humor to get me through it. I laugh at my own jokes and tend to always try and see the brighter side, in doing so, I also help others who have similar problems by making them smile and kinda forget about it. As I get older, the more “serious” side of me is trying to make an escape into the big bad world, which I don’t necessarily understand. I see my small group of friends and where they’re going and I look at myself and think “Well fuck, they’re at X, why aren’t I there yet” I know it’s bad to compare yourself to others, since everyone always has their own story to tell. I just know that me personally, being capable of so many things, should be somehow be further. Now, like I said, being in SA, finance is in ruin, black vs white [I’m white] it can all be overwhelming from a realist POV. I’m still cautiously optimistic, perhaps even unjustifiably naive when I say that I can bring people together. My main focus used to be animals, but I realized that the animal that needs the most focus/help is Homo Sapien. Now anybody could try solve the world hunger crisis, or help refugees in their free time, but I like to think that I can change the mindset from “Me me me” to “We we we” - no humor intended. 


It’s just a little harder sometimes to stay true to your values, to be the person that people see me as. A lot of my peers, close friends & family have said that they can see me helping people; which I don’t necessarily disagree with because I genuinely like helping others, as much as I like helping myself. It may not always be from a narcissistic stand point, but I definitely enjoy the attention, although I don’t like to portray that I enjoy the attention. I guess I just really want to find a way in which I can hide my true self motivation, without letting others see me as this “I’m better than you in the way I perceive everything” kinda mindset. It’s tough. It really is. 


But yeah, I know this post doesn’t really hold any value out on the World Wide Web. It still feels good to externalize what I’ve been thinking for a while. On the small chance that I end up at a conference at the UN one day, I’ll be sure to make narcissism a known factor in the ways that we see others and ourselves. How it drives the reptilian part of our brain to survive and look out for numero uno."

My Facebook NPD Mixed-Chat page seems to have a very mixed opinion. 

As an NPD, I've realized that I am overly conscious & devoted to the ""superiority"" of my own sexual performance. (like... it's almost insulting of someone doesn't tell me I'm the best they've ever had) I feel like it's yet another part of life that requires a ""performance,"" on my end... &, Putting all of my focus on my partner's pleasure, because.... That post-coitus validation is almost even more pleasurable than physically seeing someone react to what I do, itself. 

AT THE SAME TIME. The best dick I've ever had was from my Narcissistic ex.  I'm worried I will spend the rest of my existence having nightmares about how he successfully can steal someone's soul, just filling up their holes. 

(Now, I'm all for ending societal stigmatization targeted toward narcissists... But, I have to recognize that stereotypes exist for a reason. He was definitely an NPD that has helped promote the idea that all narcissists are spawns of Satan...& I'm worried my existence will be spent salty about the fact that this literal demon disguised in human flesh is just roaming the Earth, with that devil dick. 🙄)

Some of the responses claimd that narcissists were extremely selfish lovers in the bedroom. Although that has never been my personal experience, I wanted to ask other NPD's how they perceived themselves, sexually, &, if they've had sexual relations with other narcissists, how exactly their performance chalked-up to be."

Discrimination and Abuse Against Narcissists,5,38,1608458483.0,"I have always found it profoundly interesting that among all of the diseases, disabilities, and disorders in the world, there are only two which remain widely acceptable to publicly berate and demonise: pedophilia and narcissism. The former in any external manifestation is a crime. The latter, however, is not always criminal in its manifestations but somehow always justifies any abuse toward a narcissist.

While it is considered cruel for someone overweight to be called fat, it is acceptable to say that narcissists are dangerous.

While it is considered cruel for someone with a learning disability to be called a retard, it is acceptable to say that narcissists are evil.

While it is considered cruel for someone with bipolar disorder to be called crazy, it is acceptable to say that narcissists are insane.

While it is considered cruel for someone with dwarfism to be called a midget, it is acceptable to say that narcissists are monsters.

The word ""narcissist"" is one of the few terms that remain scientifically relevant despite being used as a conventional insult for all of its medical history. Most of the time terms are shifted to protect the dignity of those affects, but not in the case of narcissism. If anything it has become more popular to attack them due to increased notoriety (Donald Trump was famously labeled an undiagnosed narcissist). Society seems unwilling to consider them afflicted but only as the afflicting, and not on a spectrum or specific category but black and white. You can say almost anywhere to almost anyone that narcissists are terrible human beings and it will be tolerated or reciprocated.

Will it always be acceptable to discriminate against and berate narcissists?

I don't have an official diagnosis, only a strong suspicion and a recent memory of a therapist who told me to look into Kohut's self psychology. Well, I did, my suspicions were strengthened, and I found myself here. 

I have a (10+ yrs) long-term partner that, following research, I have convinced myself has become a 'selfobject' to me. We took a separation a few months ago and during which time it felt like I was unraveling at my core. I experienced uncontrollable body shakes (starting at the base of my spine) and extreme undirected rage. It was a terrifying experience. I didn't know who to reach out to or how to articulate or make sense of my suffering. It felt unprovoked, it wasn't following a fight or triggered by anything specifically recognizable. I can only assume it was brought on by our separation, but I didn't even necessarily miss him - it simply felt like I was coming undone, losing my mind. I had a dream about a stone with air bubbles that was crumbling apart. I was in a horrible place and don't wish the experience on anyone, but I am interested to know whether anyone out there might be able to relate to it. Has anyone navigated this type of situation before? Made it out alive? Maybe even better for it?

LT mate and I are back together now, I've started taking medication, and thankfully most of my extreme anxiety symptoms have gone away.  BUT, for additional context, I should mention that I also almost lost him to a freak accident about a year and a half ago. This coupled with our recent near split has really put into perspective the reality that one day I won't  necessarily have him to lean on. Ideally, I'll find the strength to lean on myself while staying in my committed relationship. But I don't know how. Again, anyone who might relate, please reach out. It would be lovely to feel less alone in this. 

I hope this an appropriate post for this sub-reddit. I feel vulnerable and hope you'll be kind."
