ggzio78,t3_kjttrg,Oooh I use this line too! Not often but I've definitely said something similar.,t3_kjttrg
gh193cd,t3_kjttrg,"My armchair psychology take is that it's a harmless and acceptable outlet for sadism most people feel to some degree. I.e. its just a prank, bro. It doesn't take a narcissist to find joy in pranking people, but narcissists might be more attracted to this type of humor than average",t3_kjttrg
ggz0xo7,t1_ggyzwa8,You say that but my dads head perks up every time she walks by.. you want a women whose gonna bang your kids head into the floor? She’s all yours,t3_kjttrg
gh0mw78,t1_ggzio78,Haha why though,t3_kjttrg
gh20kkl,t1_gh193cd,Yeah my mom is a narcissist or something idk but there’s something wrong w her in general. I tested by seeing if asking for an apology and telling her I’d grown as a person would give her a narcissistic wound.. and sure enough she went insane. I just thought this joke of hers was weird so thought I’d ask,t3_kjttrg
gh0uqgx,t1_gh0mw78,Idk it's funny in my brainnnnnn lol,t3_kjttrg
gh3ku55,t1_gh20kkl,"If you don't mind me asking, what do you get out of analyzing the details of your mother's behavior? Have the things you've understood so far brought you a sense of closure?",t3_kjttrg
gh3qf7w,t1_gh3ku55,"Basically I want to understand what causes someone to act that way. Looking into If she could possibly be autistic or why she is the way she is so that I don’t end up like her. Even though her and I don’t have similar personalities being raised by someone like her gives me my own negative qualities that are important to work on so I don’t end up treating future relationships or children the way she treated me or toxic in anyway. So I can understand that she caused an anxiety disorder in me and so I can grow up without having her judge mental attitude where she believes she’s better than everyone. The only relationship she formed with me was based on shipping and watching television. She never made there be a sense of a real vulnerable, trusting relationship due to her humiliation and inability to act as a grown up.

I mean at times she seems autistic or just stupid. I had selective mutism in preschool and my mom had books about it and shy children.. she said she was going to drop the books off at a women’s house on her patio w out ringing the doorbell bc she had a shy son. Idk I think this is rude to give someone books about having a disordered child. Imagine walking outside and seeing books on your patio from an anonymous stranger pointing out they think ur child isn’t normal",t3_kjttrg
