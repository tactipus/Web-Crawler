gh1hz0f,t3_kjznx2,"I've been hurt by trying to love other people and now employ ultra-independence as a trauma response, the thread.

Maybe you truly believe this is a moral thing to do, maybe you don't, but you have to acknowledge that the ideal version of yourself would not have this pathological reaction to them, or desire any sort of victory over a category of the definitively mentally ill in general. Snapping your fingers Thanos-style to get rid of everyone with traits or the disorder would not fully resolve what damage has been done to you, and might also take with it a fair bit of your own persona unfortunately.

If you were raised by them, it is also no accident that you have dated them and sound like them. If you hate narcissism, make sure you extinguish the habits you have learned from narcissism, else you might propagate them to even more people.

Best of luck dude.",t3_kjznx2

gh1lkzx,t1_gh1iis3,"\>I fukkkn hate em.

This much is clear.

\>They deserve everything I do to them.

Are you 100% certain of this? You would be the first person who would be; you would need perfect moral authority and total information about the person you were doing it to, including what flow-on effects your actions had on other people through them, to back this up.

It's ok if this is a ""this is how I feel"" deal, and tell us what you like (we're anonymous internet strangers), but be honest with yourself.

\>They’re all scum who are subhuman

What other broad swathes of society are subhuman? How did they become subhuman? Can they be made human? What should be done with subhumans? Who would be best to do it?",t3_kjznx2

ggzwhp7,t1_ggzw3i0,Narcissists ruined my life. I’ve been returning the favor fir last three decades. Least I can do. Only getting better at it irl. They’re scum. I hate narcissists and Aspies. Both don’t belong in my zip code.,t3_kjznx2

ggztja3,t1_ggzqqb9,"Depends on the subject, with this one for example their are a lot of telltale signs. Narcissists who are introverted tend to hate other narcissists especially those who project their grandiose nature. Also sounds like you hold grudges and you intentionally use tactics to purposely hurt them to protect your own fragile complex. Sounds narcissistic if you ask me.",t3_kjznx2
ggzy4jp,t1_ggzwhp7,"People do things everyday to feel better about themselves, whether or not they realize or acknowledge the fact that sometimes others get hurt in some capacity by their actions doesn't change the fact that it happens.

I guess if you're going to do something, do it right I suppose.",t3_kjznx2
gh095zr,t1_gh08znl,"Who says I am one.

Real talk, buddy. You sound very sick and like you truly need help. I sincerely encourage you to find some. There are likely free or reduced cost community mental health services near you. If you tell me where you’re located I will help find some for you. 

Life isn’t supposed to be this painful and full of hate & anger.",t3_kjznx2
ggzu63l,t1_ggzpa32,Seems like fixing your own life should take priority over messing with other people. Don’t worry about narcissists. We’re around 1% of the population and we harm ourselves even more than we hurt others.,t3_kjznx2
