ggor5ry,t3_ki4l4g,"I think it is possible. On my therapy I learn how not to disconnect feelings from others as well as from myself. I mean I learn how to accept my more vulnerable parts and emotions and let myself show/feel them. I don’t know if I want to have full emotional empathy though. On the one hand it’d help me to connect more with others, be more wholehearted, but on the other it is sometimes easier to help someone without feeling too strong emotions. But yeah, it is hard for me for now to show my fiancé compassion with his dying mother and I’d really like to help him. So I learn",t3_ki4l4g
ggpc772,t3_ki4l4g,"I did feel affective empathy for my last ex. And it's so much fucking easier. But it's also more unpleasant since you actually experience the negative emotions. So, yes. With enough self-work it can happen. And this was before I ever went to therapy.

It really does work differently. You really feel what they feel. You really want to help them feel better. And *you don't have to understand the reason why they're upset* (I know that sounds crazy).

Now, I have to say that I still have to exert cognitive empathy with just about everyone else. I still have to will myself to care about most people.

How? Why? God, that was after my narc crash. But apparently it was something about her since I still have to work for everyone else. I have posted three Unsent Letters to her, if you care to check those out.

One of the things I did differently with her was *accept* her. What I would have previously viewed as deficits or flaws, I just adopted an attitude of ""whatever."" I didn't just straight discard. I didn't adopt a mentality of ""we can fix this."" I also wasn't hung up if she didn't want to do things I wanted to do or if she wasn't interested in things I was interested in.

I also learned that I could trust her in a way that I hadn't anyone else before. She would never say *anything* with an ill-will. Like she could say cruel things, but she was saying them for the comedic value. She really had no desire to criticize, blame, embarrass, shame, guilt, or ridicule. So, I felt safe. And honestly that was a unique feeling. I would say that I have loved two other women (although my behavior definitely didn't reflect that), but I didn't feel as safe during either of those relationships.

Maybe we get it with real self-esteem. When we always feel safe in ourselves.",t3_ki4l4g
ggpyr5g,t3_ki4l4g,The way I view empathy is mostly in relation to brutal murder and torture (I know this sounds bad but hear me out)... I have a hard time feeling empathy for things that don’t scare the fuck out of me. But if I hear a story about someone’s murder I can put myself in their shoes and feel their pain and get angry on their behalf but it’s only because I fear that shit.  I’m not sure how to have empathy for things that I personally don’t fear however....,t3_ki4l4g

ggw1vve,t3_ki4l4g,"Healthy empathic functioning involves a dialectical interplay between cognitive and emotional aspects of empathic understandings of others. In order to be able to feel for other people, though, my sense of it having read a bunch of psychoanalytic theory about these things (though not quite specifically about your question) is that in order to be able to accept and understand others' feelings, you need to understand your own difficulties with feeling things. Especially painful and negative emotions that you might be cutting yourself off from. 

This is often the source of difficulty with feeling anything in the first place, which I think is also where difficulties with empathic understanding of others can come from. It's hard to feel anything for other people if you won't even let yourself feel things for yourself, that you want to flee from (things that were traumatic due to some combination of actually bad experiences in very early life (age 0-4) and/or an especially sensitive temperament - this varies from person to person. Borderline and Avoidant types seem to tend to have more sensitive temperaments than those with NPD, but I don't think there's any statistical data to support this, it is just something I've read a few different very experienced therapists say (Nancy McWilliams and Marsha Linehan).)

This can get tricky and complicated because it's difficult to sort out what is a projection of inner psychic reality and what is real memory and accurate characterization of parents who probably were on some level abusive and/or negligent, but perhaps not as much as we feel that they were. It's a common observation by various therapists who write about these PDs that, where it is possible to check a patient's recollections against the facts, often the internal representations of the parents as bad and persecutory have some elements of distortion in them. On the other hand this is not always the case. And this can also take the form of idealization such that an abusive parent is remembered as good because one can't bear to think of them as being in any way bad.

Since that stuff can be confusing, and since often there's a lot of amnesia around it, that is partly why a therapist can be so helpful, particularly psychoanalytically oriented ones. It's within the transference-countertransference that you'll be able to discover and unpack the dynamics that go into whatever traumatic relational configurations (sometimes termed enactments) that you might be unknowingly preventing yourself from thinking or feeling about. A crucial part of such a process would be the identification and then the working-through of painful affects involved in whatever conflicts you may have had with significant others in early life. This leads to a generally greater ability to have one's own feelings, which is the basis on which we come to understand how others are feeling.

The other benefit of this kind of work is that it means that the narcissistic or otherwise PD'd patient will have less of a need to project the bad feelings they don't want to feel outwardly into others. When one is projecting bad feelings out (and introjecting the other's good aspects a lot, as in, for example, taking credit for something someone else did, or imagining one has good qualities that one covets in the other), it's very difficult if not impossible to really empathize with that other person/people.

It should be noted also that it might help to think of what people call emotional empathy as sympathy and caring for others (not sympathy as in pity). Sympathy involves caring about others, not just understanding them, and that's a key aspect of what's too often mis-termed as emotional empathy, which is more about understanding than it is about care.",t3_ki4l4g
ggsj22v,t3_ki4l4g,I've been practicing empathy for some years now and I think it does get easier. I feel like cognitive empathy can turn into emotional empathy.,t3_ki4l4g
