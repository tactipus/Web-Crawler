ggryuoo,t3_kihbko,"It's a very common NPD thing to do - leave them before they leave you, try to avoid the crushing pain of heart break. 

Stick through it. It took me about 6 months or so with my partner before my fears died down. You'll do great.",t3_kihbko
ggsb14q,t3_kihbko,It’s certainly common of people with Cluster B traits. Connection and control are very different as you’ve pointed out. I would argue that reaching one requires letting go of the other.,t3_kihbko
ggr4l1p,t3_kihbko,"NPD Does not allow you to love someone.
You love her services her love and care but you don't really have deep emotions.
Basically its ""I love me"" kind of situation.

You invest in so much emotion to 5 times more emotions.
While you stay quite with silenttreatement.

Ofcourse until you aee self aware",t3_kihbko

ggryl9c,t1_ggr4l1p,This is false and very hurtful. What are you doing on the npd support sub?,t3_kihbko
ggsj3x4,t1_ggs2bul,"So narcissism is a spectrum, with unhealthy defence mechanisms at one end and full blown malignant npd at the other. The main difference between one end of the spectrum and the other is the ability to feel empathy. That said, people can still be capable of empathy and love at the NPD end, even if they aren’t necessarily feeling it fully in the moment - particularly early in recovery. Also, you do get classic narcissists but some of us have traits across cluster b (empathy dysfunction is a core issue for most of these). From what you are saying, you could be pushing people away to avoid intimacy or you could be trusting your gut and making the right call. If you are consistently ending relationships as a result of this, maybe you are subconsciously choosing partners you know it won’t work with to avoid actual depth and feeling in relationships?",t3_kihbko
ggs36tu,t1_ggs2bul,"I never said Don't try. Its not permanent 
I i just felt like clarifying the issue.
Because NPD people are barley active.",t3_kihbko
ggs32dv,t1_ggs2bul,"They can love if they change I am not saying its impossible. What I mean non self aware ones can't love.
I am not hating you I am just clarifying the issue.

Since no NPD answered.
We empath suffer the same damage the npd do to them self. 

I just helped you reliaze what the issue is.",t3_kihbko

ggrz1i2,t1_ggryvz9,"Thanks for an article that's really great. Let me just see if there's any data there - no, sorry. Please stop demonising mentally ill people. This isn't a sub for you.",t3_kihbko
ggs4372,t1_ggs3lpg,"I just want to give you information instead of waiting for NPD Person to respond. I never meant to trigger you or something.

My response was right because I studied my friend's behavior. He hoovers the exact people he needs,
He hoovers me when they are bored or disappear.
I also read many Doctors sayings.

Believe me we empath suffers way more than you
At least you are not the Primary victim.
Uou are a victim of your mind. Our mood is based on yours",t3_kihbko

ggs6xqz,t1_ggs53lr,"I mean if you want to change, you will change.
You won't be a naracist for sure. Naraciam can be healed.
The biggest reason there is that you are self aware.
Many people don't realize naracism is self destruction",t3_kihbko
ggsarnz,t1_ggs13rs,"It is simply not true that someone with NPD cannot love someone that’s ridiculous to be quite honest, even psychopaths can have love.  ANY human being is capable of love to some extent.  Please stop spreading internet propaganda as if it were facts especially on a NPD forum.  

Do you have any idea how it would feel towards someone who struggles to make connections to people and is trying to hear that?  Probably just give up right?  This isn’t the place for that, pwNPD are damaged and because of that damage struggle to connect with people it’s not impossible it requires some healing and maturing but nothing is impossible that word if for small minds to begin with.",t3_kihbko
ggtb6yg,t1_ggs6xqz,"Okay buddy, spell it with me. N-A-R-C-I-S-S-I-S-T. Or NARCISSISM. or NARCISSISTIC. 

NARACIST is not a word. It means nothing.",t3_kihbko
ggsereu,t1_ggsarnz,Couldn't agree more.,t3_kihbko
ggz9hx7,t1_ggsarnz,"NPDers can't love until they get better, I think that is all they were saying even though they said it poorly. And that view happens to be accurate and accords with psychoanalytic views on this issue generally. Narcissism is kind of definitionally an inability to love. Splitting, projective identification and denial make it impossible to see the other (or indeed, even oneself) as a person in their own right, and such seeing is an integral first step toward the possibility of loving.

I don't think narcissism is really on a spectrum, exactly, either. I think there are different gradations but I also think it's possible to ""wake up"" out of it and begin to see oneself acting selfishly and hurtfully and to realize that work needs to be done to right past wrongs and to prevent further ones. And that process is something like a kind of a conversion, out of narcissism and into object love (to use the Freudian language. The Kleinians speak of moving from the paranoid-schizoid to the depressive position). This is a categorical difference, it isn't a slow and gradual shift of the quantitative sort. A big part of that shift is often in the form of revisiting the unconscious choice to evade early life pain and to base one's life on the bearing of that pain rather than the continuing evasion of it. A good psychotherapy involves what is often termed the working through of such painful affects as were experienced around early attachment disruptions, which led to the need for the creation of a narcissistic defensive pathological organization of the personality in the first place.",t3_kihbko
