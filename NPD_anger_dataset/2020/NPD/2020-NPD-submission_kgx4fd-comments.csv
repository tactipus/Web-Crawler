ggi4k9w,t3_kgx4fd,"I don’t think so although we probably all think so.  The disordered females I’ve been with tended to have hang ups and weren’t really able to open up and trust.  That said it depends on what you are into I have a sadomasochist streak in me and in my opinion PwPD are more likely to live out traumas during sex like rough behavior, choking, domination and live out rape fantasies etc.  so I have a strong pull to this type of sex where it’s more about power and back and forth struggles as opposed to being close and tender and loving.  Which really does nothing for me",t3_kgx4fd
gghu82f,t3_kgx4fd,"Only with other pwPDs, I guess? Those who only care about the sexual act, feelings aside. My ex and most mentally healthy people tend to like having sex with people they're emotionally connected with, and that's essentially what we lack in most cases. I've personally never experienced that emotional or sexual connection with anyone. 

I relate to focusing solely on the other person's pleasure so we can get the validation, I do it too. But I people please in other areas of life as well.",t3_kgx4fd
ggithp7,t3_kgx4fd,"Both my wife and I have Cluster B disorders, we can both honestly say it's the best sex we've ever had. Were into all sorts of crazy stuff 😅",t3_kgx4fd
ggi8k5d,t3_kgx4fd,"I don't understand that myth. Not to mention that ""better"" would need a reference to that everybody could compare their own experiences in a measurable way. 

If something was different then that I didn't feel connected.",t3_kgx4fd
ggilvvp,t3_kgx4fd,My current Narcissist boyfriend gives me an orgasm every time. He is so sweet in bed. It is honestly the only times I can guarantee we will get along and I will love him to pieces. Outside of bed he is an ass. I wish we could have sex twice a day so I was always in that high. Then I would never notice how often he is a jerk.,t3_kgx4fd
ggi09gj,t3_kgx4fd,I've always gotten tremendous feedback except from my NPD ex lol,t3_kgx4fd
ggi2kar,t3_kgx4fd,If they’re covert and really self loathing... yeah,t3_kgx4fd
ggj16ff,t3_kgx4fd,I used to do my absolute best every single time when having sex in my previous relationship to have control over her. Made her feel amazing and good enough she would always want to return a favor. Having said that I’m not proud of it I’m just explaining it as it is.,t3_kgx4fd
ggjan8y,t3_kgx4fd,My ex with npd was super boring in bed. Half the time I want able to even do shit that is considered to be normal. She was a total deadfish and when she wasn't agreed work for like 5 minutes of the 2 hours of me fucking her.,t3_kgx4fd
ggpgkl1,t3_kgx4fd," > He was definitely an NPD that has helped promote the idea that all narcissists are spawns of Satan...& I'm worried my existence will be spent salty about the fact that this literal demon disguised in human flesh is just roaming the Earth, with that devil dick. 🙄

You dated my ex bf I see. Lol",t3_kgx4fd
gjozz59,t3_kgx4fd,"So I’m not sure about NPDs but I think borderlines definitely are. They’re people pleasers at their core, for some reason most start being promiscuous at a young age, and by the time they’re in their mid20s they not only have a reputation for “getting around” but they have also developed a skill. Skill set I should say. Plus it fits with the criteria of impulsivity in at lea 2 areas (overspending, drug abuse, reckless driving, unsafe sex, etc) and since BPDs generally have low self worth, they will feel validated by being good at what they do. It will make them feel as if they have worth. Ya know? 
I myself haven’t noticed a pattern. I honestly haven’t been in too many actual long term relationships, but in all of them I was better in bed 🤷🏻‍♀️ totally not rooting my own horn, it is what it is though. My last 2 exes told me, one was 40 the next 32; that they’d never experienced certain things or done certain activities before I came along. Not the first time I’ve heard that either from grown men. Like getting off from just receiving head. Like huh?! The women you been with obviously didn’t know what they were doing then is what I’d say. But maybe us cluster Bs are just better at sexual activities 🤷🏻‍♀️",t3_kgx4fd
ggiq3zd,t3_kgx4fd,I feel like toxic people are always better in bed cuz usually they’re the ones having lot’s of sex (for validation etc.) so they practice lmao,t3_kgx4fd
ggiy6bc,t3_kgx4fd,Nope ... lack interest in making someone else feel good,t3_kgx4fd
ggjcrdc,t3_kgx4fd,my narcissistic/BPD-esque ex loooved sex but never learned anything other than pumping.. over four years. loved that person as a human being but as a sexual partner I was just a pocket pussy,t3_kgx4fd
ggqfz69,t3_kgx4fd,"BPD with narcissistic traits and I'm fabulous in bed, and surprisingly not a sex-addict. I avoided sex in my youth out of fear.",t3_kgx4fd
gh40wel,t3_kgx4fd,"Two of the narcissist I’ve dated were some of the best lovers ~ I think you have a point there. However, now these memories are quite rained with how I remember the other aspects of the relationship.",t3_kgx4fd
ggi5vt6,t3_kgx4fd,I am convinced that I was the best fucker my exes had to this day,t3_kgx4fd
ggkuwb3,t3_kgx4fd,Only one way to find out.,t3_kgx4fd
ggi8dp5,t3_kgx4fd,"No, they are not better in bed. They only care about their own needs and lack the connection needed to make sex good",t3_kgx4fd
ggi5t0o,t1_ggi4k9w,"Jfc. Is this why I can't get off, unless I'm being treated like the garbage that I am?! Why I can't make love, only fuck? 

....wow.

...Thank you for explaining why I am so dysfunctionally kinky. 🤔 😳",t3_kgx4fd
gghv9f9,t1_gghu82f,Thanks for the award /u/TheGiraffeEater it's my first one! <3,t3_kgx4fd
ggl14pm,t1_gghu82f,"I've not been diagnosed with NPD (and consider myself a more likely candidate for SPD) but I find your interpretation to be of personal interest due to a loose correlation to my personal experience which may help to identify my condition. This is going to be a bit revealing by my standards (I'm normally extremely private about my sex life) but I'm presently both anonymous and old enough to accept that others can know.

About 10 years ago I was an active sexual deviant with an infatuation with extreme levels of domination (actual rather than theatrical) and during that time I was probably far more capable of physically satisfying a partner than I am now. Anything resembling an emotional connection from my end was predicated on my practical benefit. Sex was a premeditated process of controlling their body as a heavy-handed break and entry to reliable access to their mental and emotional state, which was my fantasy. Everything was about me and what I wanted, which included pleasing my partner by means of seduction and the delivery of physical and emotional pleasure as, for the lack of a better term, bait.

The quality of sex may have had more to do with the selection process than anything, as I disqualified anyone who was not positive/susceptible to desires related to sexual submission and general subservience because I was not actively interested in ""breaking"" anyone who didn't quickly or immediately show signs of satisfaction from being objectified because I considered that to be predatory. Over time I came to recognise that what I allowed myself to do was still predatory as it became obvious over the course of a few partners that my interpretation of informed consent was a matter of convenience rather than genuine care, which is the only meaningful purpose of informed consent other than predators avoiding moral or criminal liability.

In fact, those experiences are primarily what make me suspect that I may have NPD. From the moment I had crafted a code of ethics which forbids me from predatory behaviour (even more restrictive than ordinary people, as I barely allow myself to flirt) the quality of my sex life for both myself and subsequent partners had declined dramatically to the extent that I would admit to not having much interest or pleasure anymore. I now prioritise the native emotional state and overall wellbeing of my partners to the extent that I am always actively conscious and cautious about how I affect them. I effectively traumatised myself by retroactively recognising my potential to be abusive *whether or not* it is interpreted by my partner as abuse. To this day I am uncertain if my past partners and I were simply sharing a fetish or if I was merely projecting in order to justify a fantasy that was inherently abusive, as I generally remained friends with most of them for some time after our relationship ended and was never explicitly labeled as abusive that I can recall. My suspicion is that my behaviour was a symptom of NPD and my partners were codependents that interpreted abuse as a form of affection, which I later came to understand is relatively common in abusive relationships.

If anyone with NPD can relate to this in any way I'd be interested in hearing about it. As it's been approximately a decade since that time, I find it difficult to make meaningful analysis yet the sharp decline in the quality of my sex life, which remains the case today. It makes me concerned that I cannot experience this ""emotional connection"" aspect that you refer to and therefore remain solely reliant upon thoroughly objectifying my partner during sex in the way that you had described to deliver and receive a greater significance of pleasure. It's not that sex has been unpleasant, just... rather boring. Seemingly no matter what we do in bed, nor how sexually submissive they happened to be. I can live with it, but I'd like to understand it better. Could it be because I have reframed sex in a way that excludes my true incentive, which is to objectify another human being for my own utility? Or have I merely become too self-conscious about myself, my partner, and sex in general to fully enjoy the experience?",t3_kgx4fd
ggi5zzh,t1_gghu82f,"Same here, and I only need a female ass.",t3_kgx4fd
ggix7g6,t1_ggithp7,"This is me and my wife, too, I am a covert narcissist, while she is Borderline. Add in that we are kindergarten 'sweethearts' and she is exactly my physical type, and it becomes understandable in the most terrible way why we stay together despite causing each other so much bullshit.",t3_kgx4fd
ggixi1n,t1_ggi8k5d,"Idk. Seems reasonable for a myth like that to start whenever someone sucks your dick with full intention to suffocate themselves, bc they're perfectly okay with no longer breathing😂",t3_kgx4fd
ggi30t3,t1_ggi2kar,"I guess that explains it. In my initial years of sexual activity, I really hated myself. (Might be being comorbid with BPD)",t3_kgx4fd
ggixn5f,t1_ggi8dp5,"That's crazy! I've gone my entire life without receiving oral sex in my relationships, & never even thought it was something I should expect. Idkkkk maybe that's also part of being a woman, feeling as if the sexual performance is based upon the man..? It's confusing it really is",t3_kgx4fd
ggi6wx1,t1_ggi5t0o,It’s just personal experience I’m sure it’s different for everyone.  I’d say as long as you like it and find someone else who likes the same thing you are going to be happy.  I’m at the point that I accept that I’m a real fucking weirdo in some ways sex being one of them but I don’t let other people make me feel like shit about it anymore I just accept it and just be open and honest about it with partners if they find it too strange for them they will do what the need to do but either I attract this type or more people are into it than I ever imagined,t3_kgx4fd
ggigble,t1_ggi5t0o,"Meh - only the people that get close enough can tell if your kink is dysfunctional or not, and once they get there is shouldn’t be a surprise to them anyway ;)

I also suspect us dysfunctional kinksters cover more ground in terms of how we play - things that other people would need psychological prep to do without damage I will rock right up for and emerge totally, or at least unidentifiably unscathed (thanks subspace, or a more honest term, sexual dissociation). I truly don’t feel like I’m missing out on anything in terms of my sexual self - kinda feel like its those that aren’t interested in exploring themselves sexually that miss out. Poor fuckers.",t3_kgx4fd

ggk5acr,t1_ggi30t3,"Yeah. People with Cluster B adaptations tend to seek validation/love through all sorts of coping mechanisms... humor, charisma, sex. It becomes a subconscious thing - what we perceive as an uptick in sex drive can actually be the desire to control another person.",t3_kgx4fd
