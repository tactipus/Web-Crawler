gh483xx,t3_kkscks,"Hey, you can absolutely be developing a personality disorder long before it's formally diagnosed. Before you get all freaked out, remember that as a kid, you don't have nearly the resouces you will when you are older. So whatever feels impossible now, it isn't. Find some help and advocate for yourself. It seems like you've got the ability to do that well if you put it into practice. 

From someone who has been there, the earlier you get a jump on this, the better! You will have a big head start if you do.

Don't push away your concerns or allow shallow words from others to be overly comforting. Challenge yourself to seek the truth! You don't want to be making the same inquiry of the wrong therapist at 25 and have them shut you down, only to have a repeat at 35, or god forbid 55, after you've caused destruction. Hold onto your moments of clarity!

You can absolutely live a normal life. Don't get discouraged or sink into negative grandiosity. You're gonna be ok and there are people who are competent to treat this. 

Good luck üíõ",t3_kkscks
gh45s1p,t3_kkscks,"If your concerned I recommend you go see a therapist. However to be diagnosed with NPD, or any personality disorder, you have to be 18.",t3_kkscks
gh5a9fk,t3_kkscks,"I'm 18 and kinda going through the same realisation
My mother is a classic example of narcissism and now when I look at her I just can't accept the fact that if I don't change I'm gonna end up like her 
Even my boyfriend pointed out the same and legit asked me ""how can you love me if you are a narcissist?""
I mean it has happened in the past too and the worst part being first narcissists don't seek help as long as they are desperate af , having tried everything you just wanna root for a normal life 
Now when I'm trying, everywhere I look you get feeded by the same bullshit ""not curable"" , ""emotional monsters"" , ""nothing can change a narcissist"" 
I mean at the end of the day we are humans too ?",t3_kkscks
gh48sgk,t1_gh483xx,"thank you so much for that bro, I really appreciate your response ‚ù§,  

""but if you are seeing traits the bother you, hold onto your moments of clarity!"" could you explain what you mean by that a little more it seems very interesting",t3_kkscks
gh47k74,t1_gh45s1p,not everyone has the money or ability to reach a therapist if I could I wouldn't resort to post on reddit lol,t3_kkscks
gh9dbr3,t1_gh5a9fk,"have you manipulated or abused your boyfriend in anyway is that why he'd ask you if your a narcissist? and a another thing you needa ask yourself is also ""do I have OCD""? and are these intrusive thoughts and fears of narcissism in that form and if so should I really be freaking out this much, becuz I've had these fears for about a year or so now in the severe times its in the form of some sort of OCD attack where I'm franticly questioning everything I do and think, to collect evidence for if god forbid I'm a narcissist, recently these fears and doubts were brought on by reading or watching something that closely resembles something that I missed a lot in life ex. close intimate relationships. 

and ye thas facts it do be like a witch hunt out their against narcissists but only those who have been very abusive in relationships not just anyone on the narcissism spectrum (everyone's somewhere on it) becuz a lot of other people who might be branded as narcissists are simply people who life's been very unfair with and are going through many mental heath issues.",t3_kkscks
gh4akbx,t1_gh48sgk,"Absolutely. I'm sorry you're going through this. It means a lot to me if my experience can serve some good after all the pain.

Seeing traits that bother you* 

Yeah, so with any mental health issue, you'll have moments of clarity. It's impossible to really know when you slip into demonizing yourself without some outside feedback, but it's also a danger to just suppress concerns for years on end. 

Johari window is a good mental tool you can look up. 

Also after watching a peer with mental health issues, it's just impressed upon me what denial can look like. And it has taken years of my life away. 

Those niggling thoughts can be underneath everything for years and years. Some examples from my experience.. ""why can't I follow through on x?"" ""Do I really like this person?"" ""Why am I alone?"" ""People seem to not like me"" ""Why can't I let go if I don't like them, this is wrong"" ""why do I never feel ok to just be"" ""am I using this person?"" ""They are pathetic!"" And way further down ""But I feel inferior""

Also, if you really do have this, you've probably been through a lot, so don't be too hard on yourself. You have a valuable perspective and legitimate experiences too.",t3_kkscks
gh4cv18,t1_gh47k74,"It's no one's job on this sub to help you or diagnose you. All I can say is there are plenty of helplines out there which are free, best to ring one of them up.",t3_kkscks
gh47oso,t1_gh47k74,Then don‚Äôt come cryin‚Äô to Reddit lol,t3_kkscks
gh91khj,t1_gh4akbx,"yea I completely agree with you, but id like to point out the fact that all people are somewhere on the narcissism spectrum, some people are higher, some lower, some are extreme (NPD) some are almost there, its different for everyone however self loathing isn't the answer self analyzation and realization is (being brutally honest with ones self) becuz you can lie to the world but never yourself entirely, thank you so much for the Johari window idea ill try it more often, I heard meditation is also helpful in increasing empathy, what do you say about mediation as a way to better my (persons) overall empathy?",t3_kkscks
gh91pjm,t1_gh4cv18,"I'm here to share an experience who tf said I want a diagnosis, cheer up bro",t3_kkscks
gh47yfh,t1_gh47oso,"ouuu keyboard warrior nice, ever thought bout being tough to peoples face?",t3_kkscks
gh91vls,t1_gh91khj,"
Yeah, you may not have it! You could totally be in a normal range and still benefit from some self work :) didn't mean to impose any of my experience on yours.

Meditation, go for it! You could meditate on what others may be feeling or experiencing (mentalizing) or you could do it through the day (mindfulness is a kind of meditation)! Seems like you know what you want to try!",t3_kkscks
gh4jmdm,t1_gh47yfh,"Tough? I‚Äôm just trying to help you here, kiddo. You can‚Äôt believe everybody you hear from on this site. It‚Äôs better to just wait until you‚Äôre 18 to get a diagnosis and in the meantime, better yourself as a person generally.",t3_kkscks
gh9btl9,t1_gh91vls,"again thank you for the insight.

I would like to say one last thing tho as it seems you have more than valid experience with NPD and mental health and for that you have my respect almost entirely due to the fact that its no ones fault its not mine nor yours that life was unfair and we had to toughen up and fight back with hands and teeth, we had to cope ourselves or maybe entirely through one person while others had arms all around them for comfort, we are unlucky only becuz we saw the ugly sides of life while others were sheltered and that effected us to any certain extent.  

N**arcissism** is a survival mechanism that is developed like callouses over time to protect from what we wish we hadn't seen. Isn't it ironic that people who've been through hell and back at a young age tend to have a higher chance of having mental health issues than others tho none of those experiences may be their fault; there's a saying ""for some people the hardest thing ever was to lose their charger for some their mother"" there's a difference between experiences and ours for some reason tho you'd expected it to toughen us up in a good way rather lead to us here.",t3_kkscks
gh8yma1,t1_gh4jmdm,fair enough thank you.,t3_kkscks
gh9e4yz,t1_gh9btl9,"Love everything you said :) thanks for sharing that. We are gonna get this, even though it's hard as hell üôè  It's great having this community.",t3_kkscks
