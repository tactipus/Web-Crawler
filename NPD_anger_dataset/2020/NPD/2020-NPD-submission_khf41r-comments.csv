ggkwei7,t3_khf41r,"Given I suppose the function of narcissistic defence mechanisms which are to protect ourselves and avoid being hurt by others by throwing up barriers (which is also probably why we donâ€™t develop empathy in the normal way as we avoid using it to maintain our safety or to continue doing whatever we want) I think this is totally understandable. No one wants to get hurt and empathy can hurt us, either by making us realise what weâ€™ve done to other people or by stopping us taking what we want. It also means that we get closer to others and become more vulnerable to them as a result. If youâ€™ve spent a long time avoiding vulnerability it makes sense that your defence mechanisms would go into overdrive when you are seemingly under threat.

Also, I know weâ€™re all supposed to be looking for the good in people and all that but weâ€™re not going to click with everyone. Itâ€™s just not possible and all people are selective around who theyâ€™ll interact with. 95% of the time I think people are ok, nice, harmless or whatever but that doesnâ€™t mean I want anything to do with them. I suppose the problems come if this part of the avoidance I was describing before. I know Iâ€™ll keep people away to avoid feeling, particularly when it comes to family.

You sound like youâ€™re a bit disassociated tbh and I suppose Iâ€™m wondering if the lack of human connection is part of that?",t3_khf41r

gglazcm,t3_khf41r,"Our existences are one in the same.

I've been in a state of melancholous dysphoria for over nearly 2 years now.  

I donâ€™t want to be negative or depress myself or others any further, but cannot fake optimism... Idk tho, cynical, *misanthropical*, and morbidly retaining dispositions to seclusion are prominent characteristics others now accept & anticipate out of me, by this point. 

*I still wish I could experience, even vicariously, happiness.* 

I know this cynicism has an inherently *ephemeral* nature....Still, I reallyyyy need to strive to abstemious habits & retain a mature, optimistic disposition.Â  So, I guess.. Hereâ€™s to anticipating the emergence of hope from our afflictions*...* & actively manifesting joy spring forth from my distress.   
Fake it till you make it, champ. XD",t3_khf41r
ggkxrkk,t3_khf41r,"(Im guessing, if u r full blown npd) Its cuz u truly lack emotional empathy (not ur fault) but u have cognitive empathy so u feel like ur wearing a mask and so over time it hurts to wear a mask. Its so much work n its so heavy. Either ur mask slips n they hate u or see u as evil n then u feel like shit. Or u start slipping in feel guilty, u may be abusing someone in some sense. Or maybe u r exploiting other even if its little things, may make u feel guilty because those traits r looked down upon in society. There can be different reasons. U just may be expecting things back from others when u do things for them, and when they dont, it may hurt and u may feel upset or annoyed and feel like theres no point in being empathetic. This is y its important to go to a (trained and specialised) therapist n deconstruct ur ptsd n work thru these things, so u can naturally be and act the way ur mind wants u to act. So ur heart n mind r in the same place. Also be careful if ur overextending urself for others. Now thats a different issue. (A lot of these feelings are going on subconsciously btw)",t3_khf41r
ggkw4uo,t3_khf41r,It's possible you are surrounded by boring people. Have you tried changing your environment to find a place you might find more exciting? Don't blame the puddle if you're the one standing in it.,t3_khf41r

ggmazcx,t1_ggl2f4x,"I cannot win with this whole empathy thing. 

Faking it means lying which is morally wrong by most people's standard. If people find out there's also lots of blowback, People will call you manipulative. 

So you'd think not faking it would the morally superior option. But of course people don't like that either!",t3_khf41r
gglztfs,t1_ggl2f4x,Iâ€™m pretty judgemental and find the whole genuine thing hard. Guess itâ€™s about moving ourselves out of situations where we donâ€™t have to fake stuff and hide what we think. Doesnâ€™t help much with work tho lol.,t3_khf41r

Ok this is way harder than I thought. But maybe there's a couple you could try?",t3_khf41r
ggkzgdv,t1_ggkxrkk,not his fault but his choice to be an arsehole.,t3_khf41r
ggms7sy,t1_ggmazcx,"I agree with you, the key is not lying. It is ok if you don't care about someone or don't feel his pain, the problem starts when we exploit people to do what we want then we don't treat them the same again.

For example someone at work is having tough time and I need a ride home from him, so I make it look like I care and tell him/her let's talk about it in the car on our way and I start acting that I am listening and give advices, next time when the same person goes through a rough patch and comes to me -while I don't need him/her- and expects me to do the same he'll find that I am not listening and I almost don't see him, that will hurt much more and will make them feel used.

So I guess that yes, the key is not lying.",t3_khf41r

ggqfavk,t1_ggms7sy,"I know itâ€™s just an example, but it resonates with me and for arguments sake Iâ€™d like to look a little deeper at it.

What you described was a physical service exchanged for an emotional service. A transaction. Nothing wrong with that, transactional interactions are always going to be necessary and are a good way to operate until trust develops. Successful transactional interactions help build trust for deeper, more genuine interactions.

I think part of the problem occurs in terms of the nature of the exchange over multiple interactions. While a one off physical for emotional service interaction felt ok, assuming with asking that more similar transactions will also be fine seems to me to be somewhat selfish. 

Imagine that instead of providing emotional support during that car ride you had a pleasant, chill time listening to music and you baked a pie instead, to thank that person for the ride. A week later, they come back to you and say â€œthat pie was so good, just what I needed. Iâ€™m going to need you to make me anotherâ€œ. 

Most people would be taken aback by that, I think. But a request for emotional support is viewed differently for some reason, even if it takes a far greater resource toll on the giving person than say making a pie might. Also, there is no transactional benefit for the other person, and relationship is not yet intimate enough to sustain one-sided benefits without tension/resentment. 

So I donâ€™t so much know if the issue is â€˜lyingâ€™ or not, for one can still give graciously, without need of reciprocation if you are truly able to view what you give as a gift. But there needs to be internal motivation to feel that way, conditioning. To view the act of giving, and not the given service or item itself as the gift... and I suppose if one isnâ€™t quite there then radical honesty may be the best way to approach this. I do think honesty is an easier strategy for men though - women refusing to provide other women with emotional support are risk of being socially ostracised in some environments and even being able to tell if an environment can handle that level of honesty is also fraught with risk...

Iâ€˜m not sure if I have a point here or not, but reciprocity is something Iâ€™ve been mulling over and working on for some time, and my own experiences with some people can be too messy to break down like this, so your nice clear example was great to work with instead, thanks :)",t3_khf41r
ggrtr91,t1_ggm9ian,"as in, itâ€™s not your fault, but your choice to be an arsehole. like, not your fault, but your choice, sort of. not fault but choice. choice over fault. you choose to be an arsehole. you could choose not to be. itâ€™s not your fault you have a disorder, but you make a fully informed, calculated, measured and educated decision to be an arsehole, when you could choose not to be. so, again, not your fault but it is your choice. sorry you canâ€™t understand grammar without capitalisation. itâ€™s another difficult subtlety to navigate, but life does have its challenges.",t3_khf41r
ggl6kuz,t1_ggl1h4s,"ooh sorry i know theyâ€™re delicate little petals, these ones. letâ€™s not worry about their victims though. that might hurt the npdsâ€™ little feelings.",t3_khf41r
ggw73s5,t1_ggrtr91,"Thanks for explaining yourself. So you are saying that being an asshole is separate from the disorder. I can agree that many use that excuse to justify their actions. 

As you said life has its challenges and it's no different for me. Not so easy to shrug off deep seated emotional issues.",t3_khf41r
ggl7rkq,t1_ggl6kuz,They have a personality disorder... I never said you shouldn't worry about the victims...,t3_khf41r
gglzb8u,t1_ggl6kuz,"What are you even here sorry? You do realise this is a forum for people who are in recovery and trying to understand themselves. Donâ€™t get me wrong, if youâ€™ve been hurt by someone with NPD (or any empathy disorder) then I totally get why you would want to have a go but ultimately doing it somewhere like this means you are more likely to set people back and ultimately make it more likely that they hurt other people in the long run.",t3_khf41r
ggl8dly,t1_ggl6kuz,"Also not everyone with npd leaves a trail of victims because you're correct, it's a choice and some choose not to abuse others. But they still suffer with a debilitating personality disorder.",t3_khf41r
ggsdpre,t1_ggl8dly,"yes, a choice. disorder is not their fault, but being an arsehole is a choice.",t3_khf41r
