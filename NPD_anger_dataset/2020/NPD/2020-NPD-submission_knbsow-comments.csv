ghkj76w,t3_knbsow,"i dont think you are a narcissist. in fact you seem very well put together in your approach to yourself and this situation. the lying and gaslighting are specific issues you should work on but its clear to me the core issue is the shame surrounding the instances you described. the perspective you have to this relationship is good though, bpd is difficult to have and he needs to know he can trust you, its very hard to feel safe when there are cracks in that trust. best of luck to both of you.",t3_knbsow
ghli653,t1_ghkj76w,"This doesn't seem like narcissism to me because you appear to genuinely feel sorry for your hurtful actions and are also able to admit to your ""lies."" As a narc, I have difficult feeling sorry for anyone but myself. When I lie, I don't even know it (crazy right?), but even when presented with facts I deny them and so I perpetuate the lie even if I have already been exposed (sad, isn't it?).",t3_knbsow
