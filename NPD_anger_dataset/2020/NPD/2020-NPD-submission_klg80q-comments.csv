gh9jub0,t3_klg80q,"You’re very self aware, whatever it is. For context, I have traits of NPD, BPD, ADHD and OCD. I have what would probably be termed as a mixed personality disorder which I have been attempting to recover from for many years. The reason I say this is because we don’t all necessarily fit easily into specific boxes. As much as there is an enormous drive to label ourselves to understand basically what is wrong and how to fix it, it’s not necessarily clear cut.

Like you, I am powerfully empathic but use it incredibly selectively to connect with people I want and respect and basically straight up ignore it when it comes to people I don’t. In fact ignore is the wrong description, it just isn’t ‘on’ though I could use it if I chose to. And if I get bored of you (which at some point i probably will) I will just move on, taking all my empathy and care with me and you’ll be left probably wondering what the hell happened and what you did wrong. The answer is usually nothing.

In terms of relationship superiority I just presume I’m the best. However, if I’m not, or I suspect there is someone else, either current or past, I will lose my mind. I specifically only choose people who adore me for this very reason, I basically can’t handle not being the one in control in relationships. When I was young I didn’t realise this and did a lot of fucked up shit trying to maintain control and usually embarrassing myself hideously in the process.

I think all we can do is look at the traits and behaviour, try to understand the root and control them. I think our drives lose some of their power once we have unearthed what they are linked to and why we do what we do. Bringing the subconcious to light ameliorates a lot of it’s power. What I’ve done to recover is brutal self realisation and accountability. Intimate relationships are what I struggle with the most and I’m at the point where I think I might actually need therapy if I could find someone I respect to help me deal with it. 

You sound like you are very switched on to what is happening to you which is half the battle. It’s whether you can understand and control it yourself. Personally I’ve managed to get so far with this approach but it appears the more stubborn issues will not shift.",t3_klg80q

gha6yvo,t3_klg80q,Work on self acceptance and understanding.  You don’t have to be perfect or the most important it’s literally impossible to live up to this standard which is why a lot of NPDers crash and go depresso into a cycle of self loathing and hatred.,t3_klg80q
ghavl2u,t3_klg80q,"Remember that narcissism can be conceptualized as a spectrum. Everyone displays narcissistic traits to some degree and there is such a thing as ['healthy narcissism'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthy_narcissism). 

I see you've identified a number of traits you feel to be narcissistic. There's no need to identify these as pathological, unless you are getting feedback from several people in your life that your behavior is damaging them. Remember that NPD, BPD and other Cluster B disorders can also be conceptualized as a response to trauma. You may benefit more by investigating the *origins* of your narcissistic defences. 

This looks something like the following. How has feeling special or superior helped you in the past? Do you still need that around to help you cope? Perhaps feeling special is a way to avoid feelings of shame linked to being inferior, or avoid the feeling of not being good enough, or about avoiding anxiety, or about something else entirely. If stuff comes up: feel it to heal it. Some amount of narcissistic defence is perfectly normal and you can became self-aware in this domain just as one does with 'problems' which aren't viewed so negatively, e.g. social anxiety, workaholic behavior, people-pleasing etc.

To look more into this way of thinking, read [this short write-up by Pete Walker on 'the 4 Fs'](http://www.pete-walker.com/fourFs_TraumaTypologyComplexPTSD.htm). Stuff on the fawn response (codependency) and fight response (narcissism) might be most interesting to you. I find it's a very non-judgemental framework for working with narcissistic traits. 

If you find yourself hooked on the 'narcissist' label (I have!) ask yourself what it does for you to see yourself as 'all bad' or 'pathological'. In my experience, with the help of my therapist, I figured out that my fixation with me accusing myself of being a narcissist was a way to deny my past traumas and also avoid taking responsibility for my actions. If you're a monster, it's easy: you don't need to feel pain or the pain you cause others.

I also went down this rabbit hole after having a very difficult relationship with someone I believe to have narcissistic traits. Look out for the [FLEAs phenomenon](https://outofthefog.website/what-not-to-do-1/2015/12/3/fleas), where people close to  narcissists can take on some of their traits as an adaptive response. Would you want to share more about your experiences in that relationship here or elsewhere? It might be a good way to get some more feedback. If you do make a new post, please send me the link and I'd be interested to read more. Take care!",t3_klg80q

gha2t09,t1_gh9jub0,"thank you very much this has been incredibly helpful! i agree with you, where i have mixed traits of each and don’t seem to fit into either box, but as you said i do understand it isn’t essential to label myself! 

i just need to do some work to try and alienate the root cause/s of whatever is making me act like this - probably building up my self esteem would be a start. what did you do once you realised how you act is wrong?",t3_klg80q
gha2x4f,t1_gh9h0y6,"you see on surface level i wouldn’t define myself as insecure, but these behaviours obviously indicate extreme insecurity and realising this i know my first thing to reflect upon and fix - thank you for your insight!",t3_klg80q
ghbgsi1,t1_ghavl2u,"wow thank you for taking the time to write this, it has been extremely insightful! 

i agree with your first point, i don’t believe i’ve seriously hurt anyone with this behaviour, but it damages my view of relationships and to avoid dysfunctional relationships in the future i’m definitely working on correcting this.

i do believe making myself feel special is a coping mechanism. my first experience of ‘love’ at a young age (around 14/15) was with who i believe was also a narcissist, i spent a year repeatedly going through the narcissistic abuse cycle of idealising, devaluing, discarding and then love bombing / hoovering until i finally had enough. so it seems completely realistic that due to being made to feel not good enough, i’ve now began to strive to be ‘the best’ so that no one can make me feel average or small. as you said, it definitely could be a ‘FLEA’ or a fight / fawn response to this abuse.

going forward i definitely need to try and get myself out of the victim mindset and take accountability for my actions, and establish firm, healthy boundaries in the future, rather being hooked on this ‘narcissist’ label.",t3_klg80q
ghavmfc,t1_ghavl2u,"**[Healthy narcissism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthy narcissism)**

Healthy narcissism is a positive sense of self that is in alignment with the greater good. The concept of healthy narcissism was first coined by Paul Federn and gained prominence in the 1970s through the research of by Heinz Kohut and Otto Kernberg. It developed slowly out of the psychoanalytic tradition, and became popular in the late twentieth century.The concept of healthy narcissism is used clinical psychology and popular psychology as an aid to self-assertion and success. It has indeed been suggested that it is useful to think of a continuum of narcissism, ranging from deficient to healthy to pathological, with stable narcissism and destructive narcissism as stopping-points in between.

ghahv9r,t1_gha2t09,"Building your self esteem up and making your superiority real (lol) is a big part of it. I’ve noticed a theme, in that some of us were gifted children who used our intelligence to feel better about ourselves but crashed when we realised there were other people who were equal to or better than we were and gave up as a result. Part of it is either realising our potential or accepting what we’ve achieved thus far as being enough, or at least that the path we’re on is sufficient. It might not have be academic, but there’s often some talent or skill we’ve had which we’ve usually failed to translate into something useful and can still use, I guess, to build how we want to feel about ourselves into something of substance.

The other thing is distress tolerance and controlling reactions. I can do it for the minor things, like if someone snarks at me on the Internet but if I’m called out in reality, I’ll still flip. I might now not do it externally however.

We probably have something of an advantage in that we still have access to empathy, even if it isn’t fully functional. So like we can figure out what we are doing is wrong if someone points it out to us and explains the consequences (and depending on what stage we are at, either integrate it and change or get angry, ignore it entirely and carry on regardless because we aren’t ready yet lol). 

To be upfront, this is a painful process and it requires brutal self realisation. However, I don’t believe we can fully change and recover unless we feel the impact of what we have done to others. Also, it’s likely your brain will only let you access this stuff when you’re ready for it. Certain realisations will take a short time to internalise and improve, others take years, or even decades. 

To give an example, I got called out for being arrogant and too direct at work. To start with I was really upset and horrified I’d come across in that way (and if I’m being totally honest was pissed off people weren’t recognising my superiority - yes I know - and just getting on with whatever the fuck I’d told them to do). It took me months to absorb this and adapt my communication style. I’ve partly done it because there are people I like who I don’t want to upset but mainly because it has had real life consequences for me and I didn’t like them. I imagine in a few years I might realise that acting like a dick and making people feel bad because they’ve pissed me off, or I’m just in a mood isn’t ok. I know that cognitively now but don’t really feel it yet and am just going through the motions because I know I need to, rather than actually feeling that I should or want to. 

Something at some point will probably happen where someone will tell me how I made them feel, or how I came across and it will connect up properly and I’ll have actually integrated it then and won’t do it again (or will be unlikely to). I find you have to try to go through the motions before it wires in properly.

Other things are harder and much deeper rooted. My addiction to attention and need for intense connections is close to impossible to manage in the moment at times. I spent years cheating and flipping from one ‘soulmate’ or ‘the one’ to the next with zero concept of irony. I mistake or mistook the power and intensity of lust for love. I’m not wired properly for long term stable love and attachment as I never experienced it as a child and I am still learning it now and trying my best not to get drawn back into these drama cycles with unsuitable men. However, if someone charismatic flirts with me I am not going to be able to control myself fully in the moment. At this stage there’s literally fucking no chance, however, I will now be able to detach myself and examine what’s actually going on after the fact. Now I know what it is and why I’m doing it, it’s easier to separate myself. However, the drug remains. I’m 40 years old and it only dawned on me a few months ago that using my powers on people to get attention, making them fall in love with me and then withdrawing brutally and instantly might be a bit cruel. Basically, I’m still a fucked up child treating a lot of life like a game and ignoring the real, long term consequences for myself and particularly other people.

Basically, our frontal cortex (decision making and long term consequence recognition) and empathy circuits are dysfunctionally wired and we have to wire them in properly ourselves as adults. The good news is that the brain has a lot of plasticity, the bad news is we are reaching for feelings we’ve never had and it takes a lot of figuring out. We have a head start as we know what empathy is, we just don’t use it properly yet.

Anyway, I hope this is useful, I find that examples help me to make sense of all of this.

You are doing very well to recognise as much as you do and are already on the path. You should be proud of yourself - don’t beat yourself up too much for what you’ve done in the past. Yes we need to feel it to get the consequences but repeatedly beating ourselves up is counterproductive. All we can do is learn and grow after the initial acknowledgement.",t3_klg80q
ghajca0,t1_ghahv9r,"wow! i completely understand the ‘gifted kid burnout’ , constantly being told you’re significantly smarter than your peers, not having to try etc. and then when everyone else begins to catch up with you, you’re left with little to no work ethic and resort to procrastination as a defence mechanism! it’s upsetting knowing you’re not at your full potential, especially as someone who strives to feel superior!

i’ve being doing a lot of self reflection this morning after reading the comments i’ve received. i’ve attributed a lot of my behaviours as defence mechanisms after a relationship with an overt narcissist, where i was constantly compared to other ‘better’ people, made to feel not good enough, and being cheated on. i’ve figured i’ve adopted severe people pleasing tendencies, and i guess to avoid feeling inadequate, i instead strive for complete perfection, and aim to be the best so that no one can make me feel average. obviously it’s not fair to play the victim here and i have to take accountability for my own behaviours, especially where i’ve used people and manipulated their feelings for me in an attempt to make myself feel better. 

thank you for all the examples and help, it’s very much appreciated! i hope all this self reflection will help me avoid hurting other people, and help me establish a healthier relationship with myself!",t3_klg80q
