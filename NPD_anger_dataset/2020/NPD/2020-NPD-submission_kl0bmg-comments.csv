gh5yhcx,t3_kl0bmg,"That monster helped protect me during my childhood. If anything, I'm quite grateful to have at least one companion that I can trust in this wicked world.",t3_kl0bmg
gh8nvy5,t3_kl0bmg,Can I ask a weird question? Does a person with npd recycle exes?,t3_kl0bmg
ghcqvay,t3_kl0bmg,Did you see Soul by Disney at all? It demonstrated ‘lost souls’ in exactly the same way as this and I found the cartoon movie soooo great at summarising our psychology in a lot of ways . Would recommend as a watch,t3_kl0bmg
gh5z6cg,t1_gh5yhcx,But you end up being part of the Wicked world.,t3_kl0bmg
gh6jxeo,t1_gh5yhcx,i agree with you that monster sure helped me but now he is out of control,t3_kl0bmg
gh6db1a,t1_gh5yhcx,"could you elaborate, i’m fascinates by npd. but i also keep procrastinating on reddit.",t3_kl0bmg
gh9wuzo,t1_gh8nvy5,"In my case, I try to stay as far as possible from my exes. The cycle always starts with admiration (almost worshipping) to extremely dissapointed in the other person (can't even be in the same room with them). Ending witg ghosting my exes and avoid seeing them for the rest of my life.",t3_kl0bmg
gh5zffa,t1_gh5z6cg,"What are you talking about? I'm terrific. And the entire world is wicked.

Yeah, it's an insidious pattern of thought.",t3_kl0bmg
gh61c78,t1_gh5z6cg,"To hell with the world. Let it burn. If someone get burned along the way, it's because they don't have their own monster to protect them.",t3_kl0bmg
gh6p2lv,t1_gh6jxeo,"Maybe my AVPD has checked the monster but it's been a long time since I raged. At worst, I'll just collect people's secrets, ready to defend myself when they attack. But thanks to my AvPD, I've never taken the initiative attack for fear of retribution.

Weirdly, I've always felt as if my monster has the appearance  of a good looking man, he is warm and protective like a big brother.",t3_kl0bmg
gh6fhe0,t1_gh6db1a,"I was abused (sexually for months) and gaslighted in my childhood. After that period, I felt like there's a second voice in my mind telling me not to trust anyone and that everybody will harm me if I let my guard down. I've always think of that voice as my armor (or as the op stated = the monster). 

If anything, that voice kept me sane by constantly telling the abuse I endured was real/ It did happened, while other people told me the person who inflicted it mean no harm, or that I just made it up.

So, I'm grateful that I have that monster to protect me in that period, otherwise I would have gone crazy during that confusing time.",t3_kl0bmg
gh5zqjp,t1_gh5zffa,"Until you push every one away.
There is justice in this Wicked world.
You have Neglected taking care of your inner self but Created a Monster out of Balloon. That every body fears to face.

When you start remmembering the people you hurt you will know how horrific this monster is.",t3_kl0bmg

gh6fmoh,t1_gh61c78,"I've seen the monster, shaking from fear, ashamed, lost and lonesome. The later you turn, the painfuller it get's. The older you get the more difficult it gets.",t3_kl0bmg
gh60ikk,t1_gh5zqjp,"Well, I've been there already. I'm just saying it's a runaway train. Better hope the tracks are uphill and that there's no turns in the track. And no one sticks around to continue feeding coal.",t3_kl0bmg
gh6699j,t1_gh652en,"Thanks mate! Since recognized my symptoms and my covert NPD,  I have accepted and tonned down my rage/injury/reaction. The comment I made above was half joke/ half true. I've been limited the number of people in my social circle to avoid hurting them.",t3_kl0bmg
gh94an0,t1_gh652en,"And increase the pain of those who don't have the luxury of relying on a protector for safety and still have to face the pain of the human experience. I too empathize with anyone who's childhood experience has  led them to rely on such a destructive coping mechanism. You've clearly not been spared the pain of being human either. Do your best to recognize how your actions have affected others, feel the guilt if need be, but don't beat yourself up and avoid shame at all costs. Empathy, remorse and accountability, develope those and you'll have no use for the Monster.",t3_kl0bmg
gh60xw1,t1_gh60ikk,"Its not a good monater its like drugs :/
All kind of bipolar disorders are drugs.
Its a Coping Mechanism until it hurts you.

When it doesn't work it will hurt you so much.
Until you treat your self.

My Ex NPD Friend I have seen him collapse.
Even when we shared rooms at collrgr.

I saw Him Depressed at night openning his facebook.
He looks very happy at morning but at night he keeps scrolling facebook and not wanting to talk.
Can you relatw this btw :/",t3_kl0bmg

gh62wdw,t1_gh60xw1,"I got off facebook lol. But I had long periods of depression too. I didn't know what was causing it, but I figured out it was because I wasn't feeding the monster.",t3_kl0bmg
gk0ksy5,t1_gh60xw1,Look up bpd.,t3_kl0bmg
gh69auo,t1_gh67psz,I have my NPD siblings who supported me and even checked me before I would fall into a rage (and I'll do the same for them). Maybe it's an asian thing but we three siblings just stick together through thick and thin are kind of immune to each other's manipulation/envy/rage.,t3_kl0bmg
gk0qyzq,t1_gk0ksy5,Its not BPD. Its Naracism because I have bren taken advantage of and I have seen projecting,t3_kl0bmg
