ggy9hws,t3_kjpzj0,Not sure but I remember my ex narc friend said he had memory problems.,t3_kjpzj0
ghvnj17,t3_kjpzj0,Please don't use r/NPD for questions. r/NPD is a support group for people with NPD. Please use r/askNPD.,t3_kjpzj0
ghlfvkb,t1_ggy9hws,"This might be an instance of self-realization of your ""real"" self vs your ""perceived"" self. For a while, I struggled (and still do in many ways) with understanding how the person I thought I was (e.g. responsible, caring, normal but with little emotion) applied only to interactions with strangers and not to my relationship with my wife (e.g. irresponsible, self-centered, emotionless). Let me know if you have questions I might be able to help with based on my current battle with my NPD.",t3_kjpzj0
ghlg5o0,t1_ghlfvkb,Its wonderfull you are healing. What about making execuses why you break promises? When you do do you know you aee intwntionally doing it?,t3_kjpzj0
ghuq3rc,t1_ghlg5o0,"I am healing, but very very slowly based on outside observation... My logic is fucked up and I learned it from my equally fucked up narc mom, who always makes excuses. I think I'm providing reasons, but they are just excuses. I didn't understand the difference between reasons and excuses for the longest time, even after reading many articles online (stupid huh?)... NOW I am much more aware of whether what comes to mind may be an excuse, but very often I still get confused because of my narc logic. I must rewire my thinking!!",t3_kjpzj0
ghurfrb,t1_ghuq3rc,"I understand.
are you intentionally breaking promises and try to justify it?

Its good you are self aware, you are improving.
My narc friend is long buried in his delusions he doesn't even remmember me.

You are doing great keep it up.",t3_kjpzj0
