None of us have a choice in the manner in which our trauma manifests. Sometimes, we end up having potential to become the same monsters that caused us to acquire a debilitating, deeply ingrained mental illness, in the first place.

My mother was a borderline narcissist, and here I am.. a borderline narcissist.. Who was not even aware she was in narcissist because, she is attracted to the same exact type of toxicity that destroyed her during the most vulnerable developmental years. I was just drawn to the only displays of ""love"" I'd never had presented in front of me... Abuse was all I knew. It was almost a comforting motion to exist in that toxicity.

This is also a huge reason I hate some of the narcissistic abuse subreddits on here... because they will not allow narcissists to comment even though narcissists are, a lot of times... What may have made us narcissists in the first place",t3_kgubrg
ggiyefj,t3_kgubrg,"anyone can be abused by anyone rly, there's always a bigger fish who is smarter or more able in other areas to put them in that stance. rly it's just a matter of opportunity someone uses to their advantage. even neurotypicals go into abusing people sometimes just for the sake of unloading their emotional baggage or other times because they assumed this is what needed to be done when really it was a false estimation that caused someone to be hurt from their bad judgement. bad judgement is really the cause of most abuse, brought on by false assumptions or not confirmed once which can be equally as bad since they are most often false or just overblown out of the proportions. not to go into a wordsalad ramble mess (i'm working on this currently in therapy not to spew so much garbage, u see) but most of the time the cause of abuse is unregulated assumptions that are then carried out to unjustly punish someone for smth they mostly haven‚Äôt done hmmm: how do we stop this? forget informed guesses and face truths head on in a fair and verbal exchange üòè...",t3_kgubrg
ggihwwx,t3_kgubrg,This.,t3_kgubrg
ggjiejx,t3_kgubrg,"Sure. Lots of NPD people swear their abusing parents were NPD too. 

You should try to work with one psychiatrist for a long period of time. Many diagnosis are a bad sign, and something you should tell a psychiatrist to account for when working with you. 

Having NPD wouldn't make it more or less likely to notice abuse from others.",t3_kgubrg
ggjvbyv,t1_ggihwwx,Sorry nothing I say makes sense ever,t3_kgubrg
ggjvqu4,t1_ggjiejx,lol someone told me once the reason i was attracted to villains in tv & movies was because i wanted them to protect me from abuse from my parents I didn‚Äôt see them as abusive though ....but now I‚Äôm not sure if maybe I just forgot. I do remember I would always have nightmares about them abusing me when I was a child..... so the one person I told this to said those probably weren‚Äôt dreams.  üò≥,t3_kgubrg
ggjw60i,t1_ggjvqu4,I'm no expert but children don't typically have nightmares about being abused by adults. It's not an image that randomly pops into their minds without a reference for it.,t3_kgubrg
ggjw7nd,t1_ggjvqu4,"I saw a meme on r/npd_memes about that. The point was people with cluster B have the same upbringing as the villains. 

There was a bunch of research on false memories done in the 80s and 90s (you can look up satanic preschools if you feel like hating humanity for a while) - basically if you can forget it, do forget it. It probably wasn't bad or things would be much worse, and you'd need solid evidence to back the severe responses you're likely to have if you believed it as true. The current clinical practice is first you should try moving forward before looking back - you only look back to help move forward when you can't otherwise.",t3_kgubrg
ggjwdb4,t1_ggjw7nd,"For real like I had all these new memories pop up and I always get confused on what happened in real life and what didn‚Äôt, so I‚Äôm like not even sure what the truth is",t3_kgubrg
ggjwlgy,t1_ggjwdb4,"Yeah but the witness you're relying on isn't just a child, but it's your memories of the memories and interpretations of a child. I don't think it's worth looking into unless you think the same people are likely to abuse children going forward. Concentrate on your own progress until your past becomes a barrier - obviously don't close your eyes to new evidence.",t3_kgubrg
