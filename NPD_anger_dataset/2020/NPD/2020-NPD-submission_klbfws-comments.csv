gh8ve95,t3_klbfws,"I do sometimes. I have this self-destruction mode where I’m in some kind of existential pain, loneliness, death desire mixed with weird fascination and sweet melancholy. I just want to destroy myself, my health, my relationships, everything. So I get drunk, talk to toxic people, cut myself (always somewhere I can hide) etc. The narcissism in this was for example last time when I cut my hip and the skin on my ribs pretty badly I took some sick sexy pictures and sent it to the guy I met on the Internet and was flirting with at the time. So I think narcissists self-harm too. This CAN’T differentiate NPD from BPD though, especially that they’re both cluster B (connected with strong emotions) disorders. The risk is probably bigger than in healthy population, but it depends on a person, how exactly their personality is organized, if they have mental illnesses, like depression etc.",t3_klbfws
gh8bz61,t3_klbfws,"I don’t know a lot on this part, but I myself frequently consider self harm/suicidal but can’t get myself to do any of it. One exception is that I used to purposefully bang my head on the wall sometimes when I was upset as a child",t3_klbfws
gh9mn94,t3_klbfws,I used to self harm but I'm letting the critics n naysayers win if I do that...,t3_klbfws
gi13ddj,t3_klbfws,"I usually bite my arms when I'm stressed, like when my parents are fighting, or when I'm about to miss a deadline, or when I keep failing a level in a game, it's more of an impulsive thing, a way for me to cope with emotions I don't know how to cope with. It's hard to deal with how flawed I am and the world is sometimes. 

Suicidal thoughts is another thing. It's both brings pain and excitement. Sometimes I use it as a way to force myself to do something I don't want to, sometimes it's just an excuse for me to procrastinate and to do things I would feel guilty doing. Like, I could just play video games all day and ignore all schoolwork because I am planning to kill myself in a week anyway. At the higher point in my life, I also thought about it because it would make people feel surprised and curious. Attentions right?",t3_klbfws
