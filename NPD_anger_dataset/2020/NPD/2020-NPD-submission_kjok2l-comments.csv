ggy36l2,t3_kjok2l,"Well fuck. My life would have been better to have that happen at 17.

Sorry. Don't mean to downplay your experience. Good job. You'll figure it out. And you'll be okay.",t3_kjok2l
ggy6tu4,t3_kjok2l,What lead you to realize this if you don‚Äôt mind me asking? NPD traits do not necessarily equal the personality disorder. You‚Äôd be surprised at how malleable a 17-year old‚Äôs brain & personality can be.,t3_kjok2l
ggybaap,t3_kjok2l,"Hey I know how confusing and depressing this realisation is, but there is definitely hope. Even if it takes 10 years to get better, you will only be 27 and have potentially 60 years left. You may end up a better person than most people because you will manually relearn how to act well, sending love",t3_kjok2l
ggyfbls,t3_kjok2l,"In retrospect, I wish I was 17 and not twice the age when I became self aware. The amazing news is that your brain is still developing and will be until your 25ish. You can absolutely make meaningful changes that will truly transform you! You're not empty, you're only 17, you're just discovering your true self, a blank slate willing to fill it with the best tools to equip you in life. What an amazing journey ahead of you. 
It's painful but this is the best possible scenario, a big congratulations is in order!",t3_kjok2l
ggyjslh,t3_kjok2l,"I feel you and I can relate to feeling empty. I‚Äôm 38 and only now just learning about and accepting my NPD and BPD traits. Even at my age I‚Äôm grateful to realize this about myself, but life could‚Äôve been so different had I started addressing these issues when I was 17. If only I could go back and prevent myself from hurting so many people, but there‚Äôs nothing I can do about the past. Making new friends is not easy at my age compared to when I was young. I fear meeting new people and avoid social interactions because I know how horrible I was. Making things even worse is I live in a small city where lots of people know each other, and I have a reputation. I feel hopeless most days.",t3_kjok2l

ggz31a4,t3_kjok2l,"Yeah I wish I accepted this about myself when I was 17. When I did figure it out I was devastated too. Things have gotten a lot better for me since then (2 years) but it was rough travelling for quite a while for many reasons. You are young though so I expect you'll be far better at changing, adapting, and accepting what you can't change. You got this üëç",t3_kjok2l
ghabb6y,t3_kjok2l,"I feel you. Right now I want to get away from analyzing my personality and behavior. My recent interactions with people in church has triggered my narc tendencies again, esp when i see their ig posts. It's painful, but you can use it to your advantage-hiding your weaknesses so that people don't make fun of you. Trying to be socially confident when you feel like shit. Trudging on even when work feels fucking hard.",t3_kjok2l

ggyoeee,t1_ggy6tu4,"I would very much second this, I might be wrong but I‚Äôm not certain that NPD is usually diagnosed until later in life due to the inherent narcissism and lack of empathy people often have as teenagers and then grow out of once their brain fully develops.",t3_kjok2l
ggyznt0,t1_ggy6tu4,"I have been trying not to self diagnose, but here is the thing. I've always felt like there was something off with me. Not your typical depression and anxiety etc. As I mentioned I felt like I was simply a person with an oscillating self esteem, to the extend of normal people. However the narcissistic traits have fit me like a fine glove. I am trying not to fall prey to much of the misinformation, dehumanizing pwNPD. I have come to realize that this isn't how it truly is, having npd and/or being on the spectrum should'nt be a dehumanizing thing. I am not sure if I am 100% NPD, but I think I lie somewhere in the bad side of the spectrum.",t3_kjok2l
ggz0coq,t1_ggybaap,"I really like this pattern of thought not gonna lie. It does put things in order of the bigger picture. Hope I can find a good therapist or psychiatrist once I am 18 that can help me. I have a great relationship with my current therapist right now though, however her expertise is in child-psychology so I don't know if she even does treatment and or will refer me to someone else. 

Anyways thank you a lot this really helps.",t3_kjok2l
ggz04zs,t1_ggyfbls,"Thank you so much for the encouraging words. Really. I hope to be able to battle this out somehow. I want to believe but sometimes my thoughts get dark and pessimistic, I get hopeless. The misinformation and demonization out there doesn't help either. I always used to have the mindset off ""However bad things may be, we can battle it out"" but this is the only time I feel straight up lost. 
Again venting. Thank you so much, it really means a lot.",t3_kjok2l
ggz0kl0,t1_ggyjslh,"It's okay, I feel your struggle. Better late than never definitely. I can relate to your struggle a lot with reputation as being a teenager things get around in the town very easily. I have heard thought that we should care more about our characters rather than our reputations. And since becoming self-aware you seem to care. And I believe that is the right path.",t3_kjok2l
gh3s8wm,t1_gh3nd1e,"I think you have struck a chord with this one. After these periods of ""self-destruction"" in my attempt to be functional again I become somewhat grandiose. And these motivated attempts to help myself are destined to fail.

I think you are right saying that these moments of sadness are great for self-reflection. And they are. Thing is, every time they happen I can't get myself to learn from it because of the escapism I indulge in. It is tought to battle with feelings so I have numbed them out through surfing, eating, sleeping and the worst of all porn.

I have a pornography addiction. This year I had completely broken free 300 days sober. I am really proud of that. But since becoming self aware I can't get the courage and motivation to treat myself okay. All of my drive is gone. I am severely addicted again and really slacking of on all my studies. I can't get to help myself anymore because this whole npd shit is making me feel really nihilistic. Whenever, I try to do something good for myself I either question it of being narcissistic or having the thought of I am distracting myself from the bigger problem. Combine it with the fact that I can't see a therapist specialized in cluster b's, I have become completely disfunctional.

I used to be one of the most driven, motivated, disciplined, productive people I know. Since becoming self aware I have now come to think of it as a defense mechanism for wanting to be perfect so I could be liked. Don't get me wrong great traits to have but I didn't know they were just common things amongst unaware narcissists.

Sorry I can't provide a solution, but I am going through the same thing as you are and I hope it might be at least comforting hearing my experience.",t3_kjok2l
ggzcz4p,t1_ggz31a4,Thanks for the kind words. You are powerful for accepting your flaws.,t3_kjok2l
ghf0ygg,t1_ghabb6y,"I feel you, specific interactions with people trigger me too. THey trigger my perfectionism, validation seeking and my putting on a mask process. 

Now, here is my confusion dude. Some traits like the one's you mentioned have a positive nudge to them. Specially the one about work. I have found that if I am doing work that I love I used to be  so driven and motivated even if I am not feeling it that day. Moreover I had a lot of social ability and charm, conversation making and even pick-up used to be easy.

Now here is the deal, I have heard that narcissists typically do well in these areas, and they are in fact common traits among us(jfc i can't even say among us anymore). I can see them act as a source of supply, work and validation so I get the motive behind it.

But my question is, those are inherently good traits. Since, becoming self aware I have run into the same problem you have, over-analyzing my behavior. I am constantly asking myself ""Is what I am doing narcissistic?"". So I am in this paralysis, completely not doing what to do with the burden of facing myself. 

I am glad I became self aware but not knowing what to do instead of being charming while at social situations has left me feeling like a sad sack.

I feel paralyzed in general unable to make a lot of moves, because of the dillema in my head. Now I have heard that even this positive behavior is a defense mechanism and I can't disagree.

However are these things we have to give up on, in order to be normal? If they are yeah I will. Can I keep these positive traits and recover? Because they aren't only narcissistic traits, but many normal people have them. I guess the reason is different, as normal people don't have to defend themselves. 

Rambling here again aren't I? Anyways how can you cope with the urge to do these things even if they have a ""positive"" side? And what do you do to replace it. I really am struggling to know when to be charming, when to stfu, when to feel other people.

Spoken like a true narcissist. Jesus I need help for real.",t3_kjok2l
gh23aqf,t1_gh1g98o,Jizz in my mouth daddy yes!,t3_kjok2l
gh4lm2n,t1_gh1g98o,"Lmfao dude. Only thing worse than a narc is a butthurt gimp with a victim mentality. Especially one that wishes the worst on other people. Your outlook on life is fkn brilliant... Goodluck to you.

And OP, I‚Äôm 23. Recently had the realisation and it sucks man! Guilt, shame, grappling with the fact your a shit person. I had to be stabilised on antipsychotics it was so bad. But having this collapse so early in life can be a blessing in disguise. I‚Äôve semi isolated myself except for a few close friends, my family and work. Slowly I‚Äôm developing empathy and it‚Äôs the greatest feeling ever. 

Immerse yourself in things you enjoy and spend time with your family if they‚Äôre a good influence like mine. Slowly you‚Äôll develop a sense of self and begin to be more authentic. Your gonna have to feel a lot of pain and feel a sense of uncertainty like nothing else. You‚Äôre effectively rebuilding your core beliefs and outlook on life. It‚Äôll get better though and you‚Äôll start feeling truely human. 

As a lot of people have mentioned 17 is so young and the change in people from 17-23 can be immense. Just do you and once the shame etc. passes focus on being authentic and working out your own set of values. Everyone has their own set of codes, what do u want to live by?

Some friends might have liked you because of your positive narc attributes (humour, charm, wit etc) and they‚Äôll miss that which is also a weird thing to process. JUST BE AUTHENTIC. 

You‚Äôve got this dude, it‚Äôs hard but rewarding and you‚Äôll be a better person for your loved ones. Goodluck!",t3_kjok2l
ggyzw7n,t1_ggyoeee,"Yeah you are right. Legally I can't even see a psychiatrist yet, only a psychologist working with CBT skills I think. So an official diagnosis is out of the question. Most of the things I have found out about myself are through my so called soul-searching (reading how much of a horrible person I am in narcissistic abuse subs)",t3_kjok2l
ggyow9m,t1_ggyoeee,"Exactly. I‚Äôm also only 17 just like OP and had some questionable traits a few years ago, but I feel like the person I am now today is drastically different and I don‚Äôt identify with the majority of those traits. It makes me sad there aren‚Äôt more young people who challenge their undesired traits through self-realization and therapeutic techniques which I believe can completely change certain aspects of your behavior/thought processes. Albeit, I think that issue has more to do with how mental health practitioners treat personality disorders as opposed to the people actually experiencing undesired traits. ‚òπÔ∏è",t3_kjok2l
gha308q,t1_ggyznt0,That oscillating self esteem is literally the definition of narcistic supply. Either getting it and your good or lack of it and plummeting. Just thought I'd point it out took me along time to finally see this.,t3_kjok2l

gh5ukcs,t1_gh4lm2n,"Thanks a ton dude. You have no idea how encouraging this is right now. It is really tough for me man at this moment. It feels hopeless, from many angles for me.

And yeah I do agree with you. I have come to realise that having a value system is so important. I find myself only needing a small glimpse of hope to survive another day. I truly believe that evil is just good gone bad, even if I can't convince myself. 

We are our worst critics after all.

I am glad that things are getting better for you man and I wish you the best, thanks a lot for the support.",t3_kjok2l
gh2lnyx,t1_ggyzw7n,"Yeah I wouldn‚Äôt do that lol. When you realise you have narcissistic traits, it can be very painful and create a lot of self blame for things you‚Äôve done in the past and for mistakes you‚Äôve made perhaps as a result of the self centredness and lack of empathy that can come with the disorder. You can use that shit as a catalyst for change but don‚Äôt dwell on what you did too much as it‚Äôs counterintuitive. We all do the best with what we‚Äôve got at the time and if you‚Äôve had the awareness to have self realisation at your age you will be fine as long as you learn to control it.

I don‚Äôt mean to sound offensive or patronising when I say teenagers and young adults often lack empathy, or total awareness of the impact of their actions on others. The problem comes when you‚Äôre still having basic human values dawn on you when you‚Äôre forty. If you do have the beginning of some of the long term traits now you‚Äôve got so much of a better chance of rooting that shit out, understanding and controlling it than if you‚Äôd realised much later in life.

I think in reality what happens is when we have the disorder (to whatever degree we do have it) we stay in stuck in teenage or even earlier child like phases and fail to develop in the same way as others because of the defence mechanisms we use. I think this applies to all personality disorders, not just NPD but what comes with them all is a reckoning at some point at another. Part of developing empathy is feeling and acknowledging what we‚Äôve done to others. You can‚Äôt get through to the other side without going though this bit first unfortunately but you can only heal and grow from acknowledged issues. 

I‚Äôm not talking doing some my name is Earl type shit here btw (I tried that, it failed miserably) and it was still all about me but just an internal acknowledgement and a commitment to yourself to try better.",t3_kjok2l
ghdpk8s,t1_gha308q,"This is a really good point, thanks. Took me years to realise that my mood swings were not bipolar or something similar but directly related to my interactions with others and how they were perceiving me.",t3_kjok2l
ghf1yit,t1_gha308q,"I see I haven't thought of it. That explains why I feel like complete and utter shit when I give up my disciplines. 

Normal people feel bad as well, but they do not get depressive episodes from it. Let's say I am unable to discipline myself and have the willpower to do the things I need. I start hating myself, feeling like a failure etc. 

I happen to say that the happiest time of my life was this quarantine in April because I was able to exercise and write on my book everyday, while reading and stuyding in the mean time.
I found that, that hapiness carried over to my interactions since it was the most fun I have had with my gf. 

You know what the worst part is with this shit. Becoming self aware just made me realize that my happiest period of my life was the on were I was gettin the most supply (If working hard could be considered supply). I feel like my perception of the world was an illusion jesus. 

And here is the thing. How can you distuinguish being passionate and driven toward goals, form chasing career supply. Because a lot of traits and symptoms of narcissism would be positive things for almost every person.

However really liked your perspective on the oscillating self esteem havent thought of it like this. But I feel lost I don't know.",t3_kjok2l
gh5tp7p,t1_gh585ua,"Yeah, I have come to intuitively know that instant gratification is a mask for long term harm, yet I still struggle with it. 

Even if it isn't something particularly harmful, it can still make some go numb for a little. Just last night I was having this high about thinking purchasing a new espresso machine. Shopping does it to me aswell man.

Also, great insight on how narcissism tries to prevent you from becoming self aware. Never thought of it this way. Kind of like a disease trying to hide itself and doctors cant find it",t3_kjok2l
gh8u0a2,t1_gh5ukcs,"Sorry to hear your struggling atm mate. It might seem like there‚Äôs no way out but you‚Äôll be surprised to see how far you get in 6 months.

You‚Äôll slowly gain insight into the false narratives you tell yourself and the cognitive biases you possess. Promise you‚Äôll be better for this experience.

gh3r3km,t1_gh2lnyx,"Really insightful comment dude, really helped.

(Interesting side-note my name is Earl was adapted here in Greece given a different name).

You have given me food for thought here. I have thought about going back and saying sorry to a past girlfriend of mine, since becoming self aware. 

I had lovebombed her so much to the point where I told her I loved her and I became the first person she said ""I love you"" to. I clearly did not and I was just in the lovebombing phase(completely unaware of it two years ago).

I had broken up with her after three months because I said I didn't feel things. I do give my self some slack because I was 15 at the time and completely unaware, but know that I know how hurtful I can be damn.

I had broken up with her because I didn't feel any attachment to her. It seemed really puzzling at the time, the fact that she was hurt. My thought proccess was like ""I did you a favor for not wasting any of your time with someone who didn't feel the same way"". I still find this to be true, but at the time I couldn't even fathom the fact that she was hurt. And I found it stupid of her reaching out and accused her attempts of trying to work it out as ""guilt tripping me"". 

I think it was my lack of empathy at it's finest. Man you have struck a gold here, getting me to self reflect I forgot a lot of shit. Now that I think about it this girl was giving me so much validation. So many compliments, so much praise. I don't know if it is love bombing necesarilly because she didn't drop it while in the relationship. She still tried to work to keep the romance alive, while I did barely anything. 

And now, since becoming self aware, I have thought to say sorry. But if I am being 100% honest, this will be for myself(not a bad thing, but I am not that good of a person yet). I can't really put my finger on it, maybe I would like validation again? Most importantly, I think it will cause her to hurt a lot. And I don't want to. She is a great person now that I think of it and it would do more harm than good. 

I feel horrible, she definitely did not deserve this treatment. Thanks for the opportunity for self-reflection.",t3_kjok2l

ghf2pwm,t1_gh8u0a2,"You know it feels like an illusion has been shattered man. It feels like going crazy not knowing what is authentic and what is just the disorder? Am I the disorder? I want to believe that you define who you are, but this shit hit me the hardest than anything has in my life.

I find myself questioning every single thing I do. My values, my thoughts, my actions, my motives. How can you differentiate between real things and supply seeking. 

I am so glad that you are making progress. If you think about it, everyone is worth getting better. We aren't monsters we are people with illness. If we get better the world becomes a tiny bit better. Not only us but our surroundings, all of our closest's people's life's get a bit better.

gh3suyp,t1_gh3r3km,"My realisation eventually was that by going back to anyone we‚Äôve hurt too early, we cause way more damage, both to ourselves and them. I get the ultra logic, like it‚Äôs best for you in the long term and yeah, it takes a level of detachment to think something like that that most other people don‚Äôt have. However, I wonder if this will be your reaction to everyone or there are some you cant break the attraction for? They do exist, even sometimes for the most impaired of us and really are the ones we need to be careful with because we will trash everything out of reaction and regret it deeply.

This is very terrible but there are people I hurt so badly, and from what I understand, almost irreparably to the point where only distance from me can help.",t3_kjok2l
gh6co8i,t1_gh5zdg8,"What you said about fighting back to open up to my therapist is really true for me aswell. I feel physically stuck in the moments that I need to be completely honest. In retrospect, if I were more honest therapy would be easier and shorter. But it is exactly like you said, unable to pop open the hood and find the shit inside.

I also have a hard time even mentioning the word narcissist because I don't feel qualified to say it to a proffesional. I don't wanna be all like ""Hey wassup I'm going to tell you how to treat me"". Or at least that is my rationalization.

I have found most of my negative traits over the internet. I know I need to let my therapist know how I truly feel, but it is like I word it like it is normal. I am not lying, but it does feel like I am manipulating how I phrase my problems and concerns. 

Moreover I don't want to mention about the things I read on the internet because to be honest there is a lot of misinformation out there. And I have this fear of her telling me ""Who do you think you are to tell me what you have"". I know she won't, and it ties in to what you said that we think that even the therapist will reject us.

I want to find the courage to tell her about what I read. But I am really struggling. I am giving it my best. I understood that going to therapy isn't about getting a nice pat on the back, but I need to be challenged. But I am aware of my own fragility and how if something mildly bad happens, I won't be able to handle it.",t3_kjok2l
gh3u00g,t1_gh3suyp,"Yeah I feel that. Sometimes I get the feeling that yeah they should run from me, I will only do harm. It gets me thinking on occasion ""What if the people on narcissistic abuse subs are right and we are in fact monsters to run away from""

On retrospect we aren't and the whole making out people with personality disorders to be monsters is a whole problematic behavior in and of itself. 

Really self-isolating isn't any good for anybody. I do feel a lot of times ""Holy fuck I should dissapear of the face of the earth before I do more damage"", which I am guessing is somewhat what you are feeling.

Look it is though as shit, it really is. Just know that you have inherent goodness in you. That people by their making are good, shit just happens in the way that hurts them. And hurt people hurt people. I use this proccess a lot to cope with these kind of self-destructing thoughts. I hope they help you.",t3_kjok2l
gh6l910,t1_gh6co8i,[deleted],t3_kjok2l
gh41r2o,t1_gh3u00g,"Before we‚Äôre self aware? People probably should run. I don‚Äôt think we want to hurt people, or necessarily go out of our way to do it, it just happens because we will do whatever is required to save ourselves. As you say, most of us are here inherently good. We wouldn‚Äôt end up here if we weren‚Äôt. The problem we have are the people still out there doing harm (and the fact sometimes that‚Äôs still me and probably other people here too).",t3_kjok2l
ghf4hsf,t1_gh6l910,"Yeah you are right. A good therapist should handle the thing in a proffesional manner. Moreover I am okay with being misinformed and corrected. In fact I'd love to patch up any distortions. I am just afraid of her telling me stfu what are you talking about. I know that she won't, she she is a professional but hey irrational fears are irrational for a reason.

Yeah narcisssism and NPD has become a buzzword, and many people on the internet use it synonimously as monster. 

I search the internet because finding the terminology can help me name the monster I am facing. Name it and tame it (Except I can't tame it lol).

I could be using it to avoid opening up to my darkest side tbh. Cause if that shit opens up oh god it'll hurt.",t3_kjok2l
gh4wi5p,t1_gh41r2o,"Yeah you make a good point. I really struggle with this thought to be honest. Jumping between ""I have inherent good"" and ""People should run"". Have you found a way to deal with it?",t3_kjok2l
gh62w16,t1_gh4wi5p,"So this is sort of like splitting on ourselves I guess. You probably already know about splitting but if not basically it‚Äôs something that happens with BPD a lot but also with NPD. Essentially we haven‚Äôt yet developed beyond the stage we we can see people as an integrated whole, both good and bad. We either idolise and adore, or hate and are disgusted, there is no grey and we flip between the two depending on reactions to circumstances.

Have I found a way to deal with it? Sort of. I mean just knowing what is happening and that we are flipping on ourselves or other people helps. I think that making ourselves real for want of a better description also helps. Like actually doing stuff (whether it‚Äôs our first instinct or not) that someone as awesome as we think we are would do. 

I think DBT is about learning to hold conflicting emotions? I‚Äôve never had it but I presume that‚Äôs about ourselves as well as others and might be worth a go?

I don‚Äôt do well with this to be honest. Even years later if I‚Äôm criticised I can fall into months of depression. I got passed over for a job I was acting up to because I was seen as being arrogant and too direct and months later I‚Äôm still ill and trying to recover. Actually that‚Äôs another point, managing out stress levels. I can integrate much more when I‚Äôm relaxed, stress beings out the absolute worst in me and I‚Äôm now 40 and can still struggle to control it at bad times. 

The only way I have really survived is through brutal self reflection and converting very painful realisations into action. Like yeah I can be an asshole but usually once I realise I will stop and try to change. The other thing is that I will almost never listen to advice. I only learn from pain and embarrassing mistakes. I just trash my way along until eventually something bad happens to me and/or other people as a result and then (maybe) I might reflect, have another basic human realisation and go about trying to fix my ways. I guess you‚Äôll probably have people who spot you doing things and try to help so maybe if you trust them try to listed and act on what they are saying before the shit hits the fan rather than after. I will do this occasionally but it‚Äôs hard.

 The other thing I‚Äôd say is that I‚Äôve never had therapy or been formally diagnosed. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd meet the NPD or BPD criteria now so very much take what I say with a pinch of salt.",t3_kjok2l
gh6bbt9,t1_gh62w16,"Unfortunaly, I am familiar with splitting and did a lot of damage to my relationship because of it. In fact it was one of the first things my therapist told me about. Yeah I really struggle with it and with object constancy as well. 

Splitting is one of many distorted thinking patterns. My therapist gave me this thing which kind of help to calm me down.

http://www.pacwrc.pitt.edu/curriculum/313_MngngImpctTrmtcStrssChldWlfrPrfssnl/hndts/HO15_ThnkngAbtThnkng.pdf

Surely it helps put things in order for me. But sometimes trying to help myself think in a manner of someone with self esteem, takes too much willpower. It really feels like, I need to use willpower to control myself from hurting other people and me.

When I feel depleted, all that willpower is out of the window and shit gets bad, with the splitting on myself starting to arise firstly. 
The first thing I get is bad thoughts about how worthless I am. I have tried to simply dismiss them, from a cognitive perspective but it didn't seem to work out after all. I logically see why they have no value and are distorted but they seem to stem from some kind of trauma I am unable to confront. 

I've heard many people with BPD have had great success with DBT as you say, but I haven't tried it myself neither. 

Sure splitting does play a huge role in my bad self talk not going to lie, but surely there is something deeper which I can't quite explain.",t3_kjok2l
gh6clb7,t1_gh6bbt9,"Oh that sheet lol, yeah still using all of those with relative frequency lol. Do you find that you have a lot of negativity you‚Äôre trying to contain? Like my partner for example seems to struggle with dark negative thoughts about anything and everything (particularly including himself) and is much more likely to let them out when very stressed, depressed or tired.

In the past  I suffered with very negative and repetitive self talk. Like almost a script I‚Äôd internalised. Just over and over I‚Äôd re-examine the mistakes I‚Äôd made and the mortifying experiences I‚Äôd had and loathe myself for my part in them. ‚ÄòKill yourself‚Äô was on a pretty much constant loop and when it got really bad, I would self harm to try to get it out and get past it.

I started to take anti depressants and that helped with the loop a lot. I can usually pull it back when I‚Äôm going down that path now.

I dunno, is any of this sounding familiar?",t3_kjok2l

Yeah I have experienced some negative persisting patterns in my self thought. I find this specific one to be really interesting in fact, yet quite terryfing.

So here is it. In my original post, I said like I feel like faulty product. This is what causes the most harmful self talk in me. And it manifests this way, whenever I am trying to good to myself.

I can't shake the feeling that I am unsaveable, faulty by design. When I use CBT tactics like the sheet above, there is a voice that tells me ""Yeah you can try your best to be a normal person, but no matter how much you try you will never have normal self esteem, so have fun trying to cope"".

Now this fucking sucks even worse because it is causing me cognitive dissonance, contradicting my thought that everybody has inherent worth and value.

To summarize, attempts to get better are regarded as cheap tricks by my brain for some reason.

P.S. I was in a very fun self-destructive cycle these 2 days yay",t3_kjok2l
