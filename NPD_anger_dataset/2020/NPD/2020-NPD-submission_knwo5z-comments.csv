ghnmxb5,t3_knwo5z,"i also had a breakthrough in life similar to this very recently! i‚Äôm really happy for you, just figured i‚Äôd share this little insight because maybe it can help someone else as much as it‚Äôs been helping me.

talk to yourself like you‚Äôd talk to a friend in a hard/sad time. we can be really really mean to ourselves and convince ourselves were this horrible person, when in reality we can be whoever we wanna be. don‚Äôt let the narcissistic shit define you. we‚Äôve put up so many walls to protect ourselves from feeling at all, but we still have that good/happy/natural stuff inside of us, it‚Äôs just buried and we gotta dig it out. this is how we‚Äôve learned to get through life without breaking, but it‚Äôs okay to break sometimes and take everything in. life is beautiful like that. all we can do is be better than we were tomorrow ‚úåüèº",t3_knwo5z

ghne7t8,t3_knwo5z,"Everyone wants their partners to be real. But if she prefers your ""broken"" self, doesn't it make you wonder if she is somehow trying to keep you down? The ideal scenario would be if she accepted you now, while also pushing you to genuinely grow and turn your mask into your actual self. Those two are not mutually exclusive. Perhaps your being vulnerable is her supply and she gets off of being the only one who sees you. It's an ego feeder and ensures that she is irreplaceable. Inverted narcs look like plain codependents, but they actually gain supply from being needed, supportive, and being a good supply themselves. Maybe she fears that if you genuinely grow into your best self, the line between your inner/outward self will disappear, and she won't be special anymore because everyone else sees your real, amazing self. Gone is the dependent, weak, insecure version of you that only she had access to.",t3_knwo5z

Thanks for the kind words, they mean the world to me.",t3_knwo5z
ghu6s50,t1_ghnmxb5,"Such an amazing way to go about it. First read it in Jordan Peterson's 12 rules for life. 

I am so happy that you had a breakthrough and improving. We are all worth it man.",t3_knwo5z
ghu6vuf,t1_gho1qlr,"Thanks a lot mate. I feel way better these 2 days than I've felt in 3 months.

There is room for improvement for all of us. It always gets better.",t3_knwo5z
ghu7cts,t1_ghp1wt6,"Fuck this sounds so bad I am sorry for that.

I am struggling to not use people's issues against them. Sometimes I feel like when I would argue, I would fire cheap and ugly shots with their flaws.

I am trying to cut this behavior, completely. It is disgusting. I am so sorry that this has happened to you. 

I believe that the people who do it are the ones who are afraid that something similar could happen to them. At least for me that is why I am not able to open up easily, and I why I get defensive.

You are a great person keep fighting everyday :)",t3_knwo5z
ghu6z1s,t1_ghocmw7,Yeah it is. I am still not perfect not going to lie. I don't really know what is the disorder and what isn't but I feel okay right now.,t3_knwo5z
ghu7oy0,t1_ghrie2d,"Mate I am so sorry but I do not want to give any advice, because I simply do not know the right thing here to say. I can offer a few kind words though.

You are a great person, inherently. Never let someone make you believe otherwise.",t3_knwo5z
ghu8aeb,t1_ghne7t8,"Yeah you what I have thought of this perspective a lot. But what happened with me was so bad. I had this attitude of she doesn't love me nor care for me to succeed and improve.

See never showed me or told me these things. I was just projecting my lack of self worth into her. My own battles inside my head. 

The projection on my end got REALLLY BAD trust me. 

I really appreciate your perspective and I even thought of it being this way for such a long time until I realized that I was the asshole.

I'll post an update soon tbh.

Thanks a lot for your time, appreciate it.",t3_knwo5z
ghn4cl9,t1_ghn0fmh,"No dude, they arent. I am sorry you had this bad experience. 

Not going to lie I have some kind of internalized misogyny in me, which I've been trying to get rid of. I am pretty sure porn addiction did it to me.

Look mate, I have went through some posts of your profile because I was curious of the guy who was harassing me and other people here so much.

I am not going to mention all these things that already get you down. 

I'll just tell you that you can chose the better path. You can avoid that resentment you hold. I'm really sorry that some people have hurt you, a lot.

You are not a bad person mate, you are just another example of ""hurt people hurt people"".

There is a better life out there, than this misery and resentment. You don't have to suffer so much man. I feel how painful some of the shit you are going through could be, because I have struggled with them myself. You are worth better than this mate. 

I wish you a great year mate.",t3_knwo5z
ghna751,t1_ghn0fmh,"This is true projection, bravo",t3_knwo5z
ghndjgc,t1_ghn0fmh,Yikes,t3_knwo5z
ghuiwh9,t1_ghu8aeb,"It's just important to see things from all angles, not just from the angle of comfort. From your post, you seem aware enough so that's good. I like making sure if I'm actually projecting or not. 

Broken people gravitate towards each other. Usually healthy people when dating can sense toxicity subconsciously, and steer away from Cluster B's. Those who have their own inner dysfunction, on the other hand, become more attracted when the toxicity is shown to them. It doesn't have to be a sinister, conscious thing like the worst case scenario I talked about. It's usually subconscious. That's why some guys who are more self-aware of their flaws say things like ""I don't go after women who like me, because that means their standards are so low"". 

Keep self-examining. Even if you don't figure it out, the doubt itself keeps you from going full-narc. 

Peace",t3_knwo5z
