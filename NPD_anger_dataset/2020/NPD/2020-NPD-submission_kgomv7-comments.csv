ggk95jd,t3_kgomv7,"I have never been diagnosed with NPD.  Was diagnosed with PDNOS about 12 years ago, along with a dissociative disorder.  The therapist elaborated, when I asked her for more information, and said that I was ""narcissistically wounded and fragmented.""  I have two ""parts"" that seems NPD-ish, although I don't usually act out that way.

I was happily married for 24 years and then my husband died and I couldn't move on, so I think your concern is valid and it's probably good that you are trying to address it now, because you never know.

I found Heinz Kohut's ideas on my owne and like them very much.

The last therapy ended badly, too.  It was a trauma specialist and she seemed to understand the fragmentation/dissociation but not the wounding.  I tried to talk about Kohut's ideas but she wouldn't consider it and that was one of the factors that led to the therapy ending.

I had been depending on therapy to get me better after my husband died.  That apparently wasn't working.  When the trauma therapist terminated me saying she ""didn't have the emotional resources to continue"",  that resulted in an experience like you describe when you took the separation.  Abandonment, terror, fury, destitute loss -- and loss of a sense of self-cohesion.  Six months after that a memory from my childhood emerged, of similar feelings.  They are so awful I had learned how to dissociate or defend against them -- understandably!

Eventually, on my own, I think I have traced it back to a time when my mother -- clearly a selfobject at the time -- ""failed"" me when I was 3 and she had to leave me along going into the operating room at a hospital.  She couldn't help it but the experience was traumatic nonetheless.  She was also not very reliable otherwise, so the trauma never ""healed"" I guess.

As I understand Kohut's theory, when parents are ""good enough"" children weather small disappointments and eventually the loss of someone we depend on and are close to -- even to the point of being (like a) selfobject is sad and requires readjusting but does not destroy the person's sense of self.

But for a child -- and going back to my memory when I was 3 -- there isn't a clear distinction between the selfobject and the self.  The selfobject aspect of the relationship was gone.

So then, when my late husband was gone, I had never developed a real independent person, just someone who fulfilled roles and tried to live by the rules.

Bottom line -- it seems unlikely that the separation from your current partner is the original issue.  But -- I never found a therapist who understood or could help me, so I . . .I have tried to do it myself.  I can identify ""self-object"" feelings of grandiosity, idealization, and twinship.  What was most missing in my life was twinship, and because of another trauma and sense-of-self crash when I was 13 I stopped making friends in adolescence, which I think can be another kind of twinship.  In recent years, I have lucked into some friendships with other women, in a support group, and that has helped a lot.  It is not an easy thing to put together in adulthood instead of childhood.  But what are the choices?  ;)

This has been very long and me-focused.  But I do hope it helps you feel somewhat less alone.",t3_kgomv7
ggjjake,t3_kgomv7,"This sounds like the kind of experience best talked through with a professional - identifying the distinct aspects of what caused this 'unravelling' seems like a great avenue for developing insight into yourself.

It's ok to not know how - that's how everything you end up knowing starts out!",t3_kgomv7
