ggx3i3o,t3_kjjv2l,"Just how bratty I am. I get irritated real fast, complain a lot... I have to hide a lot of these qualities around people who can’t tolerate it.",t3_kjjv2l
ggxe8tx,t3_kjjv2l,"I refuse to take the blame for things. For a long time I used to think that ""I did X because at the time I thought Y was true"" removed most of my responsibility for the consequences of my actions even though I was wrong in thinking ""Y was true"" in the first place.

In books and other forms of media I was always amazed at people accepting the blame for something when there was a valid excuse.

Thinking ""It's not me. I could never be wrong."", ""Don't dislike me because of this."" concurrently.",t3_kjjv2l
ggxco32,t3_kjjv2l,"How happy I will get when misfortunes/sickness strike people around me. A few months ago, my cousin lost most of his saving in a scam, and I couldn't help but grinned ear to ear and was in high spirit for the whole week. 

It's really hard to hide my Schadenfreude, especially if people suffer misfortunes heavily and unexpectedly.",t3_kjjv2l
ggx61s0,t3_kjjv2l,"I get really irritable and aggressive when drunk or sleep deprived. Otherwise, the very nature of this disorder makes me hyper-focused on making a good impression, so any ""red flags"" get fixed as soon as I become aware of them. I'm sure there are some still, but you'd have to ask the people around me.",t3_kjjv2l
ggxhe69,t3_kjjv2l,How long I’m able to go without saying a single word to anyone. The only times I really speak when I’m not spoken to first is when I’m gaming.,t3_kjjv2l
ggxnl7c,t3_kjjv2l,I don't do this anymore but i only stopped recently. Talking shit instead of confronting people. Honestly if some of my friends knew what I said and still were my friends I'd probably die on spot.,t3_kjjv2l
ggz5x2d,t3_kjjv2l,My literal homicidal streak,t3_kjjv2l
ggzi49p,t3_kjjv2l,"My extremely low (emotional) empathy, especially in negative situations that don't regard me. I am expected to be sad for them, inside I am completely indifferent or even happy if the situation might turn out useful for my own well being.

It seems that I'm very good at masking though. Fake it till you make it.",t3_kjjv2l
ggydqsp,t3_kjjv2l,I don't really react to negative events. Also I lie about the way I feel to make it seem like my reactions are stronger to those said events.,t3_kjjv2l
ggx58vd,t1_ggx3i3o,"I complain more than any reasonable person I know personally but I'm not concerned by this because I'm usually fair.

Example: I think it's rude that my niece doesn't respond to my morning greetings when I run into her in the morning but later expect me to be chatty with her. She's 10. I have told her this. Now, if she didn't have any such expectations it wouldn't be worth much for me.

Do you have examples of what you complained / want to complain about that people found / might find bratty?",t3_kjjv2l
ggyd8kt,t1_ggx3i3o,"Ditto, I’m so whiney. I used to be able to hide it better, but when my mom died 2 years ago, I could feel it getting noticeably worse and I could notice other people noticing it as well. I also talk about people behind their backs if I have issues with them. I also display my jealousy on accident sometimes.",t3_kjjv2l
ggyecpw,t1_ggxe8tx,"I remember the very first time I heard someone say “you’re right, I was wrong” and I was utterly flabbergasted. It was when I was about 25 or 25 and in a healthcare setting and I was so surprised. Nobody every admitted to being wrong in my household 😂",t3_kjjv2l
ggzxmwq,t1_ggxe8tx,"Nah.  ""I did X because I thought Y was true at the time"" is valid af. Only thing is after you realize Y isn't  true it's probably best to make a change. Believe it or not most people do ""X when why is true"" insert whatever there that you want. The issue is what made you think Y was true when it wasn't and how you make amends for actions based on a faulty assumption.",t3_kjjv2l
ggxeofx,t1_ggxe8tx,Is it hard to pretend you take the blame? I have moments where saying I'm sorry is particularly hard but I always thank myself for saying it in retrospect.,t3_kjjv2l
ggyzmy3,t1_ggxe8tx,"Why doesn't it remove most of the responsibility? Explain like I'm a narcissist, please",t3_kjjv2l
ggxs6yx,t1_ggxco32,[deleted],t3_kjjv2l
gh0tojk,t1_ggxco32,"My n-dad had the same thing. Once, when I was a kid, he tattled to the landlord about the neighbors dog, they ended up calling animal services to take the dog away. The neighbor kids were crying when this was happening but my dad just stood there with the biggest smirk, enjoying it all.",t3_kjjv2l
ggxe0ln,t1_ggxco32,Is this someone you care about / like?,t3_kjjv2l
ggydsmr,t1_ggxco32,"I’m like this when it comes to people I have grudges against or when I warned someone about something and they do it anyways. I’ll feel bad, but I still have that “I knew it” or “I told you so” mindset.",t3_kjjv2l
ggyeob5,t1_ggx61s0,I’m the same when when tired and drunk. I quit this summer because of how I act when I drink but I’m still problematic when tired. And I’m not able to make good impressions all the time so most times I’m just ultra quiet. It’s not a good impression but at least it’s not a horrible one.,t3_kjjv2l
ggye2dm,t1_ggxnl7c,"I have this issue, too. My ex left me because I talked hella abusive shit to him during our last fight (that I started out of nowhere). Nobody wants to be around someone who thinks that way about them. In my defense, my parents always talked to themselves and to me like that so I think my skin is just thicker because of it and I end up surprised when other people’s isn’t.",t3_kjjv2l
ggzy0r1,t1_ggz5x2d,.... l-literal?,t3_kjjv2l
ggyqws5,t1_ggydqsp,"It doesn't count as a red flag unless you mess up your lies, though",t3_kjjv2l
ggxg4c1,t1_ggxeofx,"I have phases during the day/week when I'm particularly self-aware and I realise what I'm doing. At those times it's not hard at all.

At other times it doesn't occur to me immediately that it could be my fault so I get defensive and argue. Often by the time I realise what's happening I've already doubled down so much that it's very very difficult to pretend and impossible to be sincere.

The person that I was dating up until 6 months ago had medically diagnosed anxiety. These arguments were hell for both of us. She was the only person that could even pretend to apologize to because of how close we were. Unfortunately she could see through the pretence and often thought I was patronizing her and things would get worse.",t3_kjjv2l
ggz0g4x,t1_ggyzmy3,"I'll try my best, though do understand that this is something I constantly have struggle with and often times I do believe that the responsibility is removed. So my explanation might not be the best.

The fact that you had a valid (valid at least to you) reasoning to do X does make you better in a way than someone that did X because they wanted to. But, this doesn't mean you don't have any responsibility at all. As people with NPD I think we tend to believe that blame and fault is binary, but it isn't.

An example might help my ramblings. Police officer A shoots an unarmed man because he thought he saw a gun, but infact there was no gun. Police officer B shoots an unarmed man because he wanted to. A is better than B in every sense but A still has some blame to bare for the pain and hardship of the unarmed man that was shot.",t3_kjjv2l
ggyrihz,t1_ggxs6yx,"Envy and schadenfreude are very similar and are linked emotional states. Covert narcisssists usually suffer envy due  to their inferiority complex (for my case, I've always feel like everyone is above me/ that I'm the lowest scum on Earth).

I'm sure I'm not a psychopath as I have intense empathy for animals/disabled people and other fellows NPD.",t3_kjjv2l
gh1k7k7,t1_gh0tojk,"Uh-oh! I have a soft spot for animals so I could never harm any animals but I do feel happy creating chaos and seeing others suffer metally.

(I'm working on toning it down and have more empathy for people around me)",t3_kjjv2l
ggysf4n,t1_ggxe0ln,"Yeah, he's been very kind to me and I don't hate/dislike him at all. 
To be honest, I'm kind of indifferent about anyone but my siblings and parent.",t3_kjjv2l
ggyn2gl,t1_ggydsmr,"Then you are way better than me, I'm so affected by Schadenfreude to the point of turning people's misfortunes into my main supplies. The only people that are immune to it are my parents and siblings.",t3_kjjv2l
ggypfut,t1_ggyeob5,">It’s not a good impression but at least it’s not a horrible one.

Very reasonable, if a tad depressing.  But have you ever considered that those who are not impressed don't matter anyway?",t3_kjjv2l
gh0fcy4,t1_ggzy0r1,o_O,t3_kjjv2l
gh16ali,t1_ggz0g4x,Thank you. It's weird how much this makes sense yet doesn't register on the emotional level.... I'll have to give it more thought.,t3_kjjv2l
ggyrjau,t1_ggyrihz,"Hi the lowest scum on earth).

, I'm dad.",t3_kjjv2l
ggynabt,t1_ggyn2gl,"At least your parents and siblings are immune, there are times when my family isn’t... and that makes me worse IMO ☹️",t3_kjjv2l
ggypj2i,t1_ggypfut,"I’m so neurotic, everyone matters to me :(",t3_kjjv2l
ggyshb4,t1_ggypfut,">But have you ever considered that those who are not impressed don't matter anyway?

That's NPD talking. Aren't we here to get better and get over that way of seeing things?

Or maybe you were being cheeky and I missed it because it's in text idk..",t3_kjjv2l
ggysxbm,t1_ggyrjau,"Nah... I told my dad I'm a narcissist and he flat out denied it, telling me I'm perfect and never think of myself like that again.",t3_kjjv2l
gh3ohls,t1_ggyrjau,Bad bot,t3_kjjv2l
ggypjqu,t1_ggypj2i,"Hi so neurotic, everyone matters to me :(, I'm dad.",t3_kjjv2l
ggyv2k5,t1_ggyshb4,"Deliberately ambiguous, just like my feelings on getting over NPD",t3_kjjv2l
