ghdk9gs,t3_km79ok,"Well here's a hack: you strengthen your relationships with other people when you celebrate their achievements. You want strong relationships, so celebrate like crazy. This is one of the first skills I worked on developing and I really think I get above average levels of happiness now from hearing others' success (pruning friends helped). 

Here is a popular article about it. 

https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2006-20034-008

Not sure how well it stood up over time, but it spells out the idea.

EDIT: How to celebrate: Do banana lips and say ""wow that's really great I'm so happy for you. So wow, like tell me more about that!"" - no but for real, gain a reputation of being the one to organise celebration gifts and dinners. Every achievement in your friend group should a expect a celebration. At birthdays, make sure to list off and mention all the achievements of your friends. Master this with friends and it will bleed out to workmates and neighbours etc",t3_km79ok
ghd4esx,t3_km79ok,Try to think about it in terms of how you might react when you accomplish a goal and expect others to react. I understand you have cognitive empathy. Use it! You may very well not remember your own reactions for when others donâ€™t praise you for accomplishing your own goals that youâ€™d been working towards. The most fascinating and substantial concepts to understand are egosyntonic versus egodystonic. Your own excessive narcissism makes you egosyntonic towards anger and resentment for when others donâ€™t celebrate you and it makes you anxious when thinking about how you could possibly react when you donâ€™t celebrate the expressed achievements of others. Thereâ€™s progress here. This post is the proof in the pudding.,t3_km79ok
ghdtpsu,t3_km79ok,"I deal with this too but it manifests differently for me.

My immediate instinctive response is ""That's amazing but..."" followed with one of ""I saw..."", ""I know..."", ""I did..."", etc, depending on the situation.

I'm currently taking things one step at a time and focussing on stopping at ""That's amazing"" currently. I hope you can get to a place where you can genuinely celebrate someone else's accomplishment and I hope I can join you there someday.",t3_km79ok
ghefsv3,t3_km79ok,"Does your discomfort come from not having had that positive reinforcement from childhood or even in adulthood? 

If so, it can feel really awkward to give it to others. Itâ€™s just like a muscle you have to exercise. The more you practice and do something, even in tiny increments, the more comfortable you will be with doing so. 

Does it feel like giving someone else praise is uncomfortable because it feels like you are being vulnerable? Being happy is still an emotion and it can feel scary to share it with others because maybe they might take it away? I donâ€™t know, maybe Iâ€™m reaching. Just thinking thoughts here. 

Being happy for others can feel super foreign if you havenâ€™t experienced others being happy for you. Have you ever experienced that? If so, what did it feel like? Good? Or weird? And why?",t3_km79ok
gheln0i,t3_km79ok,"Itâ€™s really hard to detach pleasure at success for others from my own sense of failure in not achieving what they have unless itâ€™s in a totally different area or Iâ€™m on stable ground myself.

Do you actually want to feel it or are you happy enough with looking like youâ€™re pleased for them for now?",t3_km79ok
ghef4fg,t1_ghdk9gs,Unfortunately it seems as though you have to pay to view this document. Is there a way around that?,t3_km79ok
ghd58le,t1_ghd4esx,"Ah shit. Well that's just another layer to the problem. Cause I rarely feel accomplished. There are things that I want and attain through planned effort. But few things that I would celebrate. Much less want other people celebrating. The extent that I celebrate is an internal ""huzzah. Alright onwards.""

Thanks for the positive reinforcement though ðŸ˜‰

Edit: ah crap. I looked up those terms. This is one of those narc behaviors that's made worse by underlying BPD.",t3_km79ok
ghfgm35,t1_ghdtpsu,"I understand this. And this was honestly one of the steps I worked on. Not putting qualifiers on praise or congrats. Or trivializing the things they do because you could do it much easier or much quicker or you already knew. It was so hard.

So it's fucking terrific that you're working on that. We'll get there.",t3_km79ok
ghfics1,t1_ghefsv3,"Oh positive reinforcement was non-existant in my house growing up.

My therapist has been trying this from day one. And from day one she has noticed that I react oddly to it. And it's oddly difficult to verbalize why I'm uncomfortable with it. It just feels so ingenuine. From anyone. She probed a little about it one time and I actually got agitated. Not really at her. But agitated. And I said somewhen ""the only person whose opinion about me that I care about is mine."" And that was a bit surprising. Haven't really thought through that yet.

I think there have been more instances of other people being happy for me than me being happy for myself. I have really only ever been surprised and happy to get complimented on writing. That's the only thing.",t3_km79ok
ghfjaga,t1_gheln0i,"Well you see even then I have difficulty. Cause then I don't understand what the accomplishment is. Like I know I shouldn't have to understand. But I do feel closer to appreciating what they've done if I can understand why it's an achievement. But yeah if it's in the same background as I have I feel more begrudging.

I think it's important that I genuinely feel that way for someone else. They deserve it.",t3_km79ok
ghfxq0q,t1_ghef4fg,"http://coachingtowardhappiness.com/pdf/WillYouBeThereForMeWhenThingsGoRight.pdf

Try that. You can google most journal articles followed by pdf and find them.",t3_km79ok
ghd9hom,t1_ghd58le,"Both lack of accomplishments and resentments seem to be closely linked on my journey, too. 

It just came up in therapy and my therapist said we should just leave the resentments on the table for a while. My pain and experiences are valid. It's been helping. I've found it freeing and grounding and I've been able to walk toward some realistic achievements in ways that I've never been able to before. 

I don't think we need to feel badly about it. I think we have to willingly let go of some justified resentments when we are ready.",t3_km79ok
gkgo0op,t1_ghfics1,Can I just say that it's awesome to see you here working this shit out for yourself? My mom has undiagnosed BPD/NPD and is completely unaware of her malignant behaviors. I am happy that there are other people out there with this diagnosis who are as self aware as you.,t3_km79ok
ghflhl7,t1_ghfjaga,"So I think what makes it hard for us is that weâ€™re reaching for feelings who donâ€™t have naturally. Can you put yourself in their head at all? Like for example, I have a friend who has progressed really far in a field we both started in but I dropped out of. I know all the steps she has had to go through, the challenges she has faced and the worry and insecurity sheâ€™s had to overcome to get where she is. And I understand why she wants it - her motivation is basically to succeed, to achieve something that is incredibly difficult for most people who go down that route.

Do you think if you asked questions about their path to achieving whatever it is and understanding what their motivation was in the first place would help you get it more fully? Or do you already do that and it just doesnâ€™t make sense as itâ€™s too far removed from what you are interested in or would pursue?",t3_km79ok
ghgdckz,t1_ghfxq0q,Thanks!,t3_km79ok
gkgwfhz,t1_gkgo0op,"Thanks. I suspect my mother has at least BPD, and likely a few narc traits. How did you get out unscathed? Or have you? lol",t3_km79ok
