It fucking sucks being self-aware, even though it is for the best. I am feeling this as well, the not knowing what to do. You feel so lost.

Don't know how we can get past it, but we can survive this and eventually live a good life.",t3_kkzn3n

Practice reaching back, day by day. Try to really remember a day, and then a week, and then a month. You will experience a lot of emotion that isn’t normal for you. That’s how neurotypicals remember. Emotion encodes memory.",t3_kkzn3n
gh7knbc,t3_kkzn3n,"What you are afraid to do is a clear indication of the next thing you need to do. - Ralph Waldo Emerson

Are you afraid to apologize? Are you afraid to be alone? Are you afraid to go to therapy? Are you afraid of remembering? Are you afraid of seeing the only people you have thought of as the good characters in your story as the more ambiguous characters they are? Are you afraid to trust? Are you afraid to let go of control?

One terrifying step at a time.

As for the memory bit, I have trouble remembering what I've done in a day or what I did over the weekend too. But other things I remember like a movie. Not things you'd always consider significant. But apparently they were because I remember them. Useful content to work through personality disorders",t3_kkzn3n
