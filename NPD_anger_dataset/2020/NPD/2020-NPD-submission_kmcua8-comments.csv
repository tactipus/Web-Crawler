ghel1in,t3_kmcua8,Think about how to recognise your triggers for when you begin “playing” and do your best to stop. It’s not right or fair on the people involved in this. It will be hard to stop at first like quitting smoking or alcohol the urges will be there but you can fight it in search of creating better habits. The problem is it doesn’t sound like you want to stop or change and that itself will be your biggest hurdle.,t3_kmcua8
