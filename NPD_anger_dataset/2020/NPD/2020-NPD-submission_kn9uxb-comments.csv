ghjp2zk,t1_ghjkylr,There is no working out. A person with NPD is running on empty (not having developed a true self). Therefore the person constantly needs validation as a narcissistic supply to feel good about themselves. But the world does not work in a way to provide the supply only. So narcissist gets injured all the time he/she are not getting the supply they are needing. So all their life is a constant struggle to get the next dose of validation.,t3_kn9uxb

ghl4a4i,t1_ghki5gd,"it depends on the person and their life, it could be like hanging out with people who you know will be nice and validating to you, or doing something you know you're good at and showing it to people so that you get praise for it",t3_kn9uxb

ghmwryb,t1_ghmvjon,"Geez, you need to calm down. I don’t know what gender you are, though you would have responded no matter what I did.

ghkev4q,t1_ghkeub0,"/u/HarroldBushman, I have found an error in your comment:

 > “admit ~~your~~ [**you're**] a total”

I suggest that you, HarroldBushman, write “admit ~~your~~ [**you're**] a total” instead. ‘Your’ is possessive; ‘you're’ means ‘you are’.
