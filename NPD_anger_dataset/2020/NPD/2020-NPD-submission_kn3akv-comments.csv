I think you have to flesh out your own achievements and believe in them to feel a sense of peace which is harder when you’ve had less time to do that because you are younger. Just look at the path that you are on, aim to own that and take whatever learning you can from others on the way.

We are all a weird and complex mix and if we’ve spent years feeling like we are top dog (or even kidding ourselves that we are) it can be really painful to encounter people who already have the things that we want and not to blame ourselves for being ‘lesser’. 

As much as a lot of us build ourselves up to manage our low self esteem and act as if we think we’re god, people are so complex and varied that there is no real superiority (even though my own brain is right now telling me well, you’re better than those losers you went to school with etc,etc). However, it’s just not true, we all do the best we can with what we got, and no one gets control over what they were given, so it’s a null point.

And while that’s painful to accept, it comes with the benefit of realising that if no one is superior, no one is inferior, including you.

I say, while to stop my brain rattling off a list of reasons why I am in actual fact better than other people lol.",t3_kn3akv

ghizfvu,t3_kn3akv,"As someone with NPD, I always have the following thoughts: okay she may be hotter than me, but does she have the knowledge/experience/talents/humor etc that I have? 
You know, we are all special in the end, there's no one else out there like you, and that's just a fact. 
I even like to give myself some credit for having a PD (i know it sounds weird) but come on, how many people are REALLY diagnosed with it? 0.5% of population. Yup. We special my friends.",t3_kn3akv
ghkgyhg,t1_ghizfvu,"Haters gonna hate. This is a really good way of dealing with the short term feelings - you're not in therapy 24/7, so do what works when you have to. Save your energy challenging thoughts that are actually causing harm.

I'm not jealous when my partner is alone with other people because I am really different to those other people and my partner fell for me as I was. If I dwell on this too much maybe I will start feeling entitled or have some other downside - but I don't, so there is no downside.",t3_kn3akv
