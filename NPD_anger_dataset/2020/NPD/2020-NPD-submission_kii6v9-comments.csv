ggsc5cv,t3_kii6v9,"I’m so confused about what happened here. The author of the article seems to see Smythe as kind of pathetically stalking Shkreli. It’s hard to say what Shkreli was up to, except that in the end he clearly wanted nothing to do with Smythe. There seemed to be a pattern where Shkreli was using Smythe to gain sympathy and connection from the outside world; but we only know about her actions from the reporter’s point of view. It also seems like the author doesn’t buy Smythe’s view of herself. Smythe appears, from this article, to believe she sacrificed her career in order to fight for justice & reform. The author seems to think she is deluded and gave everything up just to end up writing articles (that few will ever read) from a basement apartment. 

I can’t tell where the power lies in this situation. But she did trash his boundaries after gaining access to him in a moment of real powerlessness for him. She seems pretty dangerous, now that I think about it.",t3_kii6v9
ggr55zp,t1_ggr2rx5,"Do you think this is a normal way to handle a relationship though..? Even if he didn’t like that she made their relationship public, he said he wanted a future with her - shouldn’t he at least try to communicate and work it out with her, if he indeed was truthful about loving her..? That’s what screams narcissist to me - that once she disobeyed him he dropped her like she never existed, despite all of the words he had promised before.",t3_kii6v9
ggsck7k,t1_ggr55zp,"No that is not unreasonable of him in this case. Why is she entitled to him keeping his word if she doesn’t have basic respect for him in a relationship. If someone requests something like that, telling u not to do something that invasive, especially in a relationship, u are an asshole to just disregard it and do it anyway. But what may scream narcissism to me is him raising drug prices criminally high, it can look like a lack of empathy (which is a symptom of npd and aspd). But again u would never know unless you worked with him up close. You cant just tell off an article, but maybe u can see some actions that may align with npd. She also seems she may be npd, bpd, codependent (which is really more of a pop psych term), or have some of these traits. Many times (not always tho) people who are attracted to npd partners, are narcissists themselves or some other cluster b or may just have cluster b traits (its a spectrum), or sometimes low self esteem.",t3_kii6v9
ggraniw,t1_ggr55zp,I would dump her so hard for the breach of privacy. Gross.,t3_kii6v9
ggrh6jk,t1_ggr55zp,No that is a huge breach of trust. Not narcissistic at all.,t3_kii6v9
