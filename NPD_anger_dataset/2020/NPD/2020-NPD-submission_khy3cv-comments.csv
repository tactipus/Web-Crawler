ggodtix,t3_khy3cv,I have a very poor memory of my entire childhood until maybe 16. Could be repressed trauma ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,t3_khy3cv

ggoenln,t3_khy3cv,"usually its because of trauma, yeah.",t3_khy3cv
ggoszg0,t3_khy3cv,"I only remember very specific events, some of which aren't traumatic or anything. Others are, but they don't cause me any physical reaction, at least not consciously. I wonder if it's because I'm just not fully feeling it because they were quite frightening as a child. I forgot about most of what my daily life looked like.",t3_khy3cv
ggsz3j7,t3_khy3cv,thought this was only me. Literally no memories from before I was 10,t3_khy3cv
ggv7yyv,t3_khy3cv,"Actually, I have extremely good memory of my childhood, I can remember details since I was 4. 

It's kind of painful, I was molested & abused for months by my uncle when I was 5 but my mother gaslighted me about the event (I hope she did it as a way to protect me, maybe she thought I would forget and move on if we pretend it didn't happen). Despite all the gaslighting, I still remember in detail how I was groomed and what happened.",t3_khy3cv
