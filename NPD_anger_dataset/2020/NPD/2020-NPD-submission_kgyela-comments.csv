ggi4ef2,t3_kgyela,"I didn't learn how to train myself to empathize, until years of therapy. It was essential for me to change that character flaw about myself, in order to be the best person I can be.. Not just for others, but for myself. That has to be a personal decision you make on your own accord though. will be all the more difficult considering the limited psychiatric options NPs have

I still haven't figured out how to satiate my needs for validation. I never really have to try, though. 

A simple solution? Enjoy the virtual thumbs internet strangers throw your way, in different ways. Make a YouTube channel. SIMPLY ASK an understanding friend for validation, or find a friend that enjoys hyping you up on a public platform. Study the science behind social media... feels empowering to have 10,000 followers on Instagram and only follow a few dozen people back, or have statuses and selfies gain the approval of hundreds of strangers. 

A more challenging, endearing one..?  Fucking do something with your life that actually proves to others how special you are. You think you deserve recognition for how special you are, but, have you actually done anything to deserve that recognition? I know that debilitating mental illness makes it all the more difficult, especially when we were faced with invalidation in our youth. Still, you cannot use that as a reason to not meet your fullest potential. Make your existence something that people feel compelled to acknowledge and admire. Explore your passions. Go to college. Pursue your dreams. CONTRIBUTE SOMETHING TO THE WORLD, even if you just shit-post or provide people advice occasionally on sub reddits.  Seriously, nothing is more rewarding than being admired for something more substantial. 

If you need someone to hype you up, let me know. I'll spam whatever I have to with likes or upvotes to help nudge others to start recognizing your greatness. You're destined for it, I'm sorry that others fail to realize that",t3_kgyela
ggi27t3,t3_kgyela,"When you really think about it, do you want to continue living the way you have been?",t3_kgyela
ggk7w6i,t3_kgyela,Okay. It's kinda funny to see narcs talk to each other when they're at various stages of recovery.,t3_kgyela
ggjiy0k,t3_kgyela,"Are you pretty and better than everyone else? Are you incredible? Do you hold true power? Could your boyfriend not do better than you?

You do have empathy, you're just a dick. You can stop being a dick pretty easily, it's a good first step.",t3_kgyela
ggi4u9c,t1_ggi4ef2,Thank you!! ❤️,t3_kgyela
ggi31eo,t1_ggi27t3,"Sometimes I acknowledge how problematic it can be but at other times I expect people to just handle me. I do feel lonely but loneliness is something I can deal with. I don’t really see a problem with my mindset, I think it’s beneficial to me. But I can get how it might push people away...",t3_kgyela
ggjp1nz,t1_ggjiy0k,"Yes to all those things and nah, I’m not a dick and don’t care for your stupid, corny ass advice. Get off this fucking subreddit imbecile.",t3_kgyela
ggi9qjc,t1_ggi31eo,"Ok. I often prefer being alone. But I don't like feeling lonely, which, for me, means feeling disconnected from others and, fundamentally, from myself.",t3_kgyela
ggjthys,t1_ggjp1nz,"I think you're a troll but ok. In the sentence where people have told you you have no empathy you say ""I honestly just don't care"" - that's confirmation that you're a dick. My advice is that everyone knows what being a dick is, so stopping being a dick isn't so hard. 

Just those questions in turn, you are not better than everyone else or incredible. You seem worse than average based on this post. You don't seem to hold any power, as you describe people calling you out and you think you aren't getting what you deserve in terms of recognition - which if you had power would be the first thing you'd get. 

I think your boyfriend probably could do better than you. He'd have to be much worse than average to not get someone average or above. If he is worse than you, why on earth are you dating him?",t3_kgyela
ggjukk0,t1_ggjthys,"Blah blah blah, why are you so worried about me and what I do/think? You don’t seem to get wtf NPD even is so why are you on this subreddit? Hop off my dick since my existence threatens you so much xoxo",t3_kgyela
ggjv9ph,t1_ggjukk0,Because you're posting on an NPD support sub and I'm offering support. I like to think I understand NPD because I have it and have been studying it for a couple years. I think this is a starting on the wrong foot sort of thing - always here to talk if you need it.,t3_kgyela
ggjvna7,t1_ggjv9ph,"Sounds good, just don’t say I’m worse than average, that’s the opposite of what I wanna hear lol",t3_kgyela
ggjvv38,t1_ggjvna7,Well you can just focus on ways you're above average - probably IQ and looks. Maybe manners and hygiene.,t3_kgyela
