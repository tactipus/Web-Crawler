ggzm6p5,t3_kjtcfv,"I'm not sure but since vulnerable narcissism is correlated with shame and neuroticism I guess negative self talk might be present in VNs especially if very low functioning, if they have a comorbid mood disorder or anxiety disorder like social anxiety, if they're not getting the attention they want or not having their fantasy/desire fullfilled.

If a VN's fantasy is to be well liked by anyone or considered as a noteworthy/smart/attractive individual I guess having their shortcomings exposed or having them visible all the time might result in negative self-talk ( especially if he/she is aware of a flaw but unable to fix it) . If the  VN is not getting what he wants he might put the blame more on other people for being insensitive/ shallow/ idiots/etc but unless completely unaware he knows there are things that could be improved - ""If I lose weight/ I get that job/ I become more charming/ I get X then people will realize they were wrong""  ( revenge or redemption are frequent fantasies for VNs).

We also read all the time in this sub of VNs desiring to be seen as ""great and pleasant people"" but they realized that in the past they appeared arrogant and then decided to hide this trait because they intellectually know that arrogance and condescension are usually ill received by other people. Hiding this trait make their needs or desideres more easily met. So there is some level of self awareness.

I'm describing what I feel about myself but I've never been diagnosed as having npd, I'm diagnosed as having social anxiety, major depressive disorder and ocd",t3_kjtcfv
gh1hf82,t3_kjtcfv,"\>Do you guys experience negative self-talk?

Yes, but it's insidious in that it's a form of negative self-talk that i'm actually comfortable with.

Beating myself up for not getting up with my first alarm? Ok and acceptable, that's being ""fair"" and other people wouldn't judge me harshly for it so it's fairly tame. Just plan a solution around it in a detached manner and move on.

Calling myself out for identifying a problem / item to be addressed, then drifting off scrolling on my phone instead of taking logical steps to resolve it? Over the line - if other people saw me behave this way, they would lose respect for me.

In fact, i'll sum it up by expanding on that last line; i'm perfectly happy to beat myself up over stuff that doesn't matter, but if it's something that's socially unacceptable, I basically have to feed it into my internal narrative by force because it never gets generated within it.

Maybe try it out on yourself and see if there are any topics your internal monologue seems to avoid.",t3_kjtcfv
ggz8982,t3_kjtcfv,"Narcissists hate themselves, but they usually don't have an internal monologue/dialogue about that. They have that all walled off, which is a big part of what the disorder is a defensive organization against.",t3_kjtcfv
gh4hxb4,t3_kjtcfv,"Cluster bitches generally have childhood trauma first and foremost, followed by a mood disorder filling, and a nice topping of Cluster B traits. 

Negative self talk can come from the first two pretty easily, and I've heard BPD can have it too. As a vulnerable narc I haven't had negative talk, but when I'm really depressed I sometimes get ""are you ok? You doing alright? Hey, is everything ok?"" pop into my head - before medication, when I was super depressed I'd get people call my name from the other side of the house too. Weird. I told my psych and he said ""Well sounds like it's not an issue, so it's not.""",t3_kjtcfv
ggysjpe,t3_kjtcfv,Well I guess I’m not a narcissist. Half of my self talk is extremely negative. I hate myself w a passion. You all should give it a try.,t3_kjtcfv
gh2ivvd,t3_kjtcfv,"Yep I have a very critical inner voice, which comes around after inner self loathing is triggered, and then I also become more bpd or emotionally dysregulated.",t3_kjtcfv
gh03fxc,t1_ggzm6p5,"Well thought-out. I'm entertained by the rough conclusion of ""vulnerable narcs might. Maybe. They'd likely have to be low functioning and have another issue.""",t3_kjtcfv
gh3lwqf,t1_gh1hf82,"OMG! This. This is what happens. My internal monologue used to never consider things. When people brought things up about my behavior, I would mentally check out. If they said I said something hurtful, I would mentally check out.

My brain still goes ""well it would be unpleasant to continue down this path of thought, so let's go this way instead."" That scrolling through the phone thing or random internet surfing really resonated with me. It's really only when I'm alone for extended periods of time that I actually think the things that need thought.",t3_kjtcfv
ghd0w4a,t1_ggz8982,"Does this apply to covert/vulnerable narcissists, as well? I hate myself and constantly ruminate on everything that’s wrong with me.",t3_kjtcfv

ggyuiy6,t1_ggysjpe,Well part of the reason I'm asking is to see if narcs have negative self talk. Maybe I'm the weird one here.,t3_kjtcfv
ghdeeft,t1_ghd0w4a,"Well, it kind of depends on whether the rumination is connected to anything, or rather anyone else. If the suffering is turned into a kind of martyr or victim complex type deal then it can act as a protective shield against deeper feeling. i.e., as a shield against really feeling guilt and accepting responsibility for the narcissist's role in their suffering (however much others also play roles in this too, since it always takes two (or more) to tango).

All of that is different than classical NPD, though. Many PDs have narcissistic elements to them (most of them do to a greater or lesser extent), NPD is kind of unique in that it tends to be particularly centred on conflicts around enviousness (either feeling it toward others or projecting it out and believing that others are envious of them), and a tendency to act superior and to try to control and dominate others who are seen as less-than.

The covert narcissist who still has NPD is one who idealizes the other narcissistically rather than the self, and basks in the reflected glory of that idealized other, obtaining admiration and the needed feeling of being envied by connection with that enviable other (this is the closet narcissist described by Masterson, also called the idealizing narcissist described by the self-psychologists). The thing about covert/vulnerable narcissism is that it's kind of a slippery concept and it can apply to depressive and borderline personality disorders as well as some others, but then this is not what's meant by closet or idealizing NPD. The closet or idealizing narcissist is still highly focused on grandiosity, but tends to be much more self-deprecating and self-effacing. It's kind of the inverse side of the overtly grandiose and exhibitionist narcissist who devalues the other and idealizes themselves. But both are focussed on grandiosity in different ways.",t3_kjtcfv
ghfu4yg,t1_ghdeeft,"Ok, I don’t relate to any of that too much, only slightly. My rumination switches to feeling guilt for what I did wrong to then also being angry and stuck on what the other person did to me. I just always take things too far and I just can never seem to contain myself in emotional situations. I don’t try to act superior to people or try control them because I think they’re less than me but because I just want them to make the right decisions. I don’t relate to wanting to be idealized by my connections, but I do idealize people and have a self-effacing attitude. I just can’t ignore my imperfections and can’t stand people who act better than they are and don’t want to be one of those people who’s more overly confident than they should be.",t3_kjtcfv
ghhf81h,t1_ghfu4yg,"Well, superiority can still manifest in a feeling of being more correct than others, or more ethical/moral/proper. It isn't necessarily about putting on an air of superiority. On the other hand, if it is about wanting them to make good decisions, this could have a controlling aspect to it, it kind of depends on whether you're ultimately able to let them make their own decisions without attacking or devaluing them, or acting passive-aggressively (dropping the subject, refusing to talk to them when they go a different way, stuff like that). The passive-aggressive response could be sensible, though, at least if you're talking about circumstances where the right thing to do isn't particularly ambiguous and the person you're judging as doing wrong is talking about doing something that is clearly bad/wrong, e.g., criminal action that will definitely hurt other people, and you want to oppose that.

Control in NPD is typically about preserving the admired self-image that the person needs to project and needs others to believe in so that they will continue admiring the NPD'd person. It can also be about preserving the idealized qualities in the other in the case of the closet narcissist, either way, control is about preserving admiration against the fear of being found out to be a phony, bad, deficient person in reality (which is itself unrealistic, this is the other side of splitting of the self). In BPD it's more about preventing perceived abandonment or receiving attention and care from the other in exchange for compliant, pleasing behaviour. In schizoid PD (and avoidant PD) the need for control is more about preserving the self from what feels like engulfment, consumption, or the fear that one will consume or drain out the other with one's neediness - in either case, the defense is mainly to withdraw from the other and remain unrelated. Note that sadomasochism is a feature of all of these different disorders' object relations, but the way this manifests differs a lot (though there exists a lot of overlap amongst these different conditions). Also, about the different ways that each can manifest, these shift depending on whether self or other is idealized, and whether the bad, devalued image is felt about the self or projected outwardly into the other. Either way, there is a split between self and other - and in these disorders, especially in BPD, who is devalued and who is idealized tends to switch back and forth readily in a kind of role reversal. This can also happen in NPD and schizoid PD but it tends to be less obvious and there often isn't as much affect about it. The specific configurations of internalized object relations, the specific dyads (and certainly there tends to be more than one of these), are the result of introjective and identificatory processes that are a normal part of developmental processes involved in personality development. The combination of the real parenting and the child's perceptions of it are what get introjected and identified with, and these form the internalized object relations that a person has. Long term psychotherapy, an especially good and healing relationship can change these for the better in people who struggle with extreme conflicts in them like the ones I've described. Also if any of this sounds like attachment theory it should, because these are very, very similar ideas (Bowlby was very influenced by Ronald Fairbairn).

As to the oscillations between guilt and focussing on recrimination of others, this is a really common conflict in narcissistic difficulties (again, this is a lot broader than just NPD). (It also is an example of that kind of switching back and forth between different self and other images that I mentioned previously.) In order to do something to repair damage to others that we've done in our narcissism, we have to get beyond being attacked by ourselves harshly and in an extreme way (this is part of the split view of the self that is part of narcissistic disorders, which the grandiose, exhibitionistic narcissist (to use Masterson's language again; for self-psychologists this is the mirror narcissist) walls off and compensates against). That kind of extreme self-hate and self-reproach makes it pretty appealing to try to displace that onto others at any opportunity available, so as to not have to feel it toward yourself. When we feel that persecuted, it's hard to remember that other people exist as people, not things, because we're so hung up on protecting ourselves from catastrophe (for narcissistic patients, this involves fear of vulnerability that they have warded off with their grandiose self. For schizoid patients a common fear is needing to depend on others which they protect against with a fantasy of self-sufficiency. And for borderline patients, the fear is often of losing their object, being abandoned).

And when we feel persecuted to that extent, we want to find others to persecute so that we can displace that self-reproach. Finding a way to have some compassion for both self and others, and to see both self and others as mixtures of good and bad, not either all-good or all-bad, this is a significant part of mental health (this is often termed whole object relatedness, or the achievement of ambivalence, in the psychoanalytic and psychodynamic literature). One of the ways that we can come to bear guilt is to see both self and other as whole, mixtures of good and bad qualities. This also prevents acting out defensively, if we can remember that the other is good even when we're feeling that they're bad, if say, we're feeling threatened by them in some way, we're less likely to act out in extreme ways that it becomes often very difficult to apologize for and repair. And at the same time, bearing guilt while having compassion for oneself for ways one has acted out while in that narcissistic defensive mode, makes it easier to really bear the guilt in a way that doesn't turn into a self-indulgent and masochistic exercise. Learning how to admit fault without hating oneself, and to offer genuine apology and to make a real, honest and thorough effort to apologize for and repair one's past transgressions, this is a really key step in recovery from narcissistic disorders.

(There's a reason why this is part of AA, which is full of people struggling with the various disorders I've mentioned in this post (again, all of which have elements of narcissistic difficulties in them).)

(It should be noted that splitting is adaptive in some very unusual circumstances like if someone is robbing you or trying to kill you or something. So splitting isn't all-bad, but its use should be subject to rational control.)

Betty Joseph's book, Psychic Equilibrium and Psychic Change, and John Steiner's concept of the psychic retreat (about which he has written two books) are particularly instructive here, as is Kleinian theory in general.",t3_kjtcfv
