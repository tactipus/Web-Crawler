But you don't have it easy by any stretch. Sometimes I think Dr Grande, while a good source of information, doesn't do his due diligence to call out his commenters spreading shit. I see it's complicated by their possible mental health issues, but if a famous YouTuber had racist or sexist comments flooding their comment section we would expect them to say SOMETHING.",t3_khg199
ggkwuvh,t3_khg199,"It’s ignorance and Internet pop psychology it’s the same thing that has stigmatized mental health forever.    Individual people should be accountable for their toxic behavior, lumping everyone into the same box is disordered thinking in itself.  Most of these people are narcissistic and or disordered themselves",t3_khg199
gglaxol,t3_khg199,"We can safely assume that the majority of people searching for the term ""narcissist"" online fall in one of two categories.

1. They are in an unhappy situation involving a narcissist and seeking resources.
2. They have been hurt, and are seeking to explain/validate their anger/pain.

That being said, the latter of the two groups is far more likely to comment anywhere online that allows them to complain, so anywhere you see narcissists mentioned which allows for public comment will invariably flood with horror stories.

Sadly, there is no incentive for anyone to stand up for narcissists with an opinion in the contrary because they would be effectively arguing with someone who is merely expressing a painful memory for the purpose of validation and/or catharsis. It is also widely viewed that narcissists don't need anyone to protect their self-esteem or reputation because they are assumed to be immutably in love with themselves based on pervasive and crude stereotyping.

Although I don't think that there is a complete consensus on how those affected with any narcissistic disorder should be viewed, there is indeed a worrying number of people who don't believe that narcissists should be afforded any time or opportunity due to being unfairly deemed an *imminent threat to others*.

Worst of all, the vast majority of online content relating to NPD and all of its types reinforces stereotypes as they are *warning* people about ""*them""* (othering, grouping) which, from the perspective of a person with NPD, is dehumanising propaganda that makes Hitler's Mein Kampf seem like book of poetry in praise of Jews. Just look at this insane level of demonisation found in a trashy relationship-based content mill, written in an authoritative fashion by someone who is neither a clinician or a journalist and may have never met a narcissist before: [https://www.lovepanky.com/my-life/relationships/signs-of-covert-narcissism](https://www.lovepanky.com/my-life/relationships/signs-of-covert-narcissism)

I hate to support trash like that with clicks but it's almost comically vindictive. There are hundreds of similar trash articles written by unqualified nobodies online saying basically the same things without meaningful evidence or purpose other than to be clickbait for either of the two groups mentioned at the start of this comment.

All of that being said, you should remain optimistic that if you are self aware and if you are capable of having healthy relationships then you will overcome negative stereotypes. Maybe not always with people who have been significantly hurt by a narcissist in the past, because then it's a matter of forgiveness/bravery instead of presumption, but certainly with those who have not been harmed. While NPD is a challenging disorder that doesn't receive much sympathy or support from the neurotypical community, it should be recognised that there are many personality and neurological disorders which are profoundly painful to experience (or fatal) and therefore you should not be discouraged from living your best life despite disadvantages and difficulty. 

And putting the neurotypical community aside, the personality disorder community as a whole tends to have a lot of patience and sympathy for one another because we know it's not a choice and we recognise the challenges in our own lives that are not easily perceived or understood by others.",t3_khg199
gglgijc,t3_khg199,"Public perception of mental disorders are usually very far off from what experiencing them actually feels like. It's still mind boggling to me how, even those close to me, characterize people with disorders in such a negative light. People are more than their diagnoses. A diagnoses should not define you. Instead it should be a tool to navigate your own behaviors and it's important to help you forgive yourself for past issues. Hopefully, your diagnoses gave you some explanation of why you behaved the way you did in the past so you won't judge yourself. Controlling how others judge you is a whole different battle. It sounds like you are doing the work and I know that's really hard! I myself have been in therapy and I know all the mental work it takes.

Side note, Dr. Grande once replied to my comment on youtube and I was fangirling so hard.
