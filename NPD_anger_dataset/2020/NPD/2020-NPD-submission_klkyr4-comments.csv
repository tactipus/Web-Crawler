ghb1l7d,t3_klkyr4,Yeah I've been bullied and abused at various points even though I'm a narcissist. It offers no protection from abuses and in fact I think makes me more of a target.,t3_klkyr4
ghb2m4z,t1_ghb1l7d,I feel so sorry for you. It's okay! I wish there wasn't so many stereotypes about narcissism because if there weren't so many stereotypes about it abuse would lessen.,t3_klkyr4

ghbj2gn,t1_ghb9u12,It seems a lot of people don't know how to deal with narcissistic behavior or NPD so they use fight or flight responses against it which can sometimes be very harmful if not done in the correct circumstances.,t3_klkyr4
ghcpra4,t1_ghb9u12,"This is a fascinating point, about good boundaries requiring vulnerability. One I hadn't even really considered before. Thank you for this.",t3_klkyr4
