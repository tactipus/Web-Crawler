ghhbcan,t3_kmvkf7,"Sam Vaknin has a couple really, really good videos about the bpd and npd couple.",t3_kmvkf7
ghh27g1,t3_kmvkf7,"I highly recommend [Joan Lachkar's book The Narcissistic / Borderline Couple](https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KuCSAgAAQBAJ)

I am someone with BPD dating a person with NPD and this book opened my eyes 100% to the cycle we were in. Feel free to message me ðŸ’•",t3_kmvkf7
ght3p9k,t3_kmvkf7,"Don Carveth's YouTube channel is great. Geared toward therapists but if you're up to doing the work necessary to think about how to apply it to your own life it's very helpful. Unlike Vaknin he actually has a PhD in a field related to psychology and has trained and practices as an analyst and has published two well received books and several journal articles in reputable journals. Also his take isn't stigmatizing and doesn't make narcissists out to be evil sociopaths through and through. Listen to him and you can learn--more valuable than what to think about these issues--how to think about them (he models a moderate and non-split way of seeing things very well, which we all on this sub need to a greater or lesser extent).",t3_kmvkf7
ghiu3xo,t3_kmvkf7,If you listen to Sam Vaknin you'll realize that its hopeless with a narcissist.  Period.,t3_kmvkf7
ghh03he,t3_kmvkf7,"Iâ€™m not unbiased technically but I take an objective view on these things as much as possible, you can message me",t3_kmvkf7
ghj7knl,t1_ghhbcan,"Thanks. From what I've seen, his outlook is too self-defeating for my liking, but I'll check it out.",t3_kmvkf7
ghj7hy6,t1_ghh27g1,"Sounds good, thank you!",t3_kmvkf7
ghj7lx6,t1_ghiu3xo,Get the fuck out of here with your absolutist thinking. This is a support sub.,t3_kmvkf7
ghlaz7y,t1_ghiu3xo,Lol I had NPD. It's true that my narcissism wasn't minted under horrific abuse. But the word of one narcissist that found a pragmatic equilibrium between his PD and treating other people well is not the final word on recovery. He was content where he was. Everyone will get where they want to be if they want to get there. Even full remision.,t3_kmvkf7
ghh0t9v,t1_ghh03he,"Thank you for your kind offer, but I'm looking more along the lines of theories and studies, not personal advice. I already talk through these things with a therapist. Will clarify my post now.",t3_kmvkf7
