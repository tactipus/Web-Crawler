ggijhjg,t3_kh1j6y,"When it comes to intimacy, I want to develop the capability to connect to all people, even while realizing that only a few people may truly ""get"" me and even they won't always do that. I want to appreciate the value of each interaction and relationship just as it is.",t3_kh1j6y
ggj0677,t3_kh1j6y,"On the other hand, the chance of you meeting anyone with a personality disorder IRL is very low. I don't doubt that a lot of cluster bitches hold out for other cluster bitches - but once you're self aware that should be the first thing to go (the holding out, not the friends). 

Something I noticed after a year or so of working on my insight is that average people have really low insight. It definitely lends itself to grandiosity. It's slightly harder for me to be friends with people and I can't tell how much of that is my narcissism speaking and how much is genuine reasons to not like them. Insight is like insulin - some people need it and APPARENTLY MOST PEOPLE DON'T??! anyway. 

For example, I will tell my friends I eat too much and exercise too little, when I used to tell my friends I am fat. When I hear others say they are fat, then when the topic comes to food or exercise they don't seem to notice the connection, it is off putting.",t3_kh1j6y

ggkgvhg,t3_kh1j6y,"... Why don’t you take a moment to feel a little bit prouder of yourself, instead of being one of the narcissist that feel the need to avoid interacting with self-aware people, so they have the capacity to have Some sort of psychological dominance over them... Some npds have an inherent need to possibly manipulate people, or, feel inadequate whenever others surrounding that may match your intellect

Genuinely hope that those unmatched In your self-awareness breed progressive sentiments, Because understanding toxicity and making arrangements to continue it really makes the rest of us look like pieces of shit.  The latter is less severe, yet, I still hope they find it within themselves to finally learn how to be happy in the successes or accomplishments of others.... That intimidations a result of either jealousy, or inner feelings of inadequacy

Congratulations on your incredible progress. We did not come this far, To only come this far, however. Be easier on yourself, at least you’re not struggling with these types of toxicity seen in this community. I know that we are all Destined for greatness and cannot settle with ourselves when we are any less than that so. Chin up",t3_kh1j6y
ggkglyk,t3_kh1j6y,"This is literally so far from foreign of a concept to me, I’m sitting here incapable of actually wanting to interact with anyone that does not match me on my mental level. Whoops, there’s my narcissism, feeling as if I am special and intelligent and can only be understood by other intelligent, special people

I honestly do not believe that the dissatisfaction with interacting with other people that do not mentally stimulate you with some thing that is shakable, concerning this condition. I mean, I have been able to efficiently train myself to empathize, Through years of therapy.... whichI did not believe at first was capable for a narcissist... However... The more self-aware I become,The more intelligence I Acquire in regards to the way not just myself, but how others work... It’s disappointing that this intellect is one unmatched by many Neurtypical’s, And I have no idea whether it’s unhealthy to anyone but my own self to be dissatisfied with unintelligent, Unstimulating  interpersonal interactions in life. Literally,  just has compelled me to isolate myself and Indulge in the random inappropriate self disclosure with an Internet stranger that bring a minute of enlightenment.",t3_kh1j6y
ggj0ls5,t1_ggijhjg,"I've found my idea of friendship was pretty one dimensional. I now try to have different kinds of friends, which is closer to valuing people individually. I have business owner friends, delivery worker friends, salt of the earth types, dog walking friends etc - I try to stick to talking to them about those topics. I won't get a best friend out of it, but it's helped me from only valuing friends who were best friend material.",t3_kh1j6y
ggipjga,t1_ggijhjg,"This is also what I’ve been trying to do, but I’ve found it heavily fatiguing and its also been hard to manage resentments at having to attend social engagements when my resources are low (which atm is quite reliably everyday. Fuck burnout).

I do love superficial interactions though, where there is no obligation involved. Give me a morning of those and I’m a happy camper but expect me to give you any level of emotional labour for a few hours and I’m totally wiped for the rest of the day, and then my kids miss out on engagement with me. I’m hoping some time off is going to help with this. Talk to me in a month and hopefully I’m a whole new person ;)",t3_kh1j6y
ggn9xcb,t1_ggijhjg,"You and they determine the value of each interaction and relationship. There is no inherent value. Your desire to develop the capability to connect to all people (perfectionism) is probably as much of a symptom of grandiosity as being particular about the relationships to which you assign value on the basis of how well they understand you and themselves (elitism). I don't think this should worry you, but you should go easy on yourself and try to appreciate/propagate everyday positive interactions with others instead of analysing the meaningfulness of the relationship. This kind of meta-cognition which relies on subjectivity despite involving people other than yourself may become an issue if you are constantly having to make assumptions about what is going in inside another person's head in order to qualify the quality of your connection.

Most people only have a handful of truly meaningful relationships, especially if we exclude family members (with whom a deep connection is often inherent, even if not always positive). With everyone else (who is non-threatening), we should just try to be pleasant and/or productive.",t3_kh1j6y
ggji65n,t1_ggj0677,"Can relate. There seems to be a trend these days, where low self-esteem and self-deprecation get flaunted around as 'insight/self-awareness'. People say things like: 'I'm no good I fail at everything,' and then everyone else is like, oh wow this person is so honest and self-reflective! But they're not lol. It's still a blanket generalisation, not based on evidence or facts of how the person *actually* is. It's like the opposite side of the grandiosity coin of thinking you're perfect and superior.

I feel like many people with social anxiety, depression and whatnot actually have this but they don't realise it. It slips under the radar because most people only see the dangers of the more overt narc traits. If you're down on yourself/self-victimise a lot, people tend to comfort you and empathise with you, and that actually positively reinforces the behaviour. Which makes it harder to snap out of it.",t3_kh1j6y
ggj0cyi,t1_ggitxhh,It is too. Can you think of any others? We could get a list going then make a post asking for more.,t3_kh1j6y
ggkxk8q,t1_ggkgvhg,"Thanks. I'm not beating myself up. It takes effort to self monitor but the flip side -- not doing it -- leads me to unhappiness. For me, self monitoring is liberating, not a burden. This is because I'm consciously driving my life from the inside out rather being blindly driven by it.",t3_kh1j6y
ggkhk46,t1_ggkglyk,">I honestly do not believe that the dissatisfaction with interacting with other people that do not mentally stimulate you with some thing that is shakable, concerning this condition.

I mean, how certain are you? Do you have enough data to back that claim up, or is it more a strong feeling kind of a deal?

I absolutely feel this from time to time, but i've only been trying this new way of doing things for under a month and I've seen real progress.

... I also kind of worked myself up responding to posts instead of doing what I really ought to have been, so got a way to go yet hahaha

There are a lot of ways to be a stimulation junkie I guess - maybe it's something we have to tackle more generally before it will work for people as well.",t3_kh1j6y
ggitv49,t1_ggipjga,"Going to lead with the qualifier here of 'this has been my experience and yours might vary', but by trying to live more authentically / less grandiosely, I've found it takes less and less energy to be social.

Be fair and go easy on yourself though, it will take time! You will make it and you will see and enjoy your progress as you go though!",t3_kh1j6y
ggit57l,t1_ggipjga,"For me, it's more about quality than the length of the interaction. Also, I love that you value engaging with your kids.",t3_kh1j6y

gha5b6s,t1_ggn9xcb,Well said,t3_kh1j6y
ggjiqfy,t1_ggji65n,"Yes that is so right, and it is the opposite of insight. 

I guess it adds to this idea that what's missing is mere self reflection - nah narcissists are some of the most self reflective people possible. The problem is it's all circus mirrors. Insight, the accurate view of oneself, that's the money maker. 

If someone goes to therapy they are being self reflective, but they won't get better until they can stomach some criticisms from their therapist and eventually act on those criticisms themselves.",t3_kh1j6y
ggj2o1o,t1_ggj0cyi,"Uh, off the top of my head and in no particular order:

- Holy shit my whole personality is a trauma response

- Holy shit most of the people in my life have these traits and I'm not sure if I'm just projecting or that's where I got it from / that's why they stuck around, time for an existential crisis

- I'm not sure I'm even capable of being empathetic for unselfish reasons because I can't think of how that would work right now and therefore it might be impossible, time for an existential crisis

- I'm going to go wildly overboard on trying to fix this problem quickly because my maladaptions have taught me big emotional hits require massive responses

- Oh wow it's really how I think about, plan and execute everything isn't it? Time for an existential crisis

- What is this strange and reasonable pride you feel when you do the rationally right thing and appreciate it the next day? It's kinda cool!

- Can I put life on pause for a bit? Ah crap, but I need to try out this new way of doing things on my old life to figure things out though. And my responsibilities haven't gone anywhere. Oh wow life just happens all at once doesn't it? Gotta steal moments of serenity and not expect days of cool down huh?

- Oh wow life can still suck even if you're behaving rationally / healthily, and it's bad to overreact to that too

- Oh wow you can't go too far in the other direction either because acting like a psychopath isn't realistic or sustainable

- Oh wow I have to self-monitor constantly because I drift away at a moment's notice, I wonder how much easier it gets?

- Oh wow it gets much easier once you start actually practicing it, that makes perfect sense in hindsight",t3_kh1j6y

Not sure I get what you mean exactly. Do you mean realising that 'the self is an illusion' or something like that? Generally I think mental illnesses (including PDs) are adaptational, they're supposed to make us *more* emotionally intelligent, *more* insightful and functional than average, provided we are able to come out the other side. But that's a high hurdle to clear, and many/most people get stuck and never fully recover. I'm not sure if this is just some grandiose speculation on my part though.",t3_kh1j6y

I know that feel. It's rough being known as 'Mr Wikipedia' and having to accept you know next to nothing about yourself and the only way to learn is the slow way.",t3_kh1j6y
ggkvgvy,t1_ggkfftd,"Self reflection means thinking about yourself and your actions. Insight means having an accurate view of yourself. You can have self reflection without insight - I would say that narcissists have too much self reflection if anything. 

I agree somewhat with your view when it comes to recovered narcissists. There's no data yet so I can't be sure, but plenty of testimonials that greater than average levels of control are possible in recovered narcissists.",t3_kh1j6y

ggnsawl,t1_ggkvgvy,"Ah yes that makes sense. To me the narcissist's self-reflection is about how they are viewed by others. Whereas introspection/insight is how one would behave even when nobody is looking, or when they don't get any recognition for it. I guess the distinction between the two is not very clear cut, especially for people e.g. with PDs who don't have good boundaries / concepts of self vs. other, opinion vs. fact, and so on.",t3_kh1j6y
