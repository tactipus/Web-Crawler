ggp8ruj,t3_ki79v3,"Yes I do relate to that. I feel empathy for animals and people I can relate to, which is good sign, I guess? At least there's hope for us with the help of a professional to build emotional regulation.",t3_ki79v3
ggq39o0,t3_ki79v3,"Definitely. Selective empathy is how I developed a moral compass at all, without it I'd likely be even less caring than I currently am.",t3_ki79v3
ggstv3m,t3_ki79v3,"Instead of switching on/off, my empathy is selective and applies differently with different groups. 

My empathy level is lowest when applied to people and highest for animals & insects. This is due to my envious nature which makes me constantly do upward comparisons to others (people I consider above me = everyone else). As for animals, I've always think of them as innocent being, needed to be protected.",t3_ki79v3
ggpxke2,t3_ki79v3,Yep.  Except it’s different for me.  I despise children so I have a difficult time mustering any sort of empathy for them.  I do have empathy for some adults though since I can relate to them.  I’m also selective about my empathy.  I don’t give a shit about most animals but I have a soft spot for cats and that’s where all my empathy flows.,t3_ki79v3
ggqj65i,t3_ki79v3,"100% normal experience for a narcissist. While the first part could be normal for average people too, the second part - where it appears you have a switch/dial - that's more narcissism. 

There are people who think a recovered narcissist (working on yourself for a couple years) can gain control over that dial.",t3_ki79v3
