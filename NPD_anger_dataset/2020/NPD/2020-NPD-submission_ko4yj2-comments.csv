gholkf1,t3_ko4yj2,Sounds like you are the Scapegoat....  I understand what you are/have been through. I didn’t know the term and couldn’t put my finger on it for very many years...   when I figured it out I HAD NO CHOICE but to draw the necessary boundaries with my family members because it’s abuse and I will not tolerate that anymore in my life blood or not...  my life has immensely improved not only physically but mentally as well.  95% of my anxiety and panic attacks are GONE.   I encourage you to read about being the family scapegoat and if you have any questions please contact me. I’ve been there...  <3,t3_ko4yj2
ghoxns6,t3_ko4yj2,"Sounds good to keep a good distance - she seems to cross your boundaries with a sickening sense of entitlement. A lot of NPD people have issues with their parents - it is a bit ironic as maybe it is a pot calling the kettle black thing. Oh well, valid criticism is valid criticism. 

Lucky to pick up traits early I say. Untreated narcissism sure is ugly.",t3_ko4yj2
ghoq37c,t1_gholkf1,"Do you identify as a Narc as well? Yes, I realise, my brother was the golden child. And being jealous of the attention, I did bully him for a while. I feel my narc traits prevent me from experiencing my fragile self. I have experienced my fragile self-depressed, weak and feeling insignificant. It was a horrible place to be in. I really think this is really the only way I can function.

Edit: For example, if people leave me out of social gatherings, instead of getting all sad and feeling bad for myself, I would start to think that they are not worth my time anyway, or I would go to another party and have more fun than them and really show it. I might end up thinking that they are less of a human being than me etc.

I have compared myself and felt better than the others, not based on sympathy, because of such worthlessness and low self esteem that I need to prop myself up. 

I think my constant need for validation, wanting to become prettier, smarter, more popular and seeking supply has chased people away.

I feel like I have lost a lot-my sanity, my ability to work, and my potential, as well as my hopes and dreams. Meanwhile, I see one of my bullies in school getting married and having a blissful life, holding on a full-time job. The so-called classmates/schoolmates who were poorer/less fortunate than me in some ways-some of them went overseas to study(which costs a lot of money), travelled around the whole world, had a way better life. I know social media is the highlights reel. But if you looked at it objectively: friends, career, love life etc, I really ended up having the shorter end of the stick.",t3_ko4yj2
ghorr3o,t1_ghoq37c,"I have a few traits yeah.... Change and stress throw me overboard typically, I was WAY insecure most of my life still feel shame and I’m  definitely vulnerable (continue to date losers who abuse me) but when I get in those situations I will battle bc I do think I’m really intelligent which is also a trait. 
Your momma is my sister who I guess got this from my father who  did the same shit to me all my life. My brother is a follower and has no backbone.  My mom didn’t treat me poorly and stuck up when she could but it was such a dysfunctional family and  she was abused mentally by my father as well.   it is easy for me to cut ties with anyone and everyone without giving any fucks. my parents are gone and I cut ties with my siblings and I honestly am happy because they cause me great pain and make me feel like a POS and I’m not. It’s difficult for me to bond and trust anyone and i am a loner who has dogs.  I can truly only trust animals.  Your story sounded awfully familiar to me.  You mentioned it was your fault for the abusive  behavior and actions because you have maladaptive behaviors but it’s not....   you developed those behaviors and defense mechanisms most likely because of the treatment you have endured in my opinion.  Although victims/survivors of abuse  think that way which is completely understandable because that’s what they have been told their whole life it’s never their fault. You cannot control other people’s thoughts and behaviors only they can and no one deserves to be treated poorly. I don’t blame any of them because that’s how dad grew up but their shit isn’t my problem.  It’s theirs. <3",t3_ko4yj2
ghos81p,t1_ghoq37c,"I was the same way for lots of years!!!! Have you ever heard the saying “comparing yourself in any way is the thief of joy”?  It’s true.  No one has a perfect anything and can’t see what goes on behind closed doors. FB, the media, and shit loads of people are fake af.  I unfortunately had to go through a very traumatic experience to be able to get passed all that you mentioned amongst other things. I would not wish that on anyone but for me... I wouldn’t take it back because I’ve grown an been able to release lots of bad stuff.  You are not alone my friend!!!",t3_ko4yj2
