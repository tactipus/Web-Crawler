ggoyzta,t3_ki4c8f,I dont wanna burst ur bubble but it takes a certain kind of therapist to help with npd and sadly most therapists arent trained to deal with npd or bpd patients. It can actually even retraumatize some ppl,t3_ki4c8f
ggoubk5,t3_ki4c8f,I have to say that this similar kind of beginning empathy for NPD is what led me here to eventually realize that I had in fact had it. A borderline breaking through the black-and-white thinking against narcissism is not frequent.,t3_ki4c8f
ggqcuk9,t3_ki4c8f,"You are very appreciated, thank you",t3_ki4c8f
gjsq0y6,t3_ki4c8f,"I know this post is a while ago, but I wanted to thank you for saying this. 
I’m trying not to be narcissistic since I found out that I am several years ago. I was really lucky to have a wonderful therapist and I think I’m healing little by little, but sometimes I feel like I’m completely alone in this fight and the whole world is against me because of the stigma. And ironically, that stigma made me more defensive and narcissistic because I felt completely unlovable. 
Now I’m focusing on my childhood traumas and become able to feel kindness towards other people(in a childish way but still a progress for me), but I still constantly feel like I will never be lovable. 

So thank you for making me feel hopeful and loved. :)",t3_ki4c8f
ggqloox,t1_ggoyzta,yes i know. its very unfortunate there isnt more available positive support for individuals struggling with these illnesses. but i wanna let you know just that there is support out there and people who hear you and see beyond the stigma. ik youre in pain and suffering and even the destructive symptoms are just symptoms of someone who is hurting.,t3_ki4c8f
ggoywrj,t1_ggoubk5,U think so? Idk why I find that isnt always true,t3_ki4c8f
ggt4ukv,t1_ggoubk5,"I agree. As a BPD I was dead set on hating (painting black) my ex for life. But reading more and more, I realized the extent of the damage my mother inflicted, and I definitely inherited/adopted many many narcissistic traits. Having compassion is a new eye-opening experience for me and only by reading this sub did I reach the point of understanding past my hurt and anger.",t3_ki4c8f
ggqmh3i,t1_ggqcuk9,thank you <3 wishing u the best of luck,t3_ki4c8f
ggqv8hn,t1_ggqloox,Lol no i do see a therapist im talking about bpd and npd in general. U lucked out bc most therapists suck with bpd npd patients they arent trained to help with their specific issues n needs,t3_ki4c8f
ggqxjvi,t1_ggqv8hn,yeah:: im actually not in therapy bc my most recent therapist decided i was ready for emdr trauma therapy and i was not and it resulted in me reliving trauma i never processed. currently on the hunt for someone and tryna be hopeful but its hard out here lol,t3_ki4c8f
ggt581g,t1_ggqxjvi,Oh my. This happened to me and I wasn't ready either. It was pretty not great all around. Hugs.,t3_ki4c8f
ghabhxl,t1_ggqxjvi,"I can relate-when I was processing past trauma with a counsellor, i went to my first pdoc and I had to share my entire life history with him only to be invalidated. After that, I developed sleep paralysis and my pre-morbid psychotic state kept getting worse. U took the words out of my mouth-you put it aptly.",t3_ki4c8f
ggs5unj,t1_ggqxjvi,Yea but emdr is about processing trauma that u didnt process. It is kinda supposed to be painful and hard but it shouls be worth it. If not I get why u wanna change to something else,t3_ki4c8f
gh0w279,t1_ggt581g,im so sorry:( i hope ur doing better!!,t3_ki4c8f
gh0w1mp,t1_ggs5unj,yeah not quite worth it it put me in danger so but maybe ill try again one day,t3_ki4c8f
ghayvbl,t1_gh0w279,I hope you are as well!,t3_ki4c8f
