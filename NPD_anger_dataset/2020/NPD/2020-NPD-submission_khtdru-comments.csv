ggn8jty,t3_khtdru,"At the risk of being overly-critical over what is apparently a very kind offer and derail the topic (I'll delete post if desired), I find it interesting that you appear to pre-emptively justify emotional needs/desires with cognitive analysis and an overtly transactional manner. I say this because your post offers a rather large amount of explanation for what is essentially an offer to be or behave as relatively ordinary friends/allies on the internet while referring to it as somehow inherently artificial.

You could validate my need to feel qualified to observe the world around me by letting me know if you can identify any particular reason (mood, event, general proclivity) that explains why you've essentially opened a charity for commitment-free social confirmation. I can accept that there is clearly a goodwill element to it, but something about this post comes across as an an unstated expression. That is, unless this is merely a continuation of ""*Being validated by large numbers of people on social media platforms DOES provide some validation, at least enough to hype me up for the rest of that day.*""

*""Self-love is easier to come by when you can see others throwing their 'superficialist' love your way""* \- are you certain? This would appear to be more likely to create dependency issues and over the long haul cause feelings of isolation or resentment if you explicitly identify that their love is superficial, therefore not based on what you believe is meaningful about yourself or your actions.",t3_khtdru
ggn503f,t3_khtdru,Yes please! I‚Äôm stuck writing a proposal for a good freelance gig starting ASAP. I really need / want it but i‚Äôm struggling and need validation i‚Äôm not getting it because i‚Äôm at home with no hype man anywhere to be found,t3_khtdru
ggniora,t1_ggn9x8l,"I don't need one! 

Helps validate myself, in a way, if I have the power to make smallest change in someone's mood/disposition/day",t3_khtdru
ggn2jo9,t1_ggn11zy,"*Amazing, that I have convinced you I am not also bitter, though*",t3_khtdru
ggn2i3a,t1_ggn11zy,Go for it. ‚ù§Ô∏è,t3_khtdru
ggnepca,t1_ggn8jty,"I second this sentiment, this only furthers the addiction to applause that is an integral, defining problem of NPD.

The way to heal is by finding ways to not be so dependent on an approving crowd, and to be maturely dependent (not going the opposite way and denying all need either, since it is healthy to have relational needs which include some validation some of the time, from significant others or close friends, family in one's life).",t3_khtdru
ggni598,t1_ggn8jty,"and, I quote, *""some of the more melancholious narcissists will feel as if even this form of validation is below them.""*

I do not have the energy, nor desire, to attempt to make fundamental changes in a random redditor's life with that disposition. I offer a crumb of serotonin, you read that and still expected more (or, looked down on me for not offering to provide more)

I've been met with apathy and even bitterness, when I first got here, & tried to dip my toes in the waters of similar notions. 

Thanks for your input! I'm sorry you're feeling dysporic. I am, too. 

Let me validate people & pretend like it actually helps people lol. It's an escape from the stresses of my own day, & makes someone feel hot?valid/noticed/motivated online. win for most of us",t3_khtdru
ggn7pro,t1_ggn503f,"I'm about to slide inside those directs right now <3

  
\*Sorry for the delay. I just got done liking everything enchalada lady has every posted on her instagram lol\*",t3_khtdru
ggnih06,t1_ggnepca,"Can you tell me how the necessity for validation is detrimental to my existence?

Especially if I've efficiently therapied myself to deal, that I can ""naturally"" empathize (conditioned), & also let go of interpersonally-exploitative ulterior motives?

Feel like these were the primary detriments of this condition. 

Some aspects of NPD.. Are some of them not ""fine""?",t3_khtdru
ggolrkk,t1_ggni598,"Correct me if I'm wrong but it all seems like you just asked what people think but don't want to talk about it with the ones who have a different opinion. What's the point then? Or maybe the fact that someone will agree and need you, is the validation itself. So basically its sort of manipulation to get more people to validate you.

Although I agree with the fact that it can help survive the day, its also just going deep into excuses. As for me, it's exactly surviving not living. I don't want to need that validation throughout my whole life. 

Speaking from my own experience, temporary validation is an easy get easy go, leaving the bigger void the more it gave me a moment before. For example. The more followers I will have on one of my ig accounts, the more likes I will need to feel my post being appreciated. Which is even more awful since I genuinely started both of my accounts for myself, to have a place with a specific type of memories and I avoid all the practice used as attention seekers do, on the platform.",t3_khtdru
ggov6yf,t1_ggni598,"That's not my disposition. I'm just curious. Do I seem melancholy to you? I feel just fine, and I think you're projecting or merely misinterpreting. But it's fine.

I'm not saying that this is bad, I have have concerns for your well-being. But if that's how you and you're fine, then we're all good.",t3_khtdru
ggoum8b,t1_ggnih06,"Everyone has some necessity to validation. That's human.

Embracing what appears to come across as somewhat of an addition to attention... well, I can't say that it's intrinsically bad but it does seem like it could easily be unhealthy. And the way you are offering resembles satire for some reason but I'm unsure exactly why. I'll have to think about that for a while.",t3_khtdru
ggovu0t,t1_ggolrkk,"I'd accept that the services offered have some emotional utility that can have a purely positive transaction, win/win

I'm just uncertain of how this is to be interpreted if it is more than just an offer but an expression, as there is a lot of information revealed about the user within the post. When you combine with the prompt, it resembles an AA meeting where everyone just hangs out and drinks beer. Yep, that's the satire I was thinking about. Totally inappropriate but funny to me.",t3_khtdru
ggvvo01,t1_ggoum8b,"Again I agree on the satire, sometimes it feels like some kind of ironic post-modern piece of reddit performance comedy or something.. But then again also it doesn't, I think it's too earnest for that.

I wonder if perhaps this is a case of the phenomenon that doesn't get enough attention because, frankly, it sounds too victim blamey, where people act absurdly to try to get made fun of and thus projectively identify their own self-mocking feelings into other people. As The Last Psychiatrist correctly observed many years ago, narcissists ""crowdsource the superego"" because other people, even when they're critical, are gentler than the narcissist will be to themselves.",t3_khtdru
gh4abag,t1_ggvvo01,"OK I have decided that it sounds like satire because TheGiraffeEater probably doesn't take herself too seriously, or doesn't take the NPD community here too seriously. One or the other or both. I don't think there's much intention behind the post, therefore it is as much a performance as it is what it claims to be.",t3_khtdru
