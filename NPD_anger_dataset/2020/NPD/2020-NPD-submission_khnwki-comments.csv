 > “decision around but ~~its~~ [**it's**] all we have”

It might be better if you, TrashyBowl1, had used “decision around but ~~its~~ [**it's**] all we have” instead. ‘Its’ is possessive; ‘it's’ means ‘it is’ or ‘it has’.

ggn3cin,t3_khnwki,"Reality television is based on reality? I thought it was all contrived garbage that preys upon the fact that people want to feel part of something that superficially appears actual. Even if it were completely authentic I doubt you'd be able to determine if someone ""rises up to the level of a diagnosis of NPD"" (using the term diagnosis to imply clinical relevance) based on the scenes of what is essentially a TV drama.",t3_khnwki
ggn7nim,t1_ggn3cin,Yeah that’s what I said in my last paragraph.,t3_khnwki
ggnakdx,t1_ggn7nim,"Then why would you expect anyone to answer yes to this question:

*"" do you believe his narcissism rises up to the level of a diagnosis of npd? ""*

In my opinion this kind of speculation is harmful to the social standing of people with the personality disorder. You're basically asking a community of people who have the condition if they think this TV personality also has it on the basis that he is kind of an arrogant asshole and nothing else.

**Also, your post is explicitly against RULE #2 of this subreddit.**",t3_khnwki
ggne4x6,t1_ggnakdx,"I think you take the world too seriously. We woke up one day and found ourselves in this weird globe with no mission or journey. We don’t know why we’re here or what or who put us here. All we know is that we’ll be gone in a bit. So Why spend that time being uptight and a party popper, have some fun? I know your probably gonna brush this off as a rando on Reddit being weird but don’t take things so seriously, because they really aren’t that serious.",t3_khnwki
ggowsv4,t1_ggne4x6,"No, I just think that reality is TV is trash and that was the whole motivation to respond. Everything else being petty. I regret nothing. You did break the rules though, which are short and simple.

All of us alive today have billions of years of ancestors, each that woke up one day and found themselves with a fairly clear journey. Survive in this world. Eventually life became complex, and we had brains. Survival became obsolete, and yet we still craved many things. We're going somewhere. And we're each part of it. It's more fun realise that you can't trivialise existence. We're just an extension of a very long chain of events and decision. It's fun.

If live is temporary (I agree) and this is all we've got (I agree) then we must have better things to do than watch Survivor.",t3_khnwki
