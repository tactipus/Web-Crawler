ghlhotv,t3_knn6mf,"If you don't mind sharing, what was your childhood like? How were you raised? What were your parents like? Who was your role model and how did he/she behave? 

I ask because me being a narcissist has its roots in how I was raised by my mom. I was the golden child, I looked similar to my mom so she favored me over my brother, I had no responsibilities besides school and yet was praised for doing anything, my mom would always overstep my boundaries by talking for hours on end or stand in the bathroom while I took a shower, my mom faked being ill for two years starting from when I got engaged (and therefore was now with another woman), my mom lied about my wife and supported a physical intervention aimed at ""saving"" me from my ""aderral-addicted"" wife (I convinced everyone that her behavior due to narc abuse was due to adderall rather than my narc behavior), the list goes on...

I'm not sure whether you have NPD, but I would think about your childhood and also read the DSM diagnostic criteria. The DSM isn't a one size fits all, but I think narcs can usually relate if they are self-aware enough (which I am still working on, but which you appear to be better at!). Lastly, one interesting thing I've read and have been told is that narcs generally don't question whether they have a problem, but then again I've also been told that narcs can never change...so who knows?!?
