ghnr83p,t3_knzj8q,"Afaik, it's common in NPD. I've had atypical depression, which feels more like numbness to everything rather than sadness you describe. I spent most days in bed, overeating and oversleeping. I still didn't feel guilt or self-hatred (at least not consciously). The best way I can describe it is just drifting along, bored with life.",t3_knzj8q
ghnf1aa,t3_knzj8q,"Narcissisism is positively correlated with depression. In certain cases, it can be a sign.",t3_knzj8q
ghobr7o,t3_knzj8q,"The depression that is part of NPD is typically more of what's often called emptiness depression -- which is different from mood disorder depression, which tends to be more about an over-abundance of guilt feelings and desire to always be trying to make up for imagined transgressions against others.",t3_knzj8q
ghovha0,t3_knzj8q,"50% of people with NPD have depression. 70% have some mood disorder, with the remaining 20% including bipolar which includes depression symptoms. It's correct to say most people with NPD have depression.

EDIT: I now can't find the article I had for this, and am seeing wildly differing numbers. Take above with big grain of salt.

EDIT2:Try this one - it seems ok. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237011577_Narcissistic_Personality_Disorder_Progress_in_Recognition_and_Treatment",t3_knzj8q
ghpvoe2,t3_knzj8q,"Very common for pwNPD to also have depression and anxiety disorders.  It is a detached empty, life is meaningless and there is no point to it type of depression. Anhedonia, loss of feelings and interest in things.",t3_knzj8q
gho4yct,t1_ghnr83p,Well shit ya kinda nailed it,t3_knzj8q
ghr03w3,t1_ghnr83p,"I also have atypical depression, it's dopamine related vs. other types of depression which are more serotonin related. It's like you have a lack of motivation, because your rewarding system is not working right..so there's no point in doing anything üòè are you better mow, how did you get out of it?",t3_knzj8q
ghnghij,t1_ghnf1aa,"I think both narcissism and depression can go hand in hand.

For me, I think I have a lot of guilt for the pain and destruction I have caused in my wife's life. I feel like I should be sad, but I also don't have many feelings because they were suppressed in my childhood by my narc mom. If I did have more feelings though, like some other narcs, then I can see myself being depressed at my actions.

Not quite sure if this will help, but maybe use your situation as an opportunity to get more in touch with your emotions? They say you can only feel the highest highs when you've felt the lowest lows. I can't really feel either, but I would like very much to experience a normal range of emotions and I will work at finding ways to do so to better understand others and myself.",t3_knzj8q
ghnhgzc,t1_ghnf1aa,I just don‚Äôt understand how it‚Äôs possible.. Doesnt NPD make you feel like the best person who does no wrong? And depression is the opposite.. so how could you have both,t3_knzj8q
ghocstg,t1_ghobr7o,"Wait isn‚Äôt normal depression a guilty feeling? It‚Äôs so confusing Bc the other comments say the opppsite

Edit: Oh wait I read your comment wrong haha. So having an abundance of guilt and need to makeup for imagined problems against others is the way not NPD get depression?",t3_knzj8q
ghrb7ts,t1_ghr03w3,"At some point I realized that the way I was living was no better than killing myself and rebelled at the thought. ""I don't *want* to harm myself, so wtf am I doing with my life?"" Somehow I just stopped identifying with the depressive mood, instead seeing as some parasite dragging me down. It obviously wasn't nearly enough to cure it, but it gave me a push to make the first step towards recovery. From then on, it took the standard combo of therapy and medication. Black and white thinking was by far the biggest hurdle. I still have to constantly remind myself that the goal is not perfection but doing better than yesterday. 

If you are anything like me, you might think you can beat it on your own. You are probably right, but why choose the hard way? If you want to improve your life as quickly and efficiently as possible, getting professional help is the best bet!",t3_knzj8q
ghnh2we,t1_ghnghij,"Do you have any oh-shit moments emotionally? Where it feels like the bottom may drop out of your world if you go there?

Could be alexithymia. Probably need a counselor to help you walk out of this one. Hold on to this motivation. If you stop  after placating your wife, the relationship will end. She may blindside you by getting up courage to leave after feeling miserable when you think things are better. Keep at it",t3_knzj8q
ghnlp9o,t1_ghnhgzc,"Grandiose comes with that kind of insulation from emotion.

But other forms? Not so much. If you are in a collapsed state, or just have traits, it's actually quite depressing to struggle with chronic narcisstic deficits and injuries. 

Someone said it's like building a rickety wooden house over a large chasm and calling that home. I was never allowed to have a self because of my family. They made it intensely dangerous for me to do so. As a result I've missed out on so much in life and suffered a lot. That's damn depressing. You move into depression without grandiosity. Narcissism is a spectrum with various factors like healing, ego support of current environment, degree of damage, other personality factors, etc.",t3_knzj8q
ghob70z,t1_ghnhgzc,"NPD is a manifestation of the manic defence (as described by the Kleinian psychoanalysts and by Donald Winnicott), going to the opposite, pretending to both oneself and to others, to feel great and awesome to cover a feeling, often unconscious or mostly unconscious, of feeling deeply insecure and inadequate.",t3_knzj8q
ghupl6w,t1_ghnh2we,"I don't have ""oh shit moments,"" although I wish I really did. I'm just barely getting in touch with buried emotions to find the motivation to do something for someone (my wife) other than myself. I am very luck that my wife stays with me, even though I will never be deserving of her and her life would've been better if she had never met me. Thank you for the encouragement",t3_knzj8q
ghpq6qw,t1_ghob70z,"Winnicott... thank you. This insight lends itself to something that i apparently must read. A guy i had been dating recently referenced Winnicott, and given my studies on the subject matter, this is something i‚Äôve overlooked. 

I appreciate your insight and am interested in learning more.",t3_knzj8q
ghv1wil,t1_ghupl6w,"Don't discount yourself too much. ‚ù§Ô∏è I've dated a few insulated people, and I valued them a lot for many reasons. You are more than your diagnosis. If she wants to stay, then fight this with her. Who knows what lessons you'll find at the bottom and be able to bring back to others.",t3_knzj8q
