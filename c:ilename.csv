When someone is angry at me and says things in a certain way, instead of listening to them I lash out and escalate the situation, making them even more upset. I was told that what I do is tone policing. I think I do this because I perceived it as an insult. I find it difficult to be sympathetic or understanding of someone when they snap at me, are short with me, are visibly annoyed, etc.",11
3,I've realised I don't feel anger,9,pqzus1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/pqzus1/ive_realised_i_dont_feel_anger/,22,1632019614.0,"Hi,

Throwaway account for obvious reasons. Not diagnosed NPD but pretty sure I am, or at least have traits. 

As a kid and early teenager I was really naughty and I guess had a temper. Quite rebellious etc. Now I'm always trying to please people (to a fault). 

I've realised that as an adult, I never get angry. I'm not sure exactly when I stopped feeling anger. I do feel some other emotions (at least envy, self-pity, frustration and guilt) but noticeably anger is missing.

Can anyone else relate to this? I think anger is probably a healthy emotion to feel sometimes, so the fact I don't concerns me. Did anyone find anything that can help?",9

5,Dealing with anger outbursts,5,pr8h3e,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/pr8h3e/dealing_with_anger_outbursts/,0,1632060041.0,"Hi,

What are everyone’s tips for dealing with anger outbursts that stem from entitlement?

I always regret whenever I have one and am repulsed by my behaviour as it reminds me of my father, who has this inherent sense of insolent pride.

Yet I don’t know any techniques that can help me when I’m in these situations.

I seem to have no shame in raising my voice or making someone feel fear if I feel I’ve been wronged, slighted or if someone has done their job incompetently.

E.g today I thought the bus driver lost my suitcase and I went insane, turns out it was somewhere else and I could’ve just remained calm.

The ‘scene’ that I made was definitely beyond what was needed.
It’s like in those moments I’m running on something I can’t control.

This is maybe not a good example as it could be written off as mere anger issues and not NPD, but it’s the way in which I treat people as if they’re not human — people I don’t even know.

I have seen therapists before although not specifically for anger management, I know that would be a good logical step, but I wondered if anyone had has some practical tips or resources to share?

Thanks",5

She suggested the role I was playing in my family growing up was to get upset about all the problems no one else was addressing. She said that by getting upset, I was actually doing the emotional work for them, so they didn’t have to deal with it (unconsciously ofc). They could say I was just crazy and completely ignore the problems at hand. This makes sense to me.

So. Apparently, I would lash out because of problems not being addressed due to neglect. So all these years, my anger has been valid...

But, it’s obvious my behavior and reactions to that anger is “inappropriate” and I HATE that word, because *i* feel my anger is appropriate. It makes me feel so invalidated. And yet, there’s obviously a problem. I want to face that problem without submitting to the idea that I’ve just been crazy. I want to feel valid. But it’s really hard when my family still treats me like I’m crazy. I’m SO sensitive, and yet I hate to say that because truthfully, I’ve just been gaslit into thinking that. 

But also...EVERYTHING upsets me. Tiny amounts of disrespect put me into a rage. I’m just so angry and exhausted. This stuff is so hard, but I think I’m improving slowly.",11

Then again she wasn't diagnosed like me so maybe she just misidentified herself as NPD. It wouldn't super surprise me. Or maybe I'm just gatekeeping lmao

9,Stop Beating Yourselves Up: A Communique,75,r2oqc0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/r2oqc0/stop_beating_yourselves_up_a_communique/,27,1637937100.0,"I've read enough of the navel-gazing in this subreddit to see a common pattern. NPDs here beat themselves up for past abusive behavior, lack of empathy, self-centeredness, and so on.

The truth is, a lot of non-mentally ill people in the world don't have affective empathy either. If they did, then we wouldn't see things like genocide or homelessness. What, you think all the Hutus that murdered all those Tutsis in Rwanda were NPD or ASPD? Beating yourself up for something that a lot of normies don't even have is not only counterproductive, it's also self-absorbed. Woe-is-me kind of shit. Typical of vulnerable narcissism.

What separates us from the normies is that normies hold themselves accountable (for the most part) and they stay true to certain values like kindness in their daily lives (for the most part). A lot of narcs around here don't seem to have any values at all beyond being famous, wealthy, or having a bunch of groupies. 

Even the narcs that seem regretful: no real values. The narcs that castigate themselves see themselves as unfixable. Let's be honest: if you work hard, you can be kind, considerate, and trustworthy in the long run. You might even have intimate and loving relationships. Enough of the pity parties, guys. Go to therapy, adopt some values to guide you through tough times, and work on being considerate in spite of your impaired empathy.",75

I am usually a pretty calm person but there are incidents where I can experience narcissistic rage. it's pretty rare and only happened twice in the past few years. but it's usually the same situation: I am vulnerable and trusting of someone and then I find out that person lied to me over a period of time and/or betrayed me with someone else.

something that anyone would be angry about I suppose. but the pain this specific situation brings me is so overwhelming, that it can almost immobilize me for a few days and usually drops me into a suicidal spiral and intense rage.
I don't let it out on anyone but it boils in me and kind of eats me from the inside

what hurts me the most is a) the fact that I was lied to and believed it and b) that there is another person they chose, that is ""better"" than me.

I'm pretty sure the reason this pain feels like it almost rips me apart physically is because the underlying emotion is shame. and thats like what npd is mostly based on.

the thing is, in these situations I have a very hard time coming out of it. when it happened in 2018 it took me about a year to function again. there was a S attempt and I had to go to a clinic for a few months. the anger only slowly subsided.

now I'm in a similar situation and everytime I think about it my nerves feel like they are filled with hot water. and thats basically constantly.

I am very angry but also resigned because I know I have no way to get ""justice"".

I try to deal with this in a logical way but as of right now it feels impossible. I can try to calm down a little but the second I think about it again the paralyzing pain comes back.

any tipps? insight? ways to deal with the chronic shame inside us?",11

16,Impulsiveness and emotionality. Does anyone also have a problem distinguishing between these concepts?,4,qy6dkb,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/qy6dkb/impulsiveness_and_emotionality_does_anyone_also/,11,1637417499.0," For a long time I have described myself as ""very emotional"". I considered myself to be so. By this I meant that I often react quickly, spontaneously and ""follow my heart"" or my intuition/gut feeling without considering the pros and cons.  In one word, I do what I want on the spur of the moment. Now I think it's more impulsiveness than emotionality, although I still don't get the exact difference. Or is it that emotionality is not about action, and impulsivity is primarily about reacting by doing? I don't know, maybe someone can understand it better and explain it to me. Because I'm more and more sure that I was wrong, that is, I was mistaking these concepts ...And if I told myself I should be ""less emotional"", it was rather that I wanted to be less impulsive. But are these concepts not related to each other?

>Emotionality is the observable behavioral and physiological component of emotion, and is a measure of a person's emotional reactivity to a stimulus. Most of these responses can be observed by other people, while some emotional responses can only be observed by the person experiencing them.  
>  
>Impulsivity is a multifactorial construct that involves a tendency to act on a whim, displaying behavior characterized by little or no forethought, reflection, or consideration of consequences. Impulsive actions typically are ""poorly conceived, prematurely expressed, unduly risky, or inappropriate to the situation that often result in undesirable consequences,"" which imperil long term goals and strategies for success. A functional variety of impulsivity has also been suggested, which involves action without much forethought in appropriate situations that can and does result in desirable consequences. ""When such actions have positive outcomes, they tend not to be seen as signs of impulsivity, but as indicators of boldness, quickness, spontaneity,

17,What's the Deal with Masking?,6,roj4d4,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/roj4d4/whats_the_deal_with_masking/,14,1640472018.0,"I feel like many people on this subreddit have this neurosis about masking.

I don't understand why. Masking is needed for our kind of society to function. If your boss pisses you off at work by assigning you to work over the weekend, you don't curse out your boss. You suck it up, smile, and work. Well, you can quit or organize a union, but that's for another day. ;)

Likewise, you narcissistic peeps have to cover up your grandiosity, envy, or whatever. That's not bad. That's just a survival skill. If you get entitlement rage, are you gonna display your anger and drive people away? Of course not.

Be advised that *masking* is similar but different from *image management*. You can manage your image through masking negative feelings. That way, people won't think you're neurotic. I suppose that masking is a technique that helps you manage your image.

18,Vehicle for Hatred,9,rsdrpm,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/rsdrpm/vehicle_for_hatred/,6,1640902449.0,"Sometimes I feel like I am a vehicle of hell and hate. It's gotten to the point where that's all I really feel. 

Fear, anger, jealousy, and lust but that's not really an emotion in my book, just a need to release something and let my thoughts melt away and get horny tunnel vision for a few minutes until its replaced with cold sickness. I have a need for violence. Orgasmic fast violence, to myself and others. My head impacting with some hard red object at the speed of an ejaculation, my teeth embedding themselves in it and ripping out of my mouth leaving a hilarious gummy open mouth smile, my eyeballs embedding themselves too but they stay attached to the socket so when my head rushes back from the sheer force of it they stretch back. Its happens so fast that everything overlaps each other like frames in a cartoon, it happens in the blink of an eye. I can see it clearly. There's an orange sky behind me. And I'm smiling. When I think of that I feel a little loose in my legs, brings a little shiver to my spine, it's the kick I need, it brightens my day. Maybe if I was more violent I'd be more close to myself. If I lost everything, every bit of self control, and slammed someones head into a wall I would wake up from my coma. Just one violent act would make everything make sense. I'd break down crying. 

Does anyone else indulge themselves in success fantasies that titillate them but then when you think too long about them, they start to become terrifying? Does anyone else feel like they'd be happier if they just accepted being a loser and stopped chasing things, but also stopped relying on other people for anything? Disappear from the people you know and love and the people who's eyes you imagine when they are not near you, go somewhere where no one knows you or there is no one there to know you, stop talking to others and overtime stop talking to yourself and then just, blip. In the nothing, the big white light in your head will sink down to the size of a slowly spinning, small pulsing dying star, and then it will sink down more and more and more until it disappears. 

And then you'll walk out of the forest and you won't remember a thing about yourself, you won't remember a thing about your past or your present or your future, you won't understand those concepts to begin with, you won't know words or bodies or actions, you won't know and you won't care. You will walk out, and your mind will start over. Unmolded. And on the way back to nothing, you'll be molded only by the woods you walk through. And it will heal you and it will build you stronger walls. 

 Cover yourself in dirt and shit and grime. Being nothing feels like the only way to be happy.

20,Vent,3,rqlydt,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/rqlydt/vent/,4,1640715329.0," I posted an insta story asking if anyone would like to invite me to a/their Sylvester party.. well 30 ppl read it and I got no answer. To add to that I'm the kid who never gets invited anywhere, an I mean NEVER. Growing up I've never had a friend group, now I have no one that I feel emotionally close to. Also the fact that they do this partying  and friendship thing implies that they're better than me which is something I can NOT let happen. 

Like wtf am I doing wrong? I don't look bad, I maintain proper hygiene and I'm smart, smarter than kost of them (IQ) and I act friendly towards everyone and even pretend to care about what they're saying. So why am I always the worst or the last choice or simply the girl that gets overlooked?
And honestly, I don't know I should feel about that: I've already thought about multiple scenarios that I could initiate:

1. I pretend to be very mentally unwell (which I am btw) and thus score sympathy points just like I tried from the 7th grade on where I was considering jumping out of the window and having the fantasy that someone would stop me and everyone would dramatically gather around me and shower me with apologies and sympathy.... but it didn't work so I'm not certain that it will this time

2. Isolation. Completely retreat from society and play the 'mysterious loner' that means on new years eve I'll go into the city on my own, buy myself a bottle of wine and proceed to drink it while sitting sad on a bench or something. I'd start going to the gym again and maybe they'll finally pay attention when I look better than all of them (now I'm about half way there) Like why do I not have a boyfriend? I'm skinny, have visible abs and my face is not that bad too but for some reason I've never even had my first kiss. Plus hearing people rank about whom they've already made out with at my age makes my blood boil, like 'why does this not happen to me' and 'now I am even lower on the social hierarchy and look even worse in front of everyone'
Also btw am somewhat incompetent at maintaining relationships since idk what the hell people talk about. Is it life experiences? Too bad, because I remember almost nothing before 10th grade (13years). Like how do people keep that up? I seriously wanna know? Because in one hand, my therapist told me that affective empathy is only possible if you like yourself, even though a lot of people dont like themselves and they still got friends somehow. Hell, some don't even deserve the amount of friends they have which means at even those who are much less worth than me still have a better social life.

3. Revenge: The amount of anger I feel is pretty high ngl, which is kinda weird because I feel both like I can't feel any anger but then at the same time I have the urge to tell them to just go fuck themselves and get revenge for what they've done which may make them fear me which in return finally gives me some ounce of respect and maybe then ppl will start to associate with me.
Because for some reason I don't care about emotional intimacy, because you can just fake it and because I know that that'll never happen to me lol and the othe. And furthermore friendships or specifically having a social life kinda builds this image of yourself in which you are worth something because you're somewhat high in the social hierarchy which ofc makes you look good and thus you're better than other (which is like my only legitimate goal in life, to be better than those people I come in contact with and yes it's unrealistic but still, can't allow myself to be worse no matter which aspect of life lmaooo)

Holy damn this was long.. if you made it to here: wow you're bored/ but also thank you cause I feel that this is the only place where I can vent my thoughts that some would probably understand . 

FYI IM NOT CLINICALLY DIAGNOSED!! I just feel like almost everything in this the most relatable shit I've heard lol so// also because I'm a minor too

21,I don't know if I am a narcissist or not,7,pn9xl3,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/pn9xl3/i_dont_know_if_i_am_a_narcissist_or_not/,43,1631514305.0,"Ok so I think I may have NPD or some traits of it. I will list some reasons why I think I may have NPD:

1. I HEAVILY rely on fantisies ( I actually think about myself like this almost all the time) so I can idealize myself.
2. I go from thinking I am better than everyone and comparing myself to other people to thinking I am worthless and deserve to die or something like that
3. If there is one thing that I heavily base my self esteem off of (smarts, being able to make anyone like me ) that turns out not to be true, I have a breakdown. Like, I literally feel SOOO uncomfortable with myself and because of this, I can't go into my fantasy world which I need/use so much, making the breakdown all the more worse.
4. I had an upbringing where my parents fought all the time (tried to kill each other, but for awhile I got used to it), I was in contact with the legal system all the time) I felt like my mom looked down on me ( in a pitying oh she's so pathetic, poor thing way) and my dad relied on me for emotional support like there was no tomorrow ages 6-11 ( also called parentification) and neglected me from the ages of 0-5. When ever I testified in court ( I was 11 when I testified, about the time my parents got the most violent towards each other) about who I would live with, my mom and dad ( in a much more covert way) CONSTANTLY guilt-tripped me into picking them ( I remember a conversation with my mom and I had after I went out with my dad, she basically said that I was a bad person for ""choosing dad"", I was 10 by the way.
5. I had serious codependecy issues when I was 10, I ""dated"" someone who was abusive and said things like ""go fuck yourself"" toward the end ( he felt insulted) when my mom broke up with him for me (over text, so he thought it was me). And then he went off to his little friends and a called me a bitch and told his friends his version of the story to make them hate me, it worked. I was bullied, but in a different way than you expect ( spreading rumors, gossiping about me). All of this made me develop social anxiety and being paranoid and distrustful.
6. When I was 11 I felt like a completely different person, like a switch had been flipped. I was VERY envious, angry, resentful, very easily offended, had a serious victim complex, wrathful, and hateful. I was angry because I felt like the world was against me, that someone like that could win and I would always lose, that everything I wanted depended on people who had all the power in the world against me, that people could do whatever they wanted to me and they would never be punished, not even by me.....
7. When I was 11 1/2  the issues above continued but I had one more thing to deal with, on top of him and his friends, severe depression and suicidal thoughts. I had to deal with these because I was grieving over the loss of a childhood that I never had and never will, but I couldn't face that fact, I turned to delusions.
8. When I was 12 I had assigned myself the mission of defeating him (socially). But it was different than from the time I had been 11 1/2, it was like another switch had been flipped, one of constant happiness seeking, and self- esteem ( more like grandiosity) seeking. I was not depressed, I was not hateful, I did not feel unloved, I felt no pain, I just felt high. High from everything I had been doing to feel good, high because in my mind, if could be just as bad as him (which made me feel good), I could be his equal ( because he taught me that was what an equal was), we could be bad together, I thought.
9. My empathy works a little different: Whenever I see someone who is going through what I went through, I have empathy, but I have to be in their emotional state myself at the exact same time, otherwise I have no idea what they are feeling and cannot empathise.   Or, I am going through a breakdown and disregard other people's emotions.
10. I think of myself in the 3rd person often (""oh she's so amazing"")
11. I feel attacked and lash out at people who make feel socially stupid ( I am EXTREMELY insecure about this, and will literally think of killing myself if I feel like that).
12. I self harm and have mood swings
13. I have a lot of paranoia sometimes
14. I like it when people feed my victim complex.
15. I feel entitled to be mean and passive aggressive when I'm angry.
16. I feel VERY uncomfortable with love and confessing any emotion to anyone.
17. I don't percieve someone as the same person I normally would when I am angry with them.
18. I go from idealizing other people and not thinking highly of them quickly
19. I have a very unstable view of other people, if they do one thing that looks even a little suspicious, I question their entire character.
20. Sometimes when I have breakdowns, I question my sanity, my view of reality and my character

So basically, I'm not diagnosed with NPD, but my psychiatrist says I have strong traits, and from what I've researched I am the definition of a covert narcissist. Also I'm dyslexic so the spelling and grammar is horrible. The first bit is just background for context and not necessary to read:

Background (not super important): 

I'll give some background. 2 years ago I started dating my ex boyfriend (we are both in our early 20s, I'm a female). He was really sweet, had some mental health problems, and 'fell in love' with me almost immediately. He had allot of relationship anxiety and unhealthy attachment issues, and so did I. We dated for a bit over a year. In this time I completely lied about everything. I pretty much reinvented myself to match someone he would want. At first I didn't really like him, but soon fell in love and I became completely obsessed with him. Our relationship was super intense and unhealthy, as we both had so many issues, but at its basis I really do think I loved him. I loved spending time with him, I loved talking to him etc. but now I'm starting to wonder if I actually loved him, or was it just obsession because I had no one else and I liked the way he made me feel. I'm not sure. 

I had immense relationship anxiety, but I'm starting to realise that allot of what I thought was 'anxiety' was just moments where I couldn't control him, and these moment where I had no control over him, and I felt powerless made me anxious.

He thought I was the sweetest, most honest, girlfriend ever, when in reality it was just a facade. I was super toxic and manipulative, and was really good at hiding it. I would purposefully go out of my way to invent stories about guys flirting with me, made up exes, told him I had pervious relationships even if he was my first, show him pics of guys I had things with in the past that were hotter than him to make him insecure. All of this just to make him jealous and insecure. To create this image that I was hot shit. I was using dating apps and talking to guys I had things with in the past throughout the entire relationship, purely for attention, and moments when I was super anxious and thought he was cheating on me. At its basis all the things I would do were because I was just so insecure, but wanted to feel like I had power and control over the situation.

I had just moved to a new city when I met him, and didn't know anyone. I had a few friends, but all of them knew a 'different' part of me, as I just mirror the people that I'm around, plus I was embarrassed of them and was scared that my ex would not like them or think they were 'cool' enough. So he never met any of them. I made up so many people and friends, would talk to him about people that didn't exist just so he thought I was super popular. I also grew up in a different country, and never made friends there either (because I'm clearly just not a pleasant person and everyone irritates me after a while), but would still make people up so he thought I was this super popular person in highschool, when I was actually the lame, weirdo with  no friends. It was easy to keep all of this and my family hidden, as there was lockdown. I was terrified he would meet my family or anyone I knew and find out about all my lies. 

We dated for a bit over a year, until I ended up cheating on him with his brother. This happened a year ago. I had met his brother briefly once, he was older and didn't live in the same city as us. The night before I cheated, I went to a party with my ex, his brother, and some of their friends and cousins. That night I became obsessed with the brother. I felt drawn to him, like we had something that others didn't (I think he has NPD too actually). The day after, I saw him again and kissed him. I initiated it. That night my ex wasn't there, but there were some of their friends, and obviously his brother. I was completely drunk, and on allot of drugs (was the first time in the relationship I had ever taken drugs). I can't remember allot, but apparently the way I acted, and the stuff I said made the brother and his friends realise and tell my ex that I'm a sociopath. 

Background (a bit more important):

Looking back the emotions I felt after I cheated were not normal. I don't think I felt any empathy for him. I felt allot of shame. So much shame that my mask was ripped off. That people close to him saw the 'real me'. So basically all I have been doing since the cheating is trying to make my ex see me for who he thought I was, not who his brother is telling him I am. I told him I would start super intensive therapy to fix myself so we could get back together. In reality my intention for starting therapy had nothing to do with me trying to fix myself, it was to do with the fact that I wanted him to think I was, so he would take me back. I put on this personal to my new therapist, to come across as super innocent, that it was all a mistake. I would have my ex sit in the room while I had my therapist on loudspeaker over the phone, I would feed my therapist shit, so that I knew he would reply telling me how great I was, how much improvement I had made etc. all just so my ex would hear. It worked for several months, he was still completely obsessed with me. I would always tell him how we should stop talking and seeing each-other, how what I did was so fucked up, that I wanted to become a better person before we got back together. But I didn't mean any of it, it was just to see if he would fight for me. And he did. He would beg for me to stay. I was still tell him I was hanging out with all these guys so he would be jealous, still do all this manipulative shit even after I cheated. Through all this we were never officially dating again, but  acting like we were (he was keeping it hidden from everyone). After a while I think that the reality of what I did hit, and he decided he wanted to properly end things. Before he was always saying how in a few months we'd get together, that I was the one, that he was sure we would end up together as we're meant to be. Then he started saying how he didn't know if we would ever even end up together, that it was life, and shit happens. He started seeing the whole situation from a more mature place. I think his family also really ingrained this idea in his head that I was a sociopath. We went a few months without talking, however always end up talking and seeing eachother. But there's no desperation on his part anymore. He takes ages to reply, I have to literally beg him to come over, he only really talks to me or wants to see me when he's depressed or lonely. I'm still now I'm manipulating him.

Important part:

Now to the important part. A month after I cheated I did a shit tonne of psychedelics for the first time. It was horrible. The entire trip was just hallucinations telling me how I'm rotten to my core, my blood isn't pure, I come from a line of people whose blood is in-pure. That the only way to stop this was to kill myself. I was super freaked out after, but ignored it. A month after that I smoked allot of weed, and relived the entire experience in more detail. It made me realise so many behaviours I had that were not ok. Then I while after I smoked again, and again realised even more stuff. Before this I honestly thought I was a good person with good intentions lol. Around 6 months ago is when I started doing allot of research into my behaviours, joining this forum, researching about NPD etc. and I realised that this is what I have. That I lie, I manipulate, I'm a completely empty vessel, I just mirror then discard people when I don't need them anymore, I only care about myself and how I appear to others, nothing in my life or about me is real, because I live in a world of fantasies 99% of these time, I think I'm so superior when in reality I am and have nothing. All of these things, I have. When I first realised I completely broke down. I told my mum everything (she completely denied it and said that there's no way I have NPD. That's just how good my mask is). I started telling my therapist the truth, and we started working on it. I became completely suicidal, realising that I'm the reason that my life has always been horrible and I have no one. Then I would forget about it and stop going on this forum, and I'd be ok for a while. I kept repeating these cycles of forgetting all about NPD, and being ok in myself, and becoming obsessed with NPD, and wanting to kill myself. The thing is now, when I think about the stuff I did to my ex I actually think I DO feel empathy. He was such a pure soul and I hurt him so much. I physically feel how I hurt him inside of me. However, I still can't stop myself manipulating him. I've for sure gotten better, but I still lie to him about so much in regards to the cheating and myself, just to preserve the mask. He's the one I have it the worst with, because the mask I present him is complete lies. This brings me to last week, where I started watching documentaries of criminal psychiatrists braking down serial killers profiles, and psychopath's behaviours in interviews. And I do all the things they do. Everything they point in regards to their  manipulations, is stuff I do. Everything down to the rehearsing, the facial expressions, the tone, playing the victim, being charming. Everything. It's me. And now I'm terrified that I will do something like that one day. That I will actually truly hurt someone. Loose it and kill someone. I'm confused though because when I hear about what they did, I do feel empathy and feel completely sick. But what if I loose it one day, in the moment so blinded my anger that I kill or hurt someone. I have also been going on the narcissistic abuse subreddit allot, and it's been fucking with me. Reading these stories and how the behaviours of the people they talk about  are just as mine, realising how fucked up it is hearing from it from the other side. It brings me so much shame, and I think also  empathy for the people effected. At the same time, when I read it, I look back at my behaviours with my ex, making sure that I hid them well enough for him to never realise that I'm also a manipulative narcissist. I want. to get better so bad. Stop hurting people. Have a stable life. Not constantly live in fear that someone will find out about my many lies. I don't know what to do. No matter how hard I try I feel like at it's rooted in me. I have literally always been like this, and I think I always be, it's how I'm programmed and it scares me. I feel like I should never interact with anyone ever again to ensure I don't hurt anyone again or get found out (my biggest fear).",28

Source: Diana Diamond [https://youtu.be/3PoZtEX8PKE?t=581](https://youtu.be/3PoZtEX8PKE?t=581)

I was just wondering if it's hard to explain Narcissistic Rage in vivid detail for anyone else. 

Personally, I think the way I rage (suffer) is extremely hard to describe and I indeed find it hard to articulate. It happened to me one week ago. 

* It lasted for about 4 days. I could not calm down for 4 days. I was thinking about the source of the injury for about 5+ hrs per day, could be 10. 
* All the time I kept thinking to myself: *this is irrational, out of proportion anger. Continuing to ruminate on this is not productive and I should have had enough 5 hours ago, yet I still can't stop raging, looks like I won't be able to fall asleep.* 
* Tons of weed do not help. Weed makes me fantasize more...
* ...and I have fantasies of aggression. Like, fantasies of power plays, ruining somebody in my workplace, uniting people against someone, physical destruction... But mostly, fantasies about ""what I could've said better. How else I could've won the argument"". It's not like I didn't win the recent argument. I just had to win it 50 more times in my mind...
* ...and re-living the events in the form of fantasies means that I am constantly in the argument, thus the conflict is not over, rage is prolonged...
* I also often wonder ""wtf am I feeling right now"". ""Is it anger? Am I sad? Am I anxious? wtf exactly is this?""
* I am trying to identify my feelings and emotions so that I can navigate them, but I fail to do so. They are strong as hell, but they are hard to understand. ""I think it's anger. But wait, if it was anger, I would feel it in my body more... it seems to be going in my mind only... is it grief? Am I grieving? Am I suffering from a loss? Maybe I am envious of something? When was the last time I was envious, how did it feel, is it similar to what I'm experiencing right now?""
* I mean, really, I wish I could know what I feel. 
* Perception of time (sense of time) is slightly off. I've been lying down and thinking for 5 minutes, I look at the clock and am shocked to realize that it was 2 hours.
* ""Why am I so fixated on this? Why do I care so much?""",12

I know it's exaggerated but no amount of rational logic can make me feel better about it. I can't break things or other people because I need them and deep down I want them and probably want to break them in a way to break myself. Tonight I really wanted to just get fucked up and fuck off because the only ways I want to let out my anger are unproductive, unrealistic, illegal (like that's ever stopped me), or just straight up evil (don't even get me started on the bone that I have to pick about my cruel thoughts). i didn't end up doing drugs but instead I stayed up 5 hours longer than I should have and my head hurts more.

I want him to tell me how interesting  what I said is but instead he always turns it to some other related fact about the topic. It's as if he wants to one up my fact about it with another fact of his. I don't think that's what he's intending to do but its how I feel. It pisses me off and I sit there annoyed trying to get him to acknowledge me but it never feels like he is. Is this potentially a sign of NPD? I'm really sensitive to criticism and I feel different from everyone else. Kind of like they all are able to connect with each other in a way I can't. I realize the relationships I like are ones where the other person admires me for some reason and I can't really get close to people otherwise (unless I'm involved romantically). I have a hard time being equal to someone else. I feel like I have to be in a position where they need me to help them or that they admire me. I don't know if I'm being irrational but I get really angry and hurt when it happens and I usually hang up then go on to say outloud how much I hate him to the empty room (even though I don't mean it)

31,Let’s be real about the suffering that comes with NPD,110,paupuh,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/paupuh/lets_be_real_about_the_suffering_that_comes_with/,31,1629834331.0,"I don’t think most people will be able to be real with me on here or understand and relate what I have to say because we are all at different stages of self awareness, but oh well I’m still going to post anyway. Also a lot of people on here also only have traits and are not diagnosed like me. And I understand that. But I’m talking about the internal suffering of what it’s like to be a true pathological narcissist. At least when you’ve had an ego death like I have, it finally uncovers all the suffering. 

I bet you thought one of the first things I would mention “suffering from” is “insecurity”, because there’s this whole gag about narcissists secretly being insecure. Let me tell you, I don’t feel insecure at all. I love myself intensely, to the point  I feel incredibly superior daily, (feeling like I have achieved enlightenment has only made this more intense if anything). But I’m absolutely tortured internally. 

No let’s talk about missing out on my entire childhood, completely. I had a really warped, disturbing fucking childhood and there’s so much numbed suffering there that even slightly re-discovering it in therapy as I am now, is incredibly horrific. 

Growing up without ever experiencing love or safety. Nothing was safe and now you’re constantly on high alert, you can never truly relax, 24/7, on such high alert that you lash out at things that have nothing to even do with you. You’re exhausted.

And lets not discount all the blacked out gaps in memory spanning years and years, the bittersweet never-ending feeling of emptiness, the realization that you don’t have a core, and even if you do, it’s warped beyond belief and the internal experience is so uncomfortable. Fragmented.

Let’s not forget the realization that you don’t know what the fuck will happen to you if you go in to therapy, because no narcissist has really come out the other side. They all quit, and then their “disorder” completely overtakes them by the time they’re in their 60s and they become a walking personification of narcissism itself with nothing else to them. And you wonder if that’s going to be you too but you know you can’t stay in this hell.

And what about the anxiety? For me PTSD and GAD, and after my ego death it turned into full-blown Depersonalization disorder. 
The nightmares every night, how you can fall asleep but yet you never really get a good nights rest. If you don’t have an actual nightmare, you wake up sweating from night terrors instead. 

Or you just wake up feeling empty and not quite right. Dreams of wandering forever through wastelands completely forgotten by the world, dreams of being trapped in-between the floorboards of abandoned houses rotting out in the woods, never be found. Reoccurring dreams of overflowing waste or just filth for some fucking reason, dreams of fragmented childhood memories that make the sleep experience incredibly uncomfortable and make no sense, and you just wish you could get some fucking rest. 

And what about the anger? Man that used to be what I felt was such a strength. My anger, I was so good at protecting myself, but what happens when you’re like me and accidentally get yourself into an ego death, and then you find out that half the time you’re angry, you’re actually misperceiving the world. You’re feeling insulted for no reason. You’re misperceiving. 

The realization that you’re going to have to work through bouts of rage the rest of your life that can easily destroy others with the blink of an eye, i mean if you actually want connection in life so be prepared for that. Knowing you have to constantly watch yourself and second guess, just to see what the hell’s really going on. 

What about how it feels to not ever know what you’re feeling at any given moment in time? That you don’t know how to name your own emotions because they’ve been so repressed you can’t understand what the fuck you’re feeling. A lot of times you don’t feel anything at all anyway. Not much. Just kind of... dull imitations of feelings.

What about the complete and utter lack of passion. There’s just nothing in the world that interests you outside of yourself. All the human causes this world has to offer, all the beauty and strife, it’s mostly just boredom that you’re left with. 

Unless of course you’re having a dramatic day and everything is revolving around you. Everything‘s super exciting and people are all over you. Why is that the only time life feels worth it? Oh yeah and on that note we can add in the depression that results from pretty much all of this. 

Now this, this is NPD. At least this is what it is for me. This is the dark side of it. 

People online, all these “narcissistic abuse gurus” who think they know jack shit, it just makes me laugh. They’re so blind. They’re more surface-level and shallow than I was before I was diagnosed, and that’s saying a lot.

But I’m not going to go without listing how good I feel sometimes. How strong being a narcissist makes me. The strongest. I have literally defeated unspeakable things that would have caused most people to break down or lose their shit. I have overcome the worst circumstances a child could’ve been given, I have completely re-created myself into everything I loved and admired, and I am successful at work, I am adored by pretty much everyone I meet. I’m charming. I’m extremely good looking (off my own hard work to be that) and I usually get what I want. 

I’m capable of taking on things that many people are not. I am ambitious and smart as hell, and my emotions don’t get in the way of my decisions which makes me very clearheaded and able to accomplish a lot more than many.

But let’s just for a moment give light to what being a narcissist is really like. 

Because in terms of the amount of hate and the horrific things I have seen online, the complete invalidation that people like me experience when facing the world, 

(there are articles out there claiming that narcissists don’t even suffer or have real emotions, articles detailing how ppl can MAKE them suffer too on top of it all, just to give you an example) 

and with all the misinformation spread far and wide, I would go as far as to say this is the most misunderstood thing on the planet.

If i’m mad i wont show unless i’m 1 on 1 with someone or i’m at my house or similar place. 

Of course then there’s disgust which is common because i think of others as inferior and weird

These people have just as much toxic anger as narcissists but they stow it away until it explodes. And when it does, they want you to feel pain believe me. The codependent person I know admitted to me that when he was angry, he wanted me to feel exactly the way he does at that point. (Like shit, destroyed.) It’s like he doesn’t even recognize me at that point.

And when they do get upset, it’s usually a result of something simple you did that triggered their mountainous trauma that they refuse to face because they’re so busy being the victims and feeling depressed for themselves. And even worse, they feel the full range of guilt and shame and then they’ll blame that on you too when THEY lash out at you, because they can’t handle feeling it themselves. Many of them can’t handle being seen as an angry person so all the anger is blamed on me. 

When they get angry it’s full on abuse. They also project all their insecurities onto you during fights as well and telling you that you’re making them feel like a burden or abandoning them, when you didn’t say that at all.

They also basically can’t do barely anything for themselves and expect others to do it and when others don’t they get panicky and controlling. Then they are “horrified” by why people avoid them or why the help is never enough and why “no one cares”. They also won’t even ask for help in the first place because they’re embarrassed but then just magically expect you to know what they need.
Why are these people the flipside of narcissists and why am I so done

I used to have very little self-awareness. When I wasn't attuned to my inner states, anger felt like flipping a switch. I was calm one second and the next I was flipping out. The truth is that I wasn't ""calm"" but completely disconnected from my emotions until they got too intense to ignore. At that point, any attempt at self-restraint or appeal to logic was useless.

When I started seeking therapy, at first I was suggested to do CBT but for someone alexithymic such as me, it was too frustrating. In my case, keeping a journal worked far better.

This is how I'd usually write about my day: I'd start merely describing the situation that had elicited a strong emotion or conflict, and what had led to it. Then I'd start writing a list of plausible explanations, whether I agreed those were the cause or not. I paid special attention to those that either clicked with me as in 'oh, that makes sense!' and those who elicited strong negative reactions such as 'no fucking way!'. Kind of like trying to reverse-engineer my feelings.

Keeping a journal helped me in these ways:

* It made me more vigilant of my emotions, since I knew I had to write about them later. It started as a conscious effort, but it became easier eventually.
* It led me to realize that most of my outburst were preceded by jealousy, shame, indignation, or disappointment.
* It helped me pinpoint the early signs of an anger outburst. This is useful to find ways to resolve the anger before it becomes unmanageable. For example, I noticed that many of my outbursts started by relentlessly questioning the other person. I didn't know why I did it, but I knew I did it, so when it happened, I knew it was time to take a time-out and reflect (now I know it was a passive-aggressive tactic to punish a person who had elicited any of the aforementioned emotions in me. I'd ask to find faults in their logic and make them feel foolish or guilty. Whether they fell for it -to me, showing weakness- or confronted me -making me even more furious-, rage ensued).
* It made me conscious that even if in the moment it feels like you will never get over it unless you act out, it's not actually true (as long as you don't dwell on it on purpose when you feel yourself starting to let go, which is something I used to do to make sure that no one who wronged me left unpunished and to not admit I had overreacted).
* It changed my relationship with my negative or vulnerable emotions, from ""avoid/suppress at all costs"" to ""this is important information"".

I think it's important to state that the journal remained 100% private, even to my therapists. If not, I think I would have been hesitant to write about situations or drawing conclusions that painted me in a bad light. Ideally one should feel comfortable enough with their therapist to share everything, but reality is a different matter.

So that's it, basically. Learning to unpack the experience of anger as in, identify the emotions that led to it and learn to resolve them in non-aggressive ways (my to-go strategy nowadays is avoiding situations that cause them, which is not very healthy but it's better than being an abuser), detect the early signs and take time-outs to reflect before logic flies off the window, and realizing that I was causing long-lasting harm from temporary feelings.

Sometimes I require really long time-outs (at least 2-3 days) to calm down again. I often don't allow myself to talk to the other person during this time. Sometimes I tell myself that if I'm still mad after 3 days, I'll allow myself to lash out or punish the other party in some way so I can resist the temptation to do it in the moment, and fantasize about how I'd do it, but I don't. As with suicidal intent, the trick is to delay action until the emotion has receded. Other things I do during this cool down periods are:

* Write about it as I used to do in my journal. It usually helps me put my ideas in order before I talk to the other party about what happened (because the idea is not to put away the problem forever, but to deal with it when you're in the mood of doing it in a productive way).
* See people I'm not angry with. Socializing puts me in 'performing mode' and changes my mood easily.
* Listen to music that matches my mood, watch/read fragments from people/characters I identify with. Stuff like that. It calms me down a bit. I think it makes me feel understood or something.
* Distract myself with activities to let time pass ruminating as little as possible. Things that don't require mental effort (because I'm usually in no condition) such as going for a walk, watching TV, playing video games, etc.

Something I still struggle with to this day, is when people keep bugging me after I've made clear that I want to end the conversation. I rarely have any anger outbursts nowadays but when I do is usually because of this. So I kind of need people to cooperate with my problem. I think it's a good idea to tell your loved ones, while you're not angry (because when you are, you may find it tempting to word it in a way that is hurtful and punitive), that this happens to you and that you need them to respect your cool down period.

This is what has worked in my particular case of being someone with terrible emotional awareness (SPD+NPD) and extreme sensitivity to shame (NPD+AvPD).",27
36,The woman (his tenant/disciple) who my NPD ex kicked out of his house when I moved in tried to warn me about him but my anger and lack of empathy made me ignore her pain. Karma.,1,gycmss,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/gycmss/the_woman_his_tenantdisciple_who_my_npd_ex_kicked/,8,1591537420.0,"When I met my now ex boyfriend, he had a boyfriend-girlfriend couple living in his home. As a person with communal NPD (I think), they were one of the many people he benevolently counseled about their life problems. When I rebuffed his attempts to counsel me, rather than just be my empathetic boyfriend, he'd tell me I was missing out on his advice because he'd helped so many people with their problems and was ""really good at it."" 

In reflecting, I realize there were plenty of times when I'd acted the same -- thinking I had all the answers for other people's problems. I can still be this way, arrogant.

In any case, when I moved in with him, I looked forward to having another woman in the house. I figured we could become friends. But, a few days after I moved in, I asked her boyfriend if I could use one of his microphones and the girlfriend blew a total fit. She told me to stay away from her man and if I needed to talk to him, do it through her. This all culminated in my now ex telling the couple they had to move out. They were both angry at first but the boyfriend came around, realizing that for two years they'd paid incredibly low rent. But the woman stayed furious. At one point, my ex yelled at her in, what I thought then, was an uncharacteristic way.

As she prepared to leave, she glared at me and said of my ex, ""You watch. The same thing is going to happen to you. He's not who you think he is."" 

I thought she was just bitter and mentally unstable (I told a social worker how she behaved and he said it sounded like BPD). 

But 18 months later, her words ""He's not who you think he is"" came back to me. She was exactly right. She saw what I had been blind to when I was the idealized newbie and she was being discarded as one of his pet projects.

I realize how I had no empathy for her plight. I was just happy she was leaving because she was consistently mean to me after the blowup, sometimes overtly so, other times passive aggressively. But now I see that, even though she was that way, I could have cared about how it must have felt to be in her situation -- to have someone you thought was your friend throw you out with malice. On the one hand, her behavior was off the charts, on the other hand, I still could have cared about her. But I didn't really show her that I did. For instance, I could have said ""I'm sorry things turned out this way"" and really meant it. But, even though I prayed for her, in my heart, I felt she got what she deserved. 

Eighteen months later, the table turned.
I broke up with my ex because he didn't defend me when my daughter (24), who was living with us, hit me. She still lives in his house. He's temporarily living with the ex before me.

I couldn't understand how my daughter could be so callous towards me and pro my ex after he gaslighted me, traumatizing me. 

But now I see. She could care less about how he hurt me just like I didn't care about that other woman's feelings. After my ex discarded me, my daughter ignored me when I tried to warn her that he isn't who she thinks he is. In the same way, I ignored the warning I received about him by the woman he discarded before me. All I cared about was what benefited me -- having her gone. I'm sure that's exactly how my daughter felt when I left.

41,“Narcissistic abuse”,74,op0qce,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/op0qce/narcissistic_abuse/,72,1626906787.0,"Tl;dr narcissistic abuse is the same as abuse perpetrated by neurotypicals, and it’s use as a term is to demonize NPDs and allow neurotypicals to get away with being abusive themselves. 


I don’t even know why this term is so popular as though there’s some special type of abuse only narcissists have access to. Every article I’ve seen talking about “narc abuse” is just describing regular abuse, but apparently abuse is by default worse and “more valid” when perpetrated by a narcissist than a neurotypical. 

It really bothers me that pretty much every person I meet who has been a victim of abuse describes their abuser as a narcissist. It’s just statistically impossible when the percentage of abusers in the population is far higher than the percentage of people with NPD. Neurotypicals have just as high a capacity for cruelty as anyone with any mental illness. This cultural narrative of narcissists perpetrating the majority of abuse harms the NPD community, does nothing to actually help abuse victims besides giving them a false boogeyman, and serves no one except for neurotypical abusers who are allowed to keep their humanity and fly under the radar as all the anger and attention is deflected onto the “incurable and monstrous” predator NPD is caricatured as. 

“Narcissistic abuse” pins all the blame on narcissists as the sole perpetrators of abuse and lulls NTs into a false sense of security that they can avoid abuse simply by learning how to spot and avoid narcissists. It’s so neat and opportune how narcissists are “inherently dangerous, evil and incapable of change.” It takes the burden off of society to actually try and fix the issues that allow abuse to be so common and accepted when they can simply decide to demonize one group of people as “the problem” and then conveniently make that problem unsolvable by claiming that said group is inherently abusive, thus making abuse an external and unstoppable issues rather than the systemic issue it truly is. 

It reminds me of how rape used to be considered something that only happened in dark alleyways by evil, inhuman strangers thus letting the “good guys” who accounted for the majority of rape cases to get away with it. (Not trying to compare having NPD to being a rapist- it’s the dehumanization and deflection that I’m focusing on.) The idiocy of this herd mentality astounds me. People are so willing to trade the possibility of genuine change for the safety blanket of prejudice and cowardice.",74

* I was an abusive piece of shit as a teenager. I could not control my anger like at all. The ways that I talked to and treated my family were wayyyyyyy past the excusability line. 
* Yes I have matured a lot and have better self control, yes I feel ashamed, yes I feel bad for my parents sometimes, but no on the whole I don't feel bad, because I'm still angry. I still feel justified in some way. I'm terrified I don't have the self control or awareness to prevent repeating the behavior of my childhood. For when I was younger, I can make excuses and say ""Oh I was just a dumb teenager"" but as an adult there would be much more serious consequences. 

Grandiosity/vulnerability:

* Ok yeah, I secretly think I'm the shit. Over and over again I can impress people. I've always been smart, pretty and talented. 
* Yeah I hog conversations, talk about myself too much, don't care enough about what's happening in other people's lives. Put people down, get into unnecessary disagreements, get easily offended. It's not that I don't care at all it's that there's always something more interesting to focus on. I want to share my opinion more than I want to hear other people's. 
* I'm insecure af. I've also been bullied, excluded and abused over and over. Just as many people have thought I was weird as have been impressed by me. The result is I really want admiration and crave positive attention to make up for those times where I was hurt unfairly. More to prove to myself that I'm good then to anybody else. 

Ok, that was hard, but I feel a bit better. Maybe it will be easier next time. Maybe I'll actually be able to talk to my therapist about it. Self sabotage is fun /s",16

We (31 M & F) broke up 3 weeks ago and she’s blocked me everywhere.

I got mad at my ex a few weeks ago and was really mean when I yelled at her - this is when we broke up. I tried calling her a week later to ask if she wanted to go to a festival but she told me she was out of town. I texted her afterwards and she responded but it was short and polite. Then last week I called her because I had a panic attack and thought I was going to have to go the ER. She texted me later that day asking if I was okay and cracked a joke.

Anyways, when we had broken up before I started seeing this younger woman (22). It was very casual. Right before we broke up that same woman started following me on social media, liking my pictures, posted this old picture of my dog, and was snooping on my ex’s social media too. My ex brought this up to me and I got annoyed with her because I hadn’t talked that woman in a long time. Well after we broke up. Out of anger, I added this girl back on social media. A few days ago she flew out to stay with me and my ex found out and sent me a text saying, “enjoy your time with ___” and then blocked me on everything: my phone number, work phone, IG, FB, & even Venmo.


I should add, we broke up before and she blocked me on social media and then we eventually got back together. This is the first time she’s blocked my number though.

We were together for 3 years by the way. Anyways, she had called me a narcissist but I brushed it off. Now I’m wondering if she’s right. Anyone else with NPD act this way? If so, why??

Fastforward to today. I wrote to him last night asking to start over and just be friends. He said yes. I wrote ""yes, I would like to go back to how it was before"". No reply. So today I wrote to him again and we started talking and it turned out he wanted to go aaaall the way back to the beginning of our friendship where we barely talked and he said he didn't want to be close friends with me again. 

I lost it again and I should have just let it be but I just couldn't. He has blocked me everywhere and he doesn't want anything to do with me ever again. 

Has this happened to anyone else and how did you deal with it?

But shit happens and I split hard the other day. The unfortunate kind where everyone except for you are all bad. And I found myself dissociating before hand. I'm not sure how borderlines experience splitting but I imagine it's similar, and it got me thinking about some traits I have that make me wonder if I'm just BPD lmao here's some I was reflecting on

1. Splitting obviously. I know other people with NPD split but I'm not sure how that manifests. Spirals where I think everyone is lying and making fun of me and are awful people are the only times that I'm like ""oh yup that was splitting"". I'm sure I do it more often than I think though.
2. Dissociation. Every now and then I'll dissociate hard. I'm never sure if it's personality pathology or my ptsd though. (Even though the two are obviously linked so maybe the distinction isn't that important) Usually people just assume I'm drunk when this (or splitting) happens so I usually blame it on that or the PTSD since they're more likely to understand that than personality pathology. 
3. I hate the term, but ""favorite person"". By that I mean one person who you're extremely emotionally dependent on that people in the BPD subreddit talk about. For most of my life I didn't have that, I was just super dismissive of people's attempts to get close to me. But now I feel like that's changed. I have one friend who I talk to about my shit alot and she recently took a few days to herself (she has schizoaffective) and It's really impacted my emotional spiral. I despise that I'm that dependent on someone but oh well. 
4. Fear of abandonment. This one is super weird because I know I to some extent have this but it's mainly unconscious.  Like I will feel like someone abandoned or betrayed me and I'll always show anger and a dissmisiveness towards anyone implying I'm hurt by it, but afterwards unconscionably I always find myself drunk and crying. I usually don't even connect the two events. Maybe it's a fear of being unlovable who knows. 
5. Emotional liability. This one is also tough cause I'll go weeks or even months being basically numb to everything, then one little thing happens and I start self destructing and a whole spiral happens. During that my emotions and self esteem are all over the place. It's really overwhelming.

There's probably more than just those but that's all that come to mind right now. Obviously BPD and NPD are closely linked but I struggle to even see the difference sometimes lol Anyone have any thoughts on this?",14

Then, after it passes, I massively regret it.
For example, yesterday was my birthday. I have no money and few hobbies, so I couldn't think of anything I wanted to do when my fiance asked. Since I had no ideas, he decided that in the morning we would take his little brother fishing, then mayne do something else. I was secretly hoping that when the morning came, he would decide he didn't want to go fishing, and would rather stay home, but I couldn't tell him that because he had already made all the preparations and I didn't want him to be upset at me. Morning came, I went with them, and I was angry and nasty the whole time because he didn't read my mind and realize I wanted us all to stay home and cancel the trip. After we got home, I wanted his brother to go home, but there was nobody home to watch him so he had to stay with us, so I got mad again and hid in the bedroom watching tv by myself.
During these episodes of anger, I felt that I was totally rational and had been wronged. After they passed (the next morning) I realized that I had just been upset for no reason and had not only made everyone else miserable, but I had completely destroyed my own birthday.

50,I hate my mother,10,prdqxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/prdqxv/i_hate_my_mother/,8,1632076876.0,"Hey,   


I’m 17 F and undiagnosed. This is just me venting but there’s a question I have for you as well. If you don’t feel like reading this far too long rant, I suggest you scroll down to the end lmao.  
   
The relationship between me and my mom is really unstable and I've overthought it so many times that I've become entirely clueless about what's happening.  
   
First some context. My mom is a very worried person, and a huge control freak.  
 To make sure everything lives up to her idea of ‘the right thing to do’, she wants to manage everything, including other people’s lives. On surface level, she just seems like a very caring and invested person, and she is. She wants nothing else for me than to be okay, but she’s never given me the room to experiment with life myself and I feel completely incompetent as a result. I never learnt to make decisions or think about what I want. I never learnt to deal with setbacks. I’ve never had to feel the consequences of my actions, because she’s always been there to save my ass. She has never taught me to do any chores around the house whatsoever, and now she complains that I don’t feel a responsibility to do chores; often accusing me of being lazy and taking everything for granted. Every interaction I have with her these days seems to end up as either a power struggle or an annoyingly long lecture where she says the same things she always says, yet nothing ever changes. Either of us corrects the other, who gets offended and passive aggressive. The situation escalates, she starts yelling at me, I ignore her, later she comes up to apologize. I've won, but at what cost? Every week again. It is honestly suffocating.  
   
See, I AM fucking lazy. I am an entitled and selfish asshole, I guess. I don’t clean my room when she’s been telling me to do it for weeks. I don’t study for tests whatsoever. I am late for school all the time, I have ghosted more people than I can count on my fingers and I forget appointments and birthdays. Part of this might be because of my ADHD but it’s also because I just couldn’t care less and feel like the rules don't apply to me. Now, I know I do all this, but God forbid that SHE calls me out on it. And the thing that’s weird to me is that I never get that angry when other people tell me to get my shit together, just her. My dad doesn’t really care about what I get up to, or at least isn't constantly in my face about what and how I should do better (which ironically leads to me being more responsible). With other people, I either convince myself that they're unimportant and I don't have to care about what they think, or I don’t get angry at them, but ashamed because I feel inferior to them.  
   
She makes me angry like nothing else can. I can feel it in my entire body, I get tense, irrational and feel like I could explode. Like I could lose control any moment and start yelling at her, cursing her out with the ugliest words I can think of and smashing stuff around the house. But I never explode. Instead I put on the most emotionally flat face I can manage, ignoring whatever she says until she leaves me alone, which of course makes her even more annoyed. She has asked me if she's doing something wrong and told me that she feels nothing she does is ever good enough for me and... I won't let it affect me, but deep down there's this sting of guilt. It bothers her that I can't be open with her. I’d even say it hurts her. But I feel physically unable to get the words out. I feel physically unable to get vulnerable and apologize to her, or ask her for support. And it has not always been like this. In fact, there was a time where I was extremely clingy with my mom. My parents separated when I was 7 and I saw her 5 days a week but would still cry every night I didn’t see her. But today, her entire… being… triggers the shit out of me and I’m just not entirely sure why.   
   
So alright, I guess that was just me venting. But there’s another reason I made this post. I am curious about how you guys experience anger. Do you experience it around certain people or situations? Do you get angry a lot, or maybe not at all? What happens when you do get angry? Please feel free to share anything you think is relevant or want to get off your chest in general.  
 

Thanks in advance,

So I'm sorry if your comments offend me and I lash out, I really don't mean to hurt you I just don't wanna be hurt myself. 

So on that note, my actions are really incontrollable when I'm hurt, as you can see. As soon as somebody says something to imply that I'm not perfect I feel a fire burning inside me. I get extremely defensive and will say anything to get them to take it back. 

Jealousy is one of the most frequent emotions I feel. As soon as someone is doing better than me, whether that's more friends, more money, a job that I want, going somewhere that I want to go without me, it really doesn't matter I just fill with jealousy and will start trying to make that person's life miserable so I can feel better about mine. 

If someone tries to say I'm wrong, man I will argue forever and if that person blocks me and I can't continue it physically hurts. I have so much anger and rage and no where to send it that I don't know what to do with myself. 

So yeah I'm an asshole, I know I'm an asshole so I really don't need people to give me more shit for my behaviour I'm looking for advice only. I just feel like all of my asshole behaviours could be managed a lot better if I had better control of my emotions. I just have no idea how to control them. I've tried counteracting them with my thoughts but I don't listen to the thoughts I just listen to the feelings and then my thoughts start trying to justify my feelings.",15

I has anger issues before but I managed to keep those feelings on the inside and rarely expressed them after the age of 18 but now they're worse than ever.

I feel at least slightly angry as a baseline for my emotions on a day to day basis and even the littlest things can set me off now. It started with much more frequent and more violent fantasies of hurting whoever upset me and often ends in killing that person either by choking them or stomping on their skull until nothing's left of it and while i hope to know that I could bever do it in real life, these fantasies are so cathartic to me  even though it's objectively messed up and I know I need to talk to someone about this but haven't had the chance. I also feel nervous about sharing this information because I don't want to get in trouble for this, there's also the worry about how I'll be judged by whoever I tell (in part because looking at me from the outside no one could guess that I'm this angry inside).

The fantasies aside It's also much harder to control my actions when I'm angry. Not getting what I want when I was sure I'd get it resulted in damaging some property pretty badly and the police got called on me. I've never had trouble with law enforcement before so I didn't get charged with vandalism but if anything similar happens again I'd get in trouble and I don't want that even though it felt good kicking the shit out of this object until it broke (not specifying because I don't wanna be identified through that)

Thing is I know that in that case I was frustrated because I was stressed and feeling disappointed and maybe even hurt, but it still came out as anger. Then again, I know that even if I managed to express these original feelings it wouldn't help anyway so that fuels the rage even more! I think 'they're against me anyway, they don't want to listen or help' and past experiences actually helped solidify those thoughts...

In the end though I don't want to have all this anger and emotional decadence. I don't want things to slowly build up like and then rapidly be let out like some sort of inner helter skelter.
But what can I even do about it? It feels like it's out of my control at this point and  I feel helpless",4

I don't really recognize the feelings inside me, they're more like a background noise. Sometimes I can't even tell if they're good or bad.

This leads to rage outbursts and depressive episodes, even if I numb them off they're probably bottling up.  I can't be productive if I fall into introspection, if I let myself feel, so I just put everything aside. I don't want to perceive my non-existent self-worth, I don't want to perceive anything unpleasant. I want to be disconnected, and so I did.

(fyi im planning to go to therapy, and ive been doing some research about the disorder)(well its impossible for me to look into articles cause of demonization of the mental disorder.)

So for context:

It has been manifesting since the beginning of 2021? I've been a little bit disorderly, obsessive and compulsive. The fake fantasies in my head has been playing and playing.

My ego has also been inflating, like alot. Like it's unhealthy self love and obsession. I'd range from being like ""I'm god! I AM TRULY GOD. I AM GOD, everyone loves  me, I will play out this obsession will throw the people who have wronged me under the bus and they will cry and beg for a million apologies, while I stare at them angry and disillusioned at them, and I will be reborn new again"" while holding back my tears. Or my switch will be flipped and I will straight up feel suicidal, and play up a million scenarios where#I want to straight up commit suicide or feel like shallow, and nobody's going to help me.)

I didn't have a outright violent childhood, it was somewhat normal, but it's toxic.  My dad isn't that sympathetic towards me, neither my mom if I experience some sort of distress, and don't know what to do with my suicidal behaviours.  Sometimes my dad would treat me like garbage and hurt me with his casual ""do you need to go to the mental hospital vibes"" the place I'm in is toxic and somewhat distressful. I just relived a memory where he assaulted me and just yelled at me a year ago, while I was crying, and it was so painful for me that I had to block the memories. And they just take it as me  being manipulative, which i dont want to vent about my problems to a bunch of strangers, but i didnt have that much support in my years. Also i got backstabbed and stomped upon, so thats even worse

last but not least, im starting to be angry and resentful like my dad. he has alot of temper issues, anger issues (i think) and he is often scary when he gets really angry, which means i dont feel this safe in my home/. which manifests my unhealthy clinging problems towards others and the need to vent and the massive adoration to feel this loved and in constant euphoria is getting to my head. maybe my love is manifesting toxic, maybe im not this good at loving even now, and i just want the pain to stop.

what should i really do..........? tell me?",8

It's not what I wanted. I wanted respect, but it seems like she's only calmed down out of fear instead of actual respect. I feel like I'm slowly becoming my mother. The passive aggression, temper tantrums, random outbursts, not being direct when I feel frustrated and then being angry when I'm not understood or being listened to. I actually feel like a huge bitch and I don't want to exist anymore. I can't handle problems the right way. The way I always hoped I could. No matter how hard I try my anger gets the best of me and I react inappropriately. Then I have to look like a fool and apologize after realizing it was inappropriate. Sometimes I don't even apologize when I fear it'll just happen again and then I'll let someone else down. I've changed so much these past years and my progress feels like little to none.

I wrote two posts in here about feeling amoral and getting almost sociopathic thoughts 6 months into therapy. Long story short, I got a surprising high score on psychopathy test recently and my therapist suggested that it's because I'm experiencing a push back from opening up to vulnerability.

I am so threatened by my capacity to be vulnerable in relationships with people that I subconsciously convinced myself I'm a cold-hearted, detached sociopath cosplaying a functioning member of society. Everything to have a reason NOT to be vulnerable.

This never happens, because I know even if my brains telling me is right, it's actually  wrong. I don't want to hurt anyone, so I deal with  confrontations like any other person would the best I can. I fear that these reactions leak out without me realizing though since i still do get in trouble surrounding those types of things and I don't even notice I said something like that until its brought up. and I wish it didn't happen at all, or at the very least ended after a minute. It goes on forever and I may never be over it. Same with when I'm comfronting someone about an Issue i have with what they did to me, I immediately want to bombard them with  shoving my own insecurities and claims into their mouth   and get pissed at them for thinking they're better than me, but again I know it's wrong and so i restrain myself, and in some shitty sense it kinda sucks having to stop doing something when you genuinely think its right.

Maybe I don't show it but inside I hate people, I hate how much they lack self awareness, how they don't recognize their mistakes, how dumb they are, how they judge everyone.

And yes I feel that I'm better than them but at the same time I hate myself for that. Because no matter my feelings inside, I'm nice, I always try to be respectful and I can't understand why others can't be.

I ditch myself everyday because I think that I'm narcissist and that for that I must feel guilty. That be a npd makes me monster and I'm the wrong one, I'm sick and I need fixing.

But then I see all these assh*les around me feeling proud about things that they don't even have, feeling that they are smart, beautiful, successful when they are just garbages who happens to lack any sense of empathy and being lucky in their lives while I always try tyo humble myself to the point that I invalidate me completely. I torture myself by overthinking my feelings and try to control me because I'm scared of being bad person while others are just ruthless and take advantage of everyone. I'm not good person but at least I know that I didn't use anyone ever.

I feel so angry because I see so many people on this sub blaming theirselves for their actions and maybe indeed they did something bad I don't really know but nobody recognizes the fact of how so many others have good time because they never feel remorse.

I'm confused if they are narcissists or sociopaths or just d*cks who only care about theirselves what I know is that self awareness and self improvement is a bunch of bullshits. I wish I could be like them use people and believe all the time that I'm the greatest of all not punishing me for feeling that I'm better in things that are obvious. I wish I could be delusional and believe that I never hurt anyone or im the prettiest girl in the world or I'm capable for things I'm clearly not.

And no it's not confidence to not care at all about what people say about you. Yes it's not healthy to depend your life on others people's opinions but to not care about what others say to you it's not good. It's not healthy to just only focus on you completely and forget others. We live in a society and it's logical to see what others do or to worry if they are better from you. I don't understand why things like ""I'm this, person and I don't change"" ""I don't care what others say"" considered healthy but if you are envious and jealous, or people annoy you you are the wrong one. Both approaches are wrong.

I'm tired treating myself bad because I msfe the mistake to believe that I have actually better traits and more depth than others. I'm tired hold my critisism and be judgmental inside me when others give they unsolicited opinions for everyone openly. Whatever I'm, I'm a person and I deserve to have a good life. I never hurt anyone intensionally, I never use anyone and I never told lies. Just because my thoughts are mean diesbt mean that I'm a bad person. And yes I have the right to be proud of myself for all those thinks and not be afraid that I will offend someone with my position. 

I'm sure that someone will come and tell me that it's like I think I deserve more than someone who is actually manipulative. You know what? I'm tired always take in consideration what the other side would think. I would never tell to someone that I deserve something more but I can't be afraid all the time to be proud of myself. Yes I want to feel proud for being a good person or I'm prude or I never cheat etc. I'm tired humble me down all the time. I hate myself for always have this voice in my head that saying but think about the other side, you lay offebs them. Nobody ever take into consideration my side so why should I continue do that? To be a descend person? 

Probably you will judge me for my statements a d probably they confirm that I'm a narcissist. But I don't care anymore I'm so done with life in general. Maybe people here online are more self aware but in real life things are different. It makes me mad seeing all these people in every mental sub suffer amdcstruuggje and feeling bad for even thinking that they may be narcissists or bad people just because they feel envy or something. And I'm mad with all these therapists who try to fix you and make you feel like the wrong one. Nobody in my opinion who is aware of his mistakes and feel bad about them and wants to change is the actual problem. The problem is all these monsters around us who bieve that they are the best and having the best time because they never did some self critisism while others like me we blame ourselves to the point of neglect. 

It's a very tupical npd thinking what I do right now by blaming the world end not me for my thoughts? It may seem this way but if it was actually true I wouldn't be here, wasting my time by hating me, I wouldn't want to die, i would be out there brag about how great I'm without caring if others agree with me. Sooner or later my gradiosity episode will end and I will return to my shameful state of mind of feeling like I'm the worst person and I don't have the right to believe that I'm better or different from others around me even if it is obvious.",14

I’m not in therapy or anything but I’m in the process of finding a therapist. I know obviously I won’t know until I see a therapist but I’m curious what other people think. These are the following symptoms I’ve experienced that I can think of at the moment:

- I’m very selfish and focus on myself and how I look or are perceived yet I also hate myself and think I’m disgusting, I’m also disgusted by my behavior but I can’t control how I feel in certain situations 

- extremely displaced anger, I also have difficulty taking no for an answer 

- I get obsessions with romantic partners, non-stop talk about them, get upset when they leave, I know that’s a bpd trait 

- I push people away because I feel bad for how I act 

- I feel like I deserve the bad things that come to me 

- I try to make myself look smarter than I am but I’m actually really dumb

- I’m overly sexual, which I know is an hpd trait

- manipulative and want things out of people

- black and white thinking

- very erratic and impulsive also have emotions that are all over the place

- sometimes have to mask how I feel

- this probably goes with displaced anger but I hate everybody and I’m angry with everything, at least recently, but I’ve also been very stressed out 

- I should mention I do have extreme ocd and I also disassociate but I don’t feel as if those fully affect why I act the way I do. I also have a parent clinically diagnosed with npd that didn’t seek treatment. (Granted diagnosis was from a sibling but she has her doctorate in psychology)

- I want to fall in love with somebody so bad but I don’t feel as if I could treat my partner correctly. When my last partner wouldn’t contact me I’d freak out and also gaslight them. I didn’t notice my behavior until later on. 

- I’m shy and I hate the spotlight but my brain tells me I want attention from everybody, it’s weird 

- I talk bad behind peoples backs/gossip 

- upset when I don’t get what I want 

- easily hurt and offended. Difficult receiving criticism 

- compulsive lying 

- difficulty admitting fault but overly apologetic 

- self harm occasionally 

- I know this is wrong but I’m critical of other people internally. Like in my head my brain goes oh this person is embarrassing I don’t want to be seen with them etc. including romantic partners. 

- I just don’t feel like I fit in with people generally

- I have suicide bated before, specifically with my mother. I didn’t in the moment see it as suicide baiting. I would just sort of do it out of anger. I would honestly hurt her feelings a lot and I didn’t care. Until I really noticed what I was doing. I don’t know if it’s my possibly npd or disassociating from my feelings or a mixture of both. But I know myself enough that I wouldn’t want to admit to it being npd so. 

I overlap with a lot of cluster b traits, I know for sure I don’t have ASPD though because I feel a LOT of guilt, mainly from my ocd. 

It’s also difficult to admit that I think I have npd, I know that’s a trait as well. It sucks because I want to be a good person and I want to change I just don’t know how and it’s difficult.

It’s weird… I see you all tearing each other apart trying to establish that you are better, smarter, more beautiful, or whatever trait gets you the most attention and I get it. 

Here’s the thing, I’m not sure I can relate to most people. But when I see you dismiss others, minimize their achievements, status, or just plain tell them they’re wrong, and brag, I can relate to that. 

Someone else here said they felt anger if someone found joy in something they didn’t. I hate game of thrones and I get so irritated when others enjoy it. It’s almost like how can they pay attention to a show that’s so obviously uncreative and boring? The only interesting / funny scenes to me were the torture scenes and some of the eye candy. (But I don’t think I have ASPD, the scenes were just interesting).

I have another problem though, when I hurt people, it’s usually pretty indirect. At times I didn’t even realize I was hurting people, I thought I was just righting perceived wrongs and making a point.

And with that self-awareness, I think I’ve been trying to be good and not be retributive. I also have an auditory processing disorder - I can hear perfectly, but if there’s a lot of noise, I have trouble understanding people, so I usually tune them out. But I also just don’t care very much and it’s exhausting to nod and smile and help people feel validated. Maybe it’s not so much that I don’t care but that my primary motivation is getting attention.

The kind of situation in which someone who just happens to be a tiny bit luckier gets a promotion?...or someone from a slightly poorer nation gets access to a visa waiver whereas you don't,in spite of being richer? And reacted violently to that?
 But that's not even the real rage. The wrath comes when I iterate this utter injustice and someone gets angry at ME for pointing it out. I told someone it's fucking retarded and he got mad at me and insulted me or told me something like ""it's your fault"" or whatever. That very moment I nearly exploded. I wanted to punch headbutt him,then lunch him again and again and again untiI broke MY bones and could no longer clench my fists. Then grab a stone off the road and smash his head with it or bite off his face while looking into his eyes as I scratch his face with my fingers until I tear off all the fat in his cheeks only for me to rip off his tongue out of his mouth or his eyes. Words can't describe how angry that made me feel. It was like a neverending outburst of fury got into my whole body,it was so intense my left foot kept shivering  from the knee down. Could barely control myself and as I get older (I'm 20) controlling it gets more difficult. I want to do it and look at his shitty face as I do it then whisper that it's his fault into his ear.

i say this because i figured out that i’ve been putting in a facade for years that i’m this sweet, lovely, harmless person when my actions say the opposite. i’ve been problematic for quite some time. albeit, i was abused by my narcissistic boyfriend for 5 years (i treated him badly in return over time), and i’m still being abused by my mom who is also a narcissist. 

i find myself acting like my mom because she’s displayed her toxic behaviors to me since i was very young and still does. i learned all of my toxic behaviors from her. she used to gloat about being able to manipulate people and i thought it was an advantage she had. when in reality, it’s not. her and my ex have pushed my buttons in more ways than one so i started acting like them in return when i was hurt. i mirrored their actions. it also started happening even when i wasn’t appeared to be hurt. i’d act this way if i was just trying to get my way. 

a lot of the time i feel like the world should revolve around me, and when it’s not i become depressed. when the attention is on someone else i get jealous. it makes me wonder if i’m really good enough, and when i get into depressed moods like this it’s followed by anger. because feeling pain always made me feel weak. i want to be powerful. 

i’ve lost a lot of people in my life, and i’m beginning to believe it was truly my fault. i’ve victimized myself a lot, and i’m tired of pretending i’m a victim. the truth is, i stopped being a victim the moment i acted like my abusers. i have wronged many people. many people have also wronged me. it’s a vicious cycle. i turn into a nasty, nasty person when i’m angry or hurt. i say despicable things.

An investigation of forgiveness related to NPD.
Do you ever split a person back in white, when you have that person ""locked inside the black box"" ?

Please, be honest and think before answering. Just because you still hangs out with that person that you´ve split in black, doesn´t mean you have forgiven the person. You could still be ""friend"" with a person but at the same time have anger/hateful feelings towards him/her.

I’ve always thought I was just a depressed borderline but since about two years ago, I feel like I stopped relating to it at all. It was like there was a dial inside me slowly amping up my narcissistic traits, which became even more amplified being around others with NPD and being complimented like ten times a day by a variety of people. Like I rarely feel insecure or that intense fear of being abandoned anymore tbh, and if anything, I feel like I’ve become the toxic narc I once feared; e.g. bullying/name calling, treating people like discardable objects, contemptuous behavior, etc. Also, how to know if this is not just narcissistic traits I may have adopted and actually a whole personality disorder.

- Mistake 
- Defensiveness (Insisting I'm right, instinctively and involuntarily lying to cover up my failure) 
- Suffering (Loss, criticism/hate from others etc.)
- Shame, Fear, Frustration 
- Counter-productive Coping (Avoiding the person/situation/topic, forgetting information/the entire incident, blanking out and ignoring problems even with obvious physical evidence)
- Return to mistake 

I hate this. I'm stuck in this cycle and it's ruining my life, it destroys my ability to learn and grow (I repeat mistakes for decades), makes me ruin everything I touch (Furniture damaged from neglect, room reeking of week-old laundry, journals reeking from sweat and tears etc.) and worst of all, inconveniences and pisses off everybody I get too close to (Undone chores/tasks, insane forgetfulness, constant instinctive arrogance that I'm blind to unless it's pointed out which is obviously disgusting and irritating for everyone who notices).

I feel like my brain is actually somehow decaying from this. I do the cycle above, anger someone and subsequently break down in depressive and frustrated crying raging fits basically every night. If not physically then somewhat internally mentally. 

It's gotten worse over the years. As I slog on I forget more, I lie more and I'm arrogant more all without realizing because my stupid brain actually seems to think forgetting and being less aware of my flaws is a great survival strategy. 

It seems my brain has nothing but BLINDLY AGREE/FIGHT/CONDESCEND/PLAY VICTIM/ERASE MEMORY ACT DUMB/DUMB SILENCE mode. It's like these are the only options it chooses from, and I won't realize until it's too late and I've said something that everyone finds atrocious.

At the time, I didn't know that those were symptoms of my NPD. I was officially diagnosed with NPD in March 2020, but it's likely that I suffered from it most of my life. 

Recently, my therapist told me that I no longer fit the criteria of someone with a personality disorder. I have requested a few tests to confirm this news. Regardless, I have made significant progress since I first started therapy and I wanted to share my growth with everyone. 

**Note: this is not therapeutic/clinical advice. This is just my personal experience and what has personally helped me.** 

Now, straight to it.

&#x200B;

**Pre-NPD diagnosis**

***Suicidal Ideation, Control, Anxiety***  
The first order of business was dealing with my suicidal ideation. After many conversations with my therapist and introspection, I learned that it was a coping mechanism. I was trying to control my anxiety with the comfort of knowing that I have 'a way out'. It was also exacerbated with black-and-white thinking that always resulted in extreme choices (i.e. suicide). So if I wanted to take a risk that would cause me anxiety, I would think ""Whatever, I could always just kill myself"". This would make me feel calmer, but it would repress my anxiety instead of dealing with it. It was a final act of rebellion that no one could take from me. This need for control also manifested in different ways. For example, I would feel like I had to do everything myself. I wouldn't trust anyone with important information, jobs, chores, etc. I would also always act invulnerable and unbreakable to keep my emotions in control.

I had to let go of this need for control. I started this by being more vulnerable to the trustworthy people in my life. It was so difficult. I felt weak, ashamed, and powerless every time I honestly opened up to someone. I would even be thinking of those conversations days later and regretting every word. I would imagine them thinking less of me, feeling embarrassed for me, or even making fun of me. But I knew I had to do it. This was for me, after all. Slowly, those feelings began to fade. I started to feel more confident about my emotions, and my relationships with my friends and family started to get better. I noticed that they started to open up to me too. It felt like by opening up to them, I gave them the green light to do the same. It felt good to have someone that trusts me with this kind of stuff.

&#x200B;

**Post-NPD diagnosis**

***Denial, Dishonesty, Self-Image***  
This happened at the start of the pandemic, which was very convenient for me. I had so much free time to work on myself, and I was forced to be alone with my thoughts much of the time. After asking them multiple times, my therapist finally diagnosed me with NPD. It felt like a death sentence. I couldn't believe it. I kept thinking of all the times where I thought I displayed empathy. ""What about that one time I comforted a crying stranger in the street"", or ""How come I felt sad when my cat was hurt?"", or ""Why do I feel bad when I see a disabled person?"". Of course, this was all conditional empathy. But, I am a scientist, and I had to get this information from a source that I can 100% trust. So, I went on Google's scholarly articles section and searched articles on NPD.

After much reading, I realized that the NPD diagnosis did fit my profile. As much as I wanted to pretend I wasn't Narcissistic, I knew I shouldn't fall into the trap of denial that some of the case studies referenced. I cried a lot that night. The next day, I swore that I would be as honest as possible with myself, and with my therapist, no matter how shaming the truth is. I didn't mind lying to everyone else, though. I just saw no point in being dishonest with myself and with someone that I'm paying to help me.

So, during my next session, I told my therapist every single emotion I felt since our last interaction. It was horrifying. I felt the image I built over my entire life crumble to pieces. All the lies I told my therapist were now obvious. I was ashamed of how weak I sounded. I was worried of what they might be thinking of me. I wanted to break down and cry after every sentence. Despite that, I related all my experiences so my therapist can help me in the best way possible. I then managed a genuine apology for how I treated them the past year. I can't begin to tell you how difficult that apology was. It felt like my chest was tightening after every word. I later learned that this sensation was just a tiny reflection of the overwhelming guilt I felt for everything else I've done in my life. 

I learned an important lesson during that session: I should always be honest with myself. Otherwise, I risk building up a fake self-image that will become tougher to shatter as I progress in life. Better to rip the bandage now.

So, I started keeping a private journal where I could be completely honest with my thoughts and feelings. I paid particular attention to some of the doubtful things I did throughout the day. Example: *Did I just try to manipulate that person when I said that irrelevant fact? Why did I exaggerate about my accomplishment to my friend just now? Am I purposefully trying to make my mom upset by ignoring her?* I would then have an honest discussion about those thoughts with my therapist. Session after session, I challenged myself to be more vulnerable with my therapist. This lead me to realize that they didn't care that I had a 'dark side'. They just wanted to help. They were happy to feel trusted and they were glad I was utilizing their hard-earned skillset and knowledge. I also found myself caring less about what they thought of me. Not in an arrogant sort of way. Rather, it was in an unconcerned sort of way. It felt good. I started to understand that most people don't think of my flaws as much as I think of them.  


***Guilt, Victim Mentality***  
With this newfound awareness came a price. The more aware I became of my actions, the guiltier I felt. I would feel so guilty from all the times I've manipulated people, even unintentionally. I felt guilty about my streak of lies and broken promises. I felt particularly guilty about how exploitative I was of my family. I remember recklessly spending my money and then making up reasons and excuses so my family would send me more money than I needed. And they did. Not because they're doormats, but because I constantly victimized myself and I knew how to manipulate their emotions and their love for me.

While I was glad for the guilt (because it proved that I knew what was right from wrong), it was still very difficult to deal with during my treatment. I believe this was because it compounded with my insecurity and victim mentality. It's like the guiltier I felt, the more insecure I became of my actions and choices, and the worse my victim mentality got. Which then made me feel guiltier because I felt like a burden to everyone around me. Which then made me feel more insecure as I would continue to view myself as an evil monster, which then... you get the picture. It was a vicious cycle that kept getting worse until my therapist very directly told me that I was victimizing myself during one of our sessions. I wanted to argue. I really felt like it doesn't apply to me. I felt my anger rise up at the accusation. But, I knew I had distorted thinking from my NPD, and my therapist is just likely to be more objective than I am.

So, I did some searching on people with victim mentalities. I found that I fit the profile of negative self-talk, self-sabotage, overthinking, making excuses to avoid responsibility, resentment, etc. It was a lot. I felt overwhelmed. This was a whole new thing that I had to deal with on top of my NPD. I started to feel hopeless as I focused on how long it would take me to get my life back on track. I then felt angry at my parents. Angry that they contributed to my past trauma and that they likely caused me permanent psychological damage. This went on for days. Then, as I was self-reflecting, I realized how I was falling into the trap the symptoms described. I realized that I was actively victimizing myself, even in describing the root cause of my victimization. So, I began to tackle those symptoms by using brute force.

One by one, I would google the symptoms and read about scientifically-approved therapeutic approaches. For example, practicing mindfulness was a big one in dealing with overthinking. So, whenever I found myself overthinking about something, I would immediately shift my focus towards what I'm doing at the moment. Am I cleaning the house and I started to think of that one time I was caught in a lie? Then I better focus on reaching every nook and cranny. Am I at work inputting data and I just remembered a particularly humiliating rejection? Then I better focus on finding any trends or deviations in this dataset. I became good at this. My worry and general anxiety subsided significantly. I also became more focused on the work that I'm currently doing over fantasies that may or may never happen. Even my manager noticed this, and has started teaching me new skills and giving me better projects. It felt great to be valued at work.

I just kept making my way down through the list of symptoms while trying to be objective. The most difficult symptom to tackle was resentment. Mainly because getting over resentment requires forgiveness which, in turn, requires acceptance. I was bad at that. Very bad. But, I had practiced relinquishing control over my anxiety when I was trying to deal with my suicidal behavior. Logically speaking, if I can accept anxiety, then I should be able to accept other negative emotions. With this mindset, I first set to work by learning more about those emotions.

Guilt, for example, is a negative emotion with an important purpose. Guilt tells me when I've done something wrong, and when there's a lesson to learn from it. Thus, if I'm feeling guilty, it must be because there's a lesson that I need to learn. This realization allowed me to discard 'useless guilt', which is guilt over things that weren't my fault. For example, my guilt over my previous trauma. I was a child when it happened. What's the lesson to learn from this feeling of guilt here? That I shouldn't trust my own parents as a child? That's nonsense. I would never expect this of another child and I shouldn't expect it of myself. Thus, I shouldn't feel guilty about this.

I then started to calibrate my guilt. I used a technique where I would close my eyes, project an emotion in front of my imagination, and visualize it. I would determine the emotion's color, shape, and size. Guilt was always purple irregular blob for me. The worse my guilt would get, the bigger and more irregular this purple blob would be. I would then relive previous memories that are causing me guilt, and try to recalibrate and determine their importance. For example, is there any point to feeling massive amounts of guilt for that one time I stole a Snickers bar from a grocery store 10 years ago? No, I've already learned my lesson. Thus, the guilt from this memory is overinflated.

  
**Insecurity, Need for Attention**  
I then started practicing the acceptance technique with all my negative emotions. Whether it was anger, sadness, jealousy, shame, etc. The irrelevant regrets from previous years started to matter less. I also noticed that it became harder for me to feel overwhelmed by those emotions. As in, I no longer had the urge to punch walls whenever I got angry. Instead, I would let myself feel the anger, honestly reflect on why I feel that way, and then calibrate as necessary.

This newfound acceptance was also key in practicing self-advocacy and getting over my insecurities. For example, I was very cowardly. My dad was very concerned with self-image and he always shamed me for making mistakes. I was also always expected to shut up, take my punishment, and move on. Any attempt to argue would lead to more abuse. This made me terrified of standing up for myself over the years. Deep down, I always knew I was a coward. But, I also knew that I didn't want to be a coward. To solve this problem, I had to start by accepting the shame of being terrified all the time.

Once I identified my insecurities and the feelings associated with them, I had to find a way to work on them without messing up my current relationships. I remember thinking *""Man, I wish I had someone who understood me that could give me advice"".* I then realized that this was a role I had to fill for myself. So, I used a technique wherein I started to think of myself in the 3rd person. I would pretend that I'm just another friend who needs genuine advice. I would then try to objectively consider the situation, think about a rational solution, and then follow through with my own advice.

Essentially, I became my own personal hero. Basically guiding myself and nudging myself along whenever I reach a roadblock. I would push myself further every time to do necessary things that would usually scare me. At first, it was little things like voicing my opinion whenever I disagreed with someone. Then, it became saying no to my controlling roommate whenever he had an unreasonable demand. Then, it became standing up for myself whenever I'm insulted. This was especially challenging because I also had to be rational, fair, and polite while self-advocating. But, one incident at a time, I saw my confidence grow to new heights.

This confidence boost was important in dealing with my neediness. I started to notice I no longer cared for an external supply. That I was my own supply, in a way. I didn't need someone else's attention to feel good about myself. I had myself to do that. I was confident in my ability to guide myself, and in my vision of who I wanted to be. And, since I accepted myself and my feelings, I no longer cared as much about what other people thought of me. Getting attention from someone else seems like a step-down at this point.

TLDR: A ton of self-reflection and therapy helped me in overcoming my NPD.",404

Or do I not allow myself to feel as strongly towards others where this behaviour can come out.

78,Getting treatmeant for Narcissism,13,nx9icy,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/nx9icy/getting_treatmeant_for_narcissism/,11,1623394152.0,"Which kind of therapy, is there a way to talk about Narcissitic/NPD traits to a therapist without ending up getting diagnosed, any there any self-help sources? (When i try to look up help its all only for people around the narcissist and not for the narcissitic person)? 
My main problems are:

I dont really care if i hurt other people unless i have chosen that person as my equal/an extension of me then i really care

I do think its fun to make people upset/angry/sad but only if i dont like them/are neutral about them. I especially want them to hurt if they did something harmfull to me or one of the people i care about (mainly because thats an attack on me aswell)

I dont feel like i have a real personality, i only have an intense need for validation, praise, love and recognition

When someone annoys me i want to hurt them, i usually do this by changing my tone to make it clear that I dont like them, i usually want to do violent stuff aswell but i can hold myself back

I lie a lot, and its very hard for me to stop even when i try

As soon as a person (even one i did care about) is out if my life/is not really any use for me. I completely stop caring, cut the connection and find someone else

I get extremely depressed, like actively considering to kms, when i dont have people around me to think i am great, it only takes 3 days without people actively admirering me before i get to this state

I believe i dersevere better than other people and that i am better, this leads to a lot of disappointment and anger when people around me dont recognize it.

I try to manipulate sometimes, but I am bad with social cues and often fail and just anger people or upset them

When i dont want people to be upset or anger them or hurt them i often acidentally do

I get extremely jealous of others, especially if they are getting recognition for something i should be getting it for instead. I get very angry with the person who got the recognition instead of me.

I will choose an authority figure who i believe is superior in some way and really try and make them like me, I will plan stuff around making them notice me and think i am special. When i realize they are just a person who isnt special i completely loose interest

I feel like i am the most worthless horrible person in the world, i feel like i am just like my dad who violently (emotionally and physically) abused me because he had similar traits

I dont really feel any emotions exept rage and anger or intense emptyness or sometimes satisfaction when i get recogntion.

I feel no remorse when i do something to hurt other people that didnt hurt me, sometimes (often) i even find it kind of funny

When people get upset with me or are upset around me i usually dont feel bad and i dont know how to react to them or make them okay, my go to is just kind of laughing ackwardly, or i will go full empath mode, exept i dont care about them i just pretend i really do, when i do that i feel better about myself for being a good person and i will think about it for a long time and make it a really big deal i did that for them. I dont expect anything in return, except they should think i am a good person aswell.

I really dont function in social situations, i am very ackward and introverted and i find it very hard to communicate with people and just have fun with them(might be more autism related)

I dont want to talk to people unless there is some kind of endgoal with it, usually my goal will be recognition, higher social status, or in general me obtaining something.

When i am with a group of people i feel superior too and i havd higher status than i will exploit that to put them down and have fun with saying incredebly rude and devaluing things, though if i believe it will start to have a consequense for me i will stop.

I do have a compass of what is right and wrong, but i am also very aware that i can just disregard it if i want to with no consequences and it is very tempting for me at times, but i feel superior if i dont do morally wrong things (this is mostly through the lense of social justice) its not that i dont care about the people, and if i am advocating for a minority, especially one i am a part of I do mean it, but a lot of that probably cones from me builiding my personality on being morally superior

I cant take critisicm, it makes me feel completely worthless and very angry/upset.

If i am hurting someone i dont really want to hurt, but they are disagreeing with me and i want to make my point, it doesnt really bother me that they got very upset, i do feel remorse if it hurt me indirectly (like my other friends being mad at me) but me making my point matters more to me than them not being upset

I dont really believe any of the relationships i have had that failed have been my fault, but i am starting to question it after learning about personality disorders.

I also have sone traits of narcissim that just dont really bother me so i havent listed them here, but the ones i have listed i feel like are making me hurt others which i do know is bad even if i dont care that much, but it will also hurt me in the end. I would like to feel empathy, i did when i was younger (like 3-4) at least i think but i am not sure. I mainly remeber traumatic stuff from before i was 12. I think people who dont feel like this are a lot happier and live better lifes.

I am currently trying to get an autism diagnosis because of other stuff but also because of some of these traits, i am 17 rn so that might make it easier for me to just talk to a therapist about these things without getting a diagnosis for a personality disorder?

Any emotions I feel all relate to my self-centeredness. I fit all the criteria of covert narcissists but fluctuate thinking I'm strongly intelligent and confident and hating myself altogether. When I considered the possibility that I am a narcissist, I felt regret. But the regret was in how many people I had been rejected by socially or driven off, for reasons that I'm becoming more self-aware of.

When it comes to friends, I can be callous, cruel, and easily offended. Some of our friend group conflicts were started by me perceiving slight in something someone said. Usually I'm not truly sorry. I'm only sorry because it caused people that I do fun activities with to temporarily shun me. I also hold grudges with an immense anger for longer than people think is normal. 

I have guilt. But the guilt I have for treating people this way is because I'm rating my worthiness as a person by how many non-broken bonds I have. At the time, I feel shame but then end up not caring what these people who have rejected me think.

I enjoy helping people. Though I'll feel pity for someone, I don't visualize/feel their situation without some hard effort.

What else? I was very entitled as a toddler and young child apparently. I feel guilt, but it's all about how it relates to me and how people see me. So I don't consider it genuine. I'm quite worried if I am a narcissist. If diagnosed, I think it would mean that narcissism is genetic in my family. I'd be worried for my kids feeling this way, constant subconscious shame.

I got the diagnosis of major depression at the age of 13. From then on I was the girl who must have low self esteem, who felt pressure to cut herself and who apparently wanted to die.

Let me start at my childhood. I was born in a somewhat wealthy family. When I was 2 my younger sister was born. I didn't like that. Growing up I would often hit her and intimidated her. One time I pooped in her bed and she got blamed for it. She was scared of me especially of my anger outbursts. Besides that we've played together a lot. In kindergarten I remember eating a piece of a birthday cake that was reserved for someone else. Of course I didn't admit to it but a different kid did even though he had nothing to do with it whatsoever. I like I wasn't blamed. However I often had stomach pain before going to kindergarten each day and often did not want to go. My mother says it was due to being anxious. In primary school I remember crying one time while giving a presentation.

My parents decided to get pets. So we had a dog who I loved. Despite that I would often beat her. I guess I took agression my father gave me out on her. He was prone to outbursts, shouting and slapping me. My mother did not like that but ended up denying it when I told the psyadric staff years later. Meanwhile my parents had a failing marriage. We also had two guinea pigs. I remember putting both of them into a tiny suitcase and throwing them down the stairs when I randomly got very angry. Upon impact the suitcases opened and the two of them were fine. You could say I abused my pets I would say. On the topic of that, I killed a pet snake after she escaped because I couldn't find her anymore and simply refused her water. I also got rats which I later released in the wild because my family was not happy with them. I don't regret what I did. In fact I have not felt guilt in my life ever. This is the main reason I believe I don't fit the criteria for depression. I don't think people know about this anyway so that could explain why I got depression and not something else. I think I got put into a box without looking deeper into my mind.

In fifth class I was more of a loner. My grades were okay but got worse over time. I then had to repeat seventh grade. I had a small circle of friends.

One day I remember a classmate opening a pencil sharpener and talking to other people how they could be hurtful to someone. That day I went home, opened mine and drew about four thin cuts on my arms. This lead to what I believe was more of an addiction. I had to hurt myself to feel better. By the way, I was never asked why I started it. People kept talking about some pressure which had to be released which apparently I did through cutting. I don't remember there being such a pressure. I just did it sometimes. Then my parents took me to a psychriatic hospital and I was interviewed.

So I got diagnosed with depression because:

\- I felt little emotion. Like a cloud was over them. Now (at the age of 22) I feel neutral most of the time.

\- I'd hurt myself

\- I did feel sad and cried often during my following teenage years. I also continued cutting myself.

\- My selfharm and frequent crying (main reason someone gets diagnosed with depression) just stopped apruptly. But I never received the therapy a person with depression and selfharm would need.

Another thing that surprises me that I had no problem with dressing heavily in alternative clothing, hairstyles and make up, I was also anxious and got a diagnosis for social anxiety. If people with anxiety care so much about how others view them, why would I dress in a way that says ""weirdo"" to begin with? At one point I got diagnosed with psychotic depression but that seems like a weak explanation at best.

The reason people believe I was depressed was that a lot of things happened at the same time. My parents split up, my beloved dog died (I never said goodbye or anything) and my ex was a douchebag. However this explanation does not resonate with me much and I just roll with it and the image of the struggling depressed kid who is now recovered.

I went through an emotionally abusive relationship during middle school. After about 9 months I was out of it and me and my best friend at the time both agreed he was a psychopath based on evidence but that is not relevant now.

Funnily enough though, one therapist I saw I showed potential signs of developing a personality disorder. The three ones that stood out mostly were schizoid, narcissistic and maybe antisocial and borderline. I now have the diagnosis that basically says you will sure have one in the future (my father is borderline). Still I have the diagnosis of depression and this other thing that is a lighter version of depression (can't remember the name).

I could ""become"" schizo according to her because I don't go out often even though I now have a boyfriend and we see each other frequently. He is an ideal marriage partner. I also would like to make friends however the ones I make are temporary and I am not regarded as a friend back? I have though about the possibilities of having autism as well, but I don't match the criteria in other aspects.

Realizing this made me remember I am surely going to have a personality disorder however it seems that looking over the diagnostic criteria of the ones I've mentioned don't seem to fit someone who was depressed. And I am certainly I am not depressed now.

Keep in mind I don't fit the criteria for any of the personality disorders mentioned (yet =)). I also don't think I ever fitted the diagnostic criteria for depression to begin with.

According to psymed this is a list of some criteria for a diagnosis and my experiences with them:

* Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day. (Not true now, but mostly true then.)
* Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day. (Low yes, but not ""diminished"")
* Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day. (Never true)
* A slowing down of thought and a reduction of physical movement (observable by others, not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down). (Never true)
* Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day. (Sometimes true then and now)
* Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt nearly every day. (I did feel worthless in the past sometimes. Not true today at all. Also I have never experienced guilt in my life, ever.)
* Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day. (Never true)
* Recurrent thoughts of death, recurrent sudicidal imagination without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide. (Never true. However I once told my abusive ex I tried to kill myself so he would care about me. That did not work as I later realized he never cared anyway)

88,Would you consider this covert narcissism?,7,nssgiz,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/nssgiz/would_you_consider_this_covert_narcissism/,6,1622887388.0,"I don't know if I'm a covert narcissist or have tendencies but here's why I think I might.

**Reasons why I think I'm a cover narcissist:**

(1) I have tons of power fantasies. The responsibility of power in real life is burdensome though so it stops at fantasies only.

(2) People who gets sick or become needy feel like a burden to me. I'll help but I'll be salty that there's no exchange. I'll build resentment towards them (but I'd still help them with the bare minimum).

(3) I prefer empaths for friendships/relationships because I get more bang for my buck.

(4) All my interactions feel transactional. Including with family. I do little things here or there with family just so that it doesn't feel that way but putting 100% of my effort for someone else in a moment of altruism when it isn't to repay back a favor is hard for me.

(5) My way of dealing with someone pissing me off is being passive aggressive or outright ignoring them.

(6) If someone attacks my ego, or someone I think I'm better than does better than me, I get REALLY salty. I'll keep it to myself and fume over it when I'm alone but I won't do anything direct about it. I'll just work to be better than them or go for a run.

(7) If someone I was close to for a long time pisses me off beyond a certain point or become a burden, I don't text them or anything. I just ghost and block them without saying anything.

(8) I can't nurture deep friendships. Almost all of my friendships are the product of transactions that fizzle out.

(9) I'm rarely ever emotionally available. I rarely actively reach out to a friend unless they keep hitting me up because I'm lost in my own world. The only exception is if I want something. In which case, I'll reach out and give them stuff first and hang out a few times so they don't feel like I only hit them up when I want something.

(11) I don't give with expectations but I almost always give with an acknowledgment that it increases my chances of getting what I want (even if it's not guaranteed and I'm not entitled to anything from someone). If the other person doesn't reciprocate much, I don't complain to them. I just cut the person off.

(11) If I could get away with it, I would keep using someone without reciprocating. The reason I don't do it is because if I rely on them too much, they'll have leverage over me and if too much resentment builds, they'll be mad and threaten to leave while having all the power in the dynamic & me needing them to stay afloat.

This is why I prefer empaths because I can still reciprocate but they bring more to the table for less effort. Meaning less leverage and even if they do a bit more, there's less threat of leaving.

(12) When someone I care about passes away, it's not necessarily the loss of them that I care about (other than a bit of nostalgia). The real loss comes from realizing that I can't rely on them for meeting a certain need for me. I remember a close friend in our friend group died and our group met up to reminisce about him and then I said ""damn. we need a replacement"" or some shit like that. I said it without thinking and they all laughed or were shocked and were like ""yo wtf"".

(13) When I was younger, I was told that I ""treat people like NPCs"". A sort of main character syndrome. This is no longer the case though.

(14) I've cheated and talked shit on partners when I was younger but we went on 2 dates and I didn't develop anything deep with them. They were also untrustworthy individually. For the only ""deep"" relationship I had, I felt an obligation by conscience to be loyal though.

(15) If I'm not getting positive feedback from others as a result of my behaviors, I start to internally panic.

(16) I can't imagine my partner having guy friends. I'd say this is more cultural than personality since it's viewed as a taboo in my culture for a woman to be giving any men attention besides in a work setting at a bare minimum level in my religion (before I left it). If you allow that, you're viewed as lesser as a man and it's also viewed as straight up cheating.

I also wouldn't have friends who are women so it wouldn't be one-sided. My partner can go out and all that and I wouldn't text them or ask for their phone. No paranoia shit but I just wouldn't be able to tolerate my partner clubbing, flirting with guys whatsoever, or having guy friends at all. That's my bottom-line and it's non-negotiable.

(17) If I feel like someone is ""lower"" level than me in terms of how society views them, I feel super comfortable and unthreatened around them. If I feel that someone is ""higher"" than me in terms of society, I feel on guard, insecure, and socially anxious.

(18) It took me a long time to recognize the needs of others. I avoid a lot of people now because it feels mostly burdensome to account for those needs.

**Reason why I don't think I'm a covert narcissist:**

(1) I can't take compliments.

(2) I don't think I'm special or important. At all.  I also don't believe I have a ""special group"".

(3) I can usually take accountability for my mistakes and reflect on them.

(4) I have a strong conscience. If I realize that my behaviors hurt someone and were out of pocket, I have to make up for them somehow or I'm buried in guilt. It doesn't matter if I gain anything from it.

(5) I never want to be famous. Unless it's anonymously. In that case, I'd love it. Any hate destroys my ego though.

(6) I don't feel powerful by manipulating someone. Manipulating feels BAD unless it's for payback, out of laziness, or for self-protection reasons. The only exception being if it's people I don't know at all and it's minor influence tactics.

(7) I never shame people or try to gaslight them. I HATE that crap. I NEVER ever attack someone's character, even if I'm FUMING in anger and it's in the middle of a heated argument. This is EVEN IF the other person used a character attack on me. At most, I'll point out their negative actions.

(8) I hate being a burden on others. The caveat is that this a projection of me not liking others being burdens to me. So maybe it's a way of self-protection.

(9) I don't lie about my accomplishments. It makes me feel icky.

(10) I don't force my own standards or values onto others. I value freedom of choice. I HATE pressuring anyone into anything.

(11) I will usually only ever lie to cover up something to benefit the relationship or protect myself. It won't be a lie that's blatant. Usually I'll deflect or engage in a white lie but I HATE lying when I don't have to.

(12) I don't wear anything superficial and I don't care about superficial titles.

(13) I met someone who I think is a REAL covert narcissist who was introverted and had grandiose expectations of wanting to be famous and special. They would speak of themselves as if they were god's gift to humanity. They demanded respect. Not commanded. DEMANDED.

They'd try to gaslight me a lot and push their standards on me. They were also very manipulative and would use shame or character attacks or criticism/sarcasm to get what they want. They also would use double speak and hide meaning in their statements to test me and get reactions out of me. It was weird af. I wouldn't have known had they not told me about it. When I called out suspicious behaviors, they would gaslight and deny while making it clear what they were doing for plausible deniability.

Seeing how prominent their narcissistic traits were and how much they influenced me, I started to wonder if I was as much of a narcissist as I previously thought. I felt unwell around them.

(14) In actual conversation, I try my HARDEST to never be dismissive. Even if someone said something dumb, I'll still try to see where they're coming from and validating their efforts without putting them down or being passive aggressive or sarcastic.",7

I'm a 30-year-old woman who has been in therapy for over 10 years. Diagnoses vary. But mine include: OCD, C-PTSD, and GAD. I would say, insofar as a attachment styles go, I'm a fearful avoidant (lots of push-pull). For the longest time, I thought I was struggling with co-dependency. I have had some stable partners, but as of last year, was confident I was discarded by a narcissist which set me out to do research. I am well aware I was raised by two narcissists. If you're familiar with Tudor--I'd say my mom is a middle mid-rage, and my dad is lower than her (very Trump-like), so I'm acutely aware of their cycles, and see characteristics in myself including:

Grandiosity

Love bombing (I idealize the shit out of people--but then I keep idealizing them. There's never really a decline. In fact I think I overstay in relationships)

SENSITIVITY TO CRITICISM

Truly, rejection debilitates me. I have thought maybe this was attachment wounds. Because rejection causes physical pain in my body and I can't overcome it. Like I'm unable to work/care for myself/function without the support of others. But then, to counter this, I isolate, because I don't want to be co-dependent, or over-rely on others. Still, I sense a ""using"" pattern when I'm in an anxious spiral. When my OCD kicks in, I reach out to friends for compulsive reassurance. This could be supply, I'm guessing. 

I have the temptation to lie all the time, but I fight it deliberately. I pride myself on honesty. But this could be grandiosity (maybe I've lied to myself as Tudor talks about--the mid-range types). 

When I'm unhealthy I am a total martyr, though I deliberately try not to play the victim (sometimes I fail).  

 I am ruled by shame. RULED. There's not an hour of my day I'm not ruled by shame. 

I, for the most part, feel below other people in power struggles (I've heard this can be a cover thing), but sometimes I feel like I'm ""better"" than other people, and I don't have the energy to care about the homeless man on the side of the road needing spare change. I don't always ""feel bad"" about things I should feel bad about. 

I've prided myself on being an empath because I can always feel and read others. But maybe this is just cognitive empathy? Sometimes I don't care, but I like to hold space for my friends, because I think it's important for it to not always be about me. 

My break-ups on the good end have been civil, but sometimes I've been hateful. I tend to repress my anger til the 11th hour, then tactfully put together letters of ""accountability"" that have angry undertones for my exes because I'm terrible at expressing myself verbally. So it's very much, ""When you did X, I felt Y, I couldn't express it at the time, but this is how I experienced it. I'm not sure if you intended that, but my experience is valid either way."" 

I have trouble distinguishing boundaries, and whose fault is whose, so I tend to take all the blame and stew in shame baths--which could be co-dependent, but I presume it could also be covert. I'm just curious about opinions. I watched some of Kanika Batra's Youtube videos--and tbh, I actually relate to some of the things she said, which concerned me. Namely, that I can't handle rejection. I am FRAGILE. I got rejected by someone I loved with my whole heart last year, and I'm still not over it. Like I'm depressed and I cry...every day. I would have done anything to fix it. I know it's unhealthy...but I'm wondering if it's also narcissism?",8

After that, my parents noticed I'd cry at everything. Since a child's brain is very much developing at that age, I'm pretty sure that event caused me permanent damage and wired my brain to produce tears at stresses normal people would get simply annoyed or inconvenienced by.

My father saw crying as ""evil"" and ""weak"". If I cried, I'd get yelled at, hit, and more details I won't go into. I never was taught to deal with my emotions, and never was allowed to even express them. My narcissistic traits definitely come from the attention I was given as a child (being accelerated, everyone put me on a higher pedestal and worshipped me at school, and I had good creative talents people would fawn over back then).

What came out of that, afterwards? Whenever something wouldn't go my way, whenever someone annoyed me, I wanted to put them in their place. I'd lie and cry and fabricate stories to get them in trouble—the equivalent of throwing a tantrum. Even now, I have raging desires to do that, but the risk of the law keeps me in check. 

I may have typical academic and lifestyle knowledge of my age, and I may know how to communicate with others very well now, but inside, my ego, my anger and my fear and desire to be appreciated?

I feel like I can't get the intrusive thoughts to stop unless I go back in time so I never made any mistakes, or if I get my revenge. But I can't do that because then I'd go to prison, plus they are so sick that they might see it as some kind of compliment or see it as them still being in control because I'd be giving them attention in a weird way even if it's setting them on fire.

And I do love her and I don't want her to hurt and I don't want her to die.  

I don't know why I'm writing this post. It's so huge I can barely think about it, let alone begin to talk about it and try to unwrap it in the hopes of dismantling it.  She is feeling despair. I am feeling despair.  

I just want her to know that I know I hurt her, badly, and it is because she wanted me to take responsibility. I want her to know that I know how apocalyptically disproportionate my reaction was.  I couldn't say this to her face because I'm a coward.  Because I'm afraid of my own reactions.  So I'm leaving this for her to find.

I love you.  I am sorry.  I should have stopped you.",31
94,Starting to think I have NPD,8,nx2rvr,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/nx2rvr/starting_to_think_i_have_npd/,4,1623370977.0,"*This is NOT a self diagnoses*
This past week I’ve been doing mass research on the symptoms of NPD and types of it because I suspect I might have it

It started when I researched “why do I get mad when my spouse cries,” because I was slowly self realizing that I had a pattern of being unnecessarily angry when my gf starts sobbing abt anything that seems minuscule to me (and sometimes it would be something appropriate to cry about and I still felt annoyed as shit) and I got some results that said people who tend to have a great lack of empathy have NPD

I dismissed it at first because my initial understanding of npd was just someone with a big ego and thought they were better than everyone else, and personally I didn’t feel like I was in that criteria but then...

I started seeing research about the highs and lows of emotions—feelings of grandiose(a new word to me lol) and then later feeling really put down. I related to this because I’ll always get into certain moods where I think I’m more than capable of any task at hand (in the moment) and other times I think I’m nothing more than an average person living an average life, in which, doesn’t sound bad to others, but to me, it takes the meaning of living away.

Next is my self esteem regulation. Although I will deny it to death in person, I do believe that my self esteem depends on what others say, or don’t say to me-which can be frustrating because I love to think of myself as “someone who doesn’t care what others think” but alas it’s like a drug to me, and I find myself on petty social media platforms posting or interacting w the sole reason of positive appraisal. (KIK for example, I hate the app and people on there but I find group chats on there anyways and stay there long enough to get hyped up/appraised). I also have a great sensitivity with criticism and will only accept it if I deem you did it in a “professional manner”. Anything else I’ll dismiss and assume you’re insulting 

Another thing is the exclusion anxiety. I figured I only suffered this when I was n school when the bell rang and everybody got up faster than me, leaving me behind. The feeling it gave me felt unmatched but I feel like I still feel that anxiety when everyone clocks out and leaves right before me, or when my spouse gets out the car faster. On top of that, I hate being ignored, specifically when Im just saying hi, though I try really hard to excuse the other person and justify it with “they must’ve not heard me” but then I’d find myself thinking abt that for 20 mins and get mad when I’m unsure. It feels like disrespect to me when you don’t acknowledge someone within a certain radius of you with the exception of being busy. But if you’re just walking doing nothing and you ignore my greeting i think about how much you must think you’re better than me for not saying hi back and my anger sits and boils for a long while after— to the point where I’d hold “subconscious grudges” lol 

Now when I read about how people w NPD value people and their relationships with them my eyes widen hard asfff. I used to think I had a “unique” mindset of only interacting with people that could benefit me the most, or hanging with people I thought had the most potential. This can often become an issue because I’d look down those who didn’t seem to care much abt their future or if they seem like they’re wasting potential, especially those who happen to have better circumstances than me. I have the greatest expectations of them and always think about how much more or better I could be doing with their circumstances, building a weird envy toward them. (Unmotivated rich kids got me fucked up the most!) 

And Speaking of value of people I’ve read something about state conscious where you form mental hierarchies in groups you are in. I relate to this because I am very picky about what groups I interact w because I don’t wanna be the dumbest or weakest person in the room. I wanna be held in a comfortably high position or come in at a point where I can get into a comfortably high  position among them. Thru this tho I may exhibit a sense of confidence and knowledge that I don’t actually have and try to fake it till I make it or leave and find another group. This can range from social media group chats to real life situations 

There’s a bit more that makes me think I have npd but I wanna cover it in a separate post when I talk my personal relationships and how I respond/react to things. But other than that, what do you think about my situation",8
95,I think i might be a narcissist but i want to change.,23,maj6mo,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/maj6mo/i_think_i_might_be_a_narcissist_but_i_want_to/,24,1616404619.0,"I think i might be a narcissist.

My [F20] childhood was not good. I spent most of my early years in fear of my stepmother who i believe is a narcissist. She would abuse me mostly emotionally but also physically from time to time. Examples of this were me not being allowed to eat at the same table as the rest of the family (my dad, her and her other children), being treated worse than her other children (although she did mistreat them as well) not being allowed to show negative emotion such as sadness and anger, and living in constant fear of what she might to next.

When i was not at my fathers place all my negative emotions came out. I was extremely angry towards my mother because i did not feel as she was protecting me by still making me spend every other week at my father’s place (i did not know that she was trying her best to get sole custody) i lashed out at other children at school by being violent and a bully. I was extremely jealous at other children who got attention from my family members, especially my mother. And i learned to manipulate people to get my way at a very young age.

I lacked empathy throughout most of my childhood and i got to hear this often. I do have empathy now but not as much as other people. I did not have issues with breaking rules.

When i became a teenager i started doing illegal things such as taking drugs, stealing, robbing people and being violent. This got me in lots of trouble because i was very small and not capable of inflicting damage as i was before. This led to me being the victim of violent crimes myself.

I have a strong sense of entitlement, i cant stop lying and i manipulate people everywhere i go. My relationships have consisted of idealization, devaluation and discard. 

I have very strong emotions and mood swings and lots of people think i may have bpd. I can agree with that to some extent but i do not have the same fear of abandonment that borderlines have. I only have fear of abandonment in the early stages of a romantic relationships, but when i feel that i have the person under control i do not feel that anymore.

I lie a lot. I have created a whole fake life and it can get tiring to keep my facade up. I tell different lies to different people to make each person like me. Nobody really knows me because i lie about everything. I also keep telling small and irrelevant lies in my daily life and i cant seem to stop.

I cannot take the slightest critisizm and i get very angry when someone dares to critizise me. I have very low confidence but at the same time i feel that i am superior to others, i believe i am smarter and prettier than other people and when i feel like someone does not recognize that i feel shame and rage. Before the pandemic i was around other people all the time and got told i was pretty and smart by different people daily. My ego was very inflated. Now that i dont spend as much time around people and dont get that positive feedback i feel like i am worthless.

Now i am in a relationship with a guy that i really care for and i know he wants the best for me. I keep hurting him and abusing him and i regret it afterwards. I really want to change for him since i really do care for him but when i get angry all that disappears and i only want to hurt him. I use him as an emotional puching bag but i really do not want to do that. 

I read that narcissist do not want to change, if that is the case then what am i? My behaviours align with narcissism but i am aware of them and i do not want to be this way. It causes me so much pain and chaos and i really do not want to live like this.

I go to a psychiatrist from time to time and i am on mood stabilizers for my mood swings. I dont know how to tell them that i think i am a narcissist for fear of not being believed or them disliking me. I want to talk to a psychologist but dont know how to explain my situation.

Is there anyone here in my situation that really wants to change or anyone who has gotteh help for their npd? How did you do it?",23

Growing up wasn't super easy for me, I was the first born for my father and youngest of two with my mother. I was quite a talented kid in terms of sports. I was scouted for pro teams at the age of 11. My dad was super hard on me in terms of sports. From a very young age I was given a lot of shit for having a bad game of rugby league by my father, as early as the age of 6. I remember being yelled at after my first game ever.  At home with my father was always hell. He was in multiple abusive relationships that consisted of fighting, screaming and yelling basically every night. It was a relief when there was a night of peace. There were a few times he would threaten suicide during arguements with his partners and do stuff like guilt tripping and manipulation. He was a very violent man growing up and had severe anger issues. My mother who I mostly lived with on the other hand, was much more sensitive, quiet and prone to anxiety. After a still birth and her parnter cheated on her she became an alcoholic and spent her time sleeping, drinking and partying. There wasn't much care given to me and my brother. I would get away with not going to school and a lot of other bad shit. Despite that, she tried to protect me from a lot of the bad shit in the world, so naturally I grew up not believing I couldn't look after myself. 

The reason I mention my parents is because I am noticing things in me that resemble covert narcissism, and it has a lot to do with childhood traumas. Recently I was dating an amazing girl, she was studying social work at the same uni I was going to and we even went on holiday over new years together. At first when we were just getting to know each other it was really good. I was courteous and reciprocal and everything was going smoothly. When she mentioned exclusivity however was when I noticed a huge sense of entitlement on my part. I Started becoming super clingy and using guilt tripping and manipulation to win her affection. eventually she just wanted to be friends and I pretended to take that on the chin, however the weekend came and I drunk texted asking to have her back. She told me I was breaking boundaries and I still did it. What made me super unhappy was the thought of her with someone else and not having that connection we once shared. It ate me up and this is where I started realising the selfishness and narcissistic nature behind my actions. As someone who swore I was there for this girl, I clearly showed I was only looking out for myself and as she put it ""communicating my own needs, not trying to help her"" and yeah she was right. that's exactly what I was doing. It closely resembled an incident I had with another girl where I did something very similar. I thought I had learned from it and Clearly I hadn't which is the fucked up thing. 

I definitely notice grandiose behavior. I sometimes fantasise about being a pro athlete even though I am doing nothing to become one. I can be very vain despite being obese at the moment. I think my issues are too unique to be overcome at times and I am super afraid of socialising. I can't make friends or even be around people for too long unless im certain they actually like me. I have created what feels like a fantasy land in my head that I am not like other people, sometimes this means being better than them, other times worse. I have come to the conclusion I really need help. I want to be someone who is known for their gratitude and love, not this nasty version of me who is super self-absorbed and an absolute asshole. I just want to be better and I guess this is why I am reaching out to this sub-reddit. Thanks for reading!

99,Unhealthy obsession with a girl on Instagram since 3 Years.,28,mihmyq,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/mihmyq/unhealthy_obsession_with_a_girl_on_instagram/,10,1617359620.0,"**Please read till the end.**   


**Backstory**

M29. Never dated anyone. Never even approached anyone. Grew up in environment where it was a little bit taboo to be fraternizing with the opposite sex. Fear of being called out for that developed a very huge anxiety of the opposite sex in me.

Never really came out from it. Arranged marriage is very much part of my culture and my family puts a lot of pressure for it. Recently due to my anger outbursts they don't really speak about it though there is a tension of that matter always. I still live with them. Though communication with them is very low now. I practically just exist in the house like a zombie.

I have always wanted to love someone. Or to be honest ""to be loved"". To be with someone. to be important for someone.

But that never really happened and probably never would due to my extreme anxiety, and the reality that I am probably extreme NPD. Never really got diagnosed.

  
**Now the obsession part**.

So i got really attracted to this girl when I saw her in a movie (yeah) couple of years back. So much so that all I can think of is her. I read every article about her, Saw all her interviews. I have a compulsion to open her insta, her fan pages, all the other hashtags every day multiple times. I then download all the media, so if someone ever deletes it, I still have that.

It has been like this for ever now. I fantasize about being with her. Having  life with her. Having kids, living the best life. That is my fantasy that I live every day in my mind. 

To be honest, the fantasies, the rage are not at the same level as they used to be a year back. But they certainly are there. There are some good days and some bad days.

Everyday 5-10 times I get this sudden rush of realty and fear rushes through my body. that she would never be with you. she would never even know you in her entire life. My hear beat jumps to 130-150.

**What triggered now to write this post.**

Saw her in a new trailer and saw her kissing another costar. felt some emotion trigger. don't know what but don't feel good. 

**What now?**

I want to visit a therapist. But am really ashamed to talk about this. I feel like they would really judge me and wont actually help me.

Though I also have ADHD(self diagnosed). I feel like if I get help for that atleast, and get my life back together, this obsession would go away.",28

I imagine regardless of whether or not I’m diagnosable, resources on how to cope with or reduce the impact of npd would help me. However, a lot of them specifically relate to narcissistic anger (I think i saw some people here call them tantrums but I’m not certain) - I don’t experience this in the sense of outbursts when I feel vulnerable, so they feel less useful to me.

I find that while i do semi-regularly obsess over ways I could verbally hurt people in response to perceived slights, I very rarely do it in practice; this isn’t an ethical or empathetic decision, but rather a result of the fact that without certainty that I can indisputably frame myself as the innocent party I might damage other people’s perceptions of me. Does anyone else experience this? 

Could this be related to narcissism? I’m pretty uneducated right now, especially as to the different kinds of narcissism, but there doesn’t seem to be many resources that I can find that discuss manipulation and a need for social affirmation as being equally serious concerns, if not more so, for someone looking to overcome narcissistic tendencies.",5
102,Having PDS without Having an Abuser - How Abusive Environments Can Create Personality Disorders - My Story,29,m9xco6,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/m9xco6/having_pds_without_having_an_abuser_how_abusive/,9,1616335499.0,"Happy Sunday!

To begin, my belief is that NPDs can be created by both heredity and/or nurture.

For me, I believe my father was NPD, but I wasn't raised by him and he wasn't really in my life with the exception of 3 or 4 cameo appearances. However, the patterns and behavior he displayed would fall into line with him having been afflicted. My mother was incredibly loving, supportive and taught me how to have self-esteem and self-love.

I've learned that my pds were created from growing up in an extremely abusive environment not from abusive people. I had spent time in foster care and bouncing around different family members homes not because of abuse at home but because my primary caregiver would have to go to the hospital 3-4 times a month sometimes as many 12 times a month. Each time the possibility of her dying was there. She suffered from a ruthless disease that would make her suffer crisis putting her in so much pain we'd have to call ambulance or call a cab and a trip to the hospital often ended up with me and my siblings spending a night or two at the hospital until we'd get picked up by family.

The episodes would occur randomly, sometimes we'd be having the time of our lives at the annual State Fair and all of a sudden police would be having to disperse the crowd to make room for ambulance. Me and my sibling took countless trips in the ambulance and bring at hospital was like second nature. The disease my mother had said she was unlikely to live past her 6 years old at the time she was born and by the time I was born it was early 20s if lucky. So each crisis created an abandonment, each crisis the possibility of becoming an orphan was a threat.

Many times as I got a little bit older, I'd stay home alone with my brother for a day or two when our mom would go to ER so that we wouldn't have to leave home at 1am and then figure out a way to make it to school from hospital, so like many Narcissists I was parentified and required to have the emotional and mental maturity if an adult from age 6.

Because of her disease, she was rarely able to attend school events, parent conferences, and do things typical parents did with their kids. She couldn't drive so the times we'd be able to do things outside the home we few and far between and because of the amount of energy it took out of her, those times would often end up in a crisis, either the same day or within that week. Doing fun things with my mom increased the threat of imminent abandonment (her having to go to hospital) and death. Fun times always came with anxiety, worry and fear. That got drilled into me.

I'm not sure I know a life without anxiety and it seems it makes me even more anxious trying not to be. I am most comfortable and in my ""natural state"" being very anxious, worried and afraid of my environment. Being prepared and anticipating tragedy almost all the time. I've gotten much better with that now, but the internal anxiety I dont think I'll ever live without. Luckily, my mother had no addictions except to shopping because that was basically the only thing she could do with us throughout the seasons. Though ambulance picking us up from the mall was also a common occurrence.

Finally, right before turning 16 I got ""the call"". My siblings and I hadn't lived together nor with my mom for 3-4 years by then because they figured us living permanently with family would give us more stability.  We found out the same day we were removed from each other. The day before my most anticipated school field trip, skiing, which we were never able to do with mom because time spend in the cold outdoors meant 100% crisis. Even winter itself brought on increased trips to hospital (talk about how to develop Seasonal Affective Disorder!).

Anyway, while at my job at 15 my manager calls me to the back and let's me know I have a phone call. The blood had gone from her face and was pale white. She didn't look happy but I still did not expect what was about to happen.

I picked up the phone and within moments was on the floor devastated by the news that my brother and I were now orphans. The moment I had been practicing all my life, the moment I had been conditioned to be ""waiting"" for.

I got picked up by a family member to go to where my mother had been living to find out from her caretaker what happened. Except, unbeknownst to me, my mother's dead body was still in her room. Even worse, when I opened the door to enter her room just to be around her things is when I found out not only was her dead body still there on the ground, but my younger sibling weeping over it, just like Mary wept over Jesus.

Unable to take it, I ran out the house and ran to a lake near by, hoping the frozen ice would break so I can finally too be taken out of my miserable life in which I had to go to school each day and somehow pretend like my sole caregiver dying wasn't in the back of my head.

The ice didn't break. I was crying so hard and my soul was giving up. Since the ice didn't break, I screamed and prayed so hard that God just take me. I had so much anger that this life was not fair and that indeed even God would not answer my prayers for a cure for my mom's disease. I said God please just take me I no longer want this.

Still crying, I could see from afar the morgue taking my mom's dead body in the black bag. I went into a delirium. I was still crying, but a level of mental seriousness came about me. I said ""please God take me. I do not want this anymore"".

On my Momma's dead body, the Holy Spirit came to/through me. I felt like I was on Cloud 9, literally. I've had morphine before and this was like morphine x 1,000,000 running through each and every cell of my body. For ONCE in my life I felt at Peace.

Then a ""voice"" came in my head and said, ""it is okay. it is okay if this [death] is what you want, and you will be given it"". With absolutely zero sense of judgment, worry or disdain, just Love and support, the ""voice"" spoke to my ""spirit"" and said, ""it is your choice. Now choose"". My God, I could not believe this was happening! I was so happy and surrounded by an impeccable energy of Peace, Love and Acceptance. I knew 1000% whatever I chose in that moment, ""Thy Will Be done"". I felt a Freedom I have never felt like that before nor since.

All of this happened in what seemingly was no earthly time. It was just me and God and Peace ""happening"". Everything happening in sequence but also at the same time.

Before I ""chose"", a vision of my brother crying over my mom's dead body came into my head and my ""heart""...

I yelled, ""NOOOOOOO!!!"" overcome with crazy emotion of sadness and defeat. Not because I was choosing to leave my brother, but because in that instance my ""spirit"" chose and I was going to be dammed to this miserable earth because no way was I going to leave my brother alone and an orphan. I yelled ""no"" because I had the chance to go to the Heavens with my mom and I said no. Make no mistake, it was my decision and I was at more than peace with it. But there's nothing like living the torture I had lived those 16 years and getting the chance to leave but not and I was going to be committed to this life no matter what happened now.


That was the most spiritual encounter I had and I am always going to be a believer until the day I die because of that time. It's real and I don't care what anyone has to say about it.

After my decision was made, an overwhelming sense of Peace came over me, it was like I was hungover with the euphoria from the spiritual morphine and I was settled.

I walked back to the house to go onto living a life full of personality disorders and mental health issues. But a life worth living and a life with Faith that I am Good and I am here for a reason.

That's how personality disorders like Narcissism, BPD and Sociopathy can be developed without abusers or other people with personality disorders being an influence.

It's not that long, just really spaced out to make it easier to read quicker.

EDIT: Edited to make it clearer, repeat itself less. And in fact to just make it much better.

&#x200B;

**In researching my own shit I've come across a lot of articles and videos that basically paint narcissists are evil monsters on the scale of evil psychopaths. It's just not true.**

Sure there are always going to be people who are fucking horrible, but really people with narcissistic injuries are SO common.

It is SO common in society at some level or another, half our fucking civilisation is powered and propelled by people with delusional self confidence and a desperate need to achieve things to feel self worth.

And that's just the minority that succeed in that, most people with narcissistic tendencies are people who are just insecure in themselves, because they were so severely hurt by others. And they can be paradoxically held back from achieving anything they really want to do by the crippling lack of self esteem and fear that lives inside of them. Often very hidden even from ourselves, and causes us nothing but extreme psychological torture and pain.

Have you ever read the social defeat model of depression?

It says that if you have a social defeat your serotonin lowers as a response, as a survival mechanism, to reorder you in the social hierarchy and to stop you challenging anyone higher in the hierarchy than you for your own safety.

Studies show people and animals higher in the social hierarchy have higher serotonin, even if it wasn’t earned or deserved, even if they have that position by accident. And people lower down the food chain have the lowest serotonin, serotonin being the confidence molecule. If a rat wins a fight in a lab, even if it won by accident and didn’t do anything (helped by the researcher), that rat has higher serotonin. And will act more dominant and confident, and the other rats will act more submissively around it. And then even after one fight, that rat with higher serotonin is more likely to win the next fight, and the fight afterwards. If a rat loses a fight, even unfairly caused by the researcher, its serotonin drops. And it’s more likely to lose the next fight and the one after. And acts more submissively. If that rat wins the next fight even by accident, it’s serotonin goes back up.

In the social defeat model of depression, if you keep getting socially defeated (bullies, parents) then serotonin will keep lowering, your confidence will keep lowering. And it won’t go back up until you get some social wins.

I see narcissism as a response to that. if you feel you’re at the bottom of the social hierarchy in life... your serotonin will be low.

What’s a good way around this apart from acceptance into the groups and getting social wins? Especially when you’ve been rejected or even abused, and acceptance seems impossible?

Short cut the hierarchy altogether.

Not only is their hierarchy bullshit, I’m not at the bottom of it I’m in fact better then everyone else.

I’m the top of a better hierarchy, and they’re just too stupid and shit to realise it. I’m not worthless, I am in fact better than everyone else. They are below me.

So it works wonders to raise serotonin from the pit of despair, and to make you not give a shit about people’s opinions, gives you a bit of serotonin confidence so you don’t break down, so you can survive.

Look at the kids who were severely bullied in school that ended up cutting themselves to pieces, or attempting suicide. That would have been a lot of us if we didn’t become narcissistic as a way to protect ourselves.

Every human does this to some extent, make themselves feel better by pumping themselves up and putting other people down.

**Complex-PTSD is likely the cause of most narcissism, not all (there's still acquired narcissism like celebrities), but probably most of it. And what is CPTSD and NPD really? Or even BPD?**

**A survival mechanism a child develops to SURVIVE ABUSE and NEGLECT. Narcissism was a way to deal with this trauma, to build an armour made of inflated ego to protect the hurt child inside.**

People developed fantasies and maladaptive daydreaming to protect and soothe themselves. Soothe themselves from the pain and crippling anxiety of their lives, to give them some form of hope so their neurotransmitters don’t drop through the floor and they become suicidal.

It's a normal defence mechanism that gets out of hand because what was done to you was disproportionately harsh, your brain had develop an extreme response to survive it.

To survive being hurt unfairly by people who's validation you depended on to develop.

But when you're looking for help for yourself, to heal this trauma so you can be a better person, be kinder and connect better with people, to have better relationships...

All the really nice goals of GOOD PEOPLE...

What does the internet say? You are a fucking monster, evil incarnate, incapable of ever healing and ever being a good person. No information or empathy out there to help you at all. No books, no understanding, no hope. No empathy for a victim. No help. Change is impossible.

Man fuck that shit, it's BULL SHIT. I found out years ago and it was truly crushing but I've been getting better ever since. And when I found out about CPTSD and started going through that healing model, I got even better than I had in the last decade. Therapy and micro-dosing psychedelics accelerated it even more so, and I've improved more in the last 6 months then I have in the last 3 years.

I feel like I've healed a lot of what I thought was an un-healable wound, an un-saveable personality, an un-redeemable person.

It's work, but it's worth it. Just got to get that ball rolling, and keep it rolling. Focus on healing that unstable core inside of you. Inside all of us is our core beliefs and narratives about ourselves.

We built this armour to protect ourselves, but we feel hollow inside, it feels like we have only a solid shell. A shell that can crack. And when people threaten that shell or hit it, we react in extreme defence. Because deep down we are terrified that the armour will break, and inside all that pain and sorrow will come pouring out. All those toxic beliefs about ourselves learned from others will take over our minds and crush us, with unbearable pain. And as we feel that we ARE this ego shell, if the shell breaks and crumbles so do we, it feels like we will die.

You need to let that toxic shit out, bring it to the surface and let it out as best you can. Or fucking drive it out by filling that core with something better. An unshakable belief, with the fucking truth.

That you are a good person, worthy of love. You were born good, and have so much goodness in you. You are not perfect, but no one is, you’re definitely not the worst in the world. Even though you make mistakes you are worthy of love, just like everyone else you see in the world who makes mistakes and still finds love. Drive this belief to the deepest part of your soul, and let it burn there with a righteous fervour. An unshakeable truth.

Use the power of that obviously true belief to build a core of solid fucking rock and RADICAL SELF-ACCEPTANCE. A core so solid it is un-moveable by others attacks. So solid that it has a quiet confidence, it doesn’t feel the need to aggrandise itself, it doesn't need to lash out to defend itself.

A fucking boulder doesn’t worry about getting hit, it’s made of solid fucking rock. An attack or sleight might chip the surface a little, but the core is still solid as a fucking rock. Build that core layer by layer with radical self acceptance, self forgiveness, self compassion, and for the completely normal Flaw-some human animal you are.

And continue to do the work, the work never stops. No one escapes doing things that keep their mental health in good shape, not even the greatest people who ever lived, and neither do you. If you don't, the solid rock will erode just by the wear and tear of wind and life. If you don’t kept strengthening your body, eventually it will decay, your mental health is the same.

Get strength from good relationships and friendships, and connection. Use the healthy relationships to heal this wound and fill this core. Add more fuel to the fire inside that burns any underserved shame out of it, and shove more fucking rock in there. Constantly strengthen these deeper layers in healthy ways, keep adding those layers. By being vulnerable with safe people, good people, and being accepted and loved. And shove that fucking good shit all the way down deep inside of you. Lock that shit in there, hoard that good shit and keep adding more. If there’s no one around, shove that healthier stuff in there yourself, add more fuel to that true core belief, that you are a good person who is worthy of love. Keep this core solid and stable. Add layers until you are full to the fucking brim of solid fucking rock. Calmly sure of itself.

It's not your fault you didn't have anyone who helped build core self-esteem like they were supposed to. That's not your fault, and it's fucking shit that you have to do that now yourself. I know fam, it's shit.

But everyone had to build these cores slowly and over time. Every person on the planet. Sometimes I have the completely irrational belief that if I have to work on something then it’s not really me, so it’s not real. Like everyone else was born great, and I wasn’t. So if I do something good or have to work to achieve something then it’s not real.

But it's a fucking fallacy, even the greatest people had to build these cores. Either when they were young, or usually with some of the greatest people... when they were older. Everyone has to work on themselves to change or achieve anything. No one was born great or wonderful, we were all born innocent and unknowing. The rest is learning and work. No one escapes the work. When you see people in movies it all looks effortless, but that’s nonsense. No one ever sees the work behind the scenes. When it comes to self-esteem people build up their self-esteem over time, usually with the help of caring parents and the others around them who give them unconditional love. It’s not your fault someone else fucked up that responsibility.

Imagine you are caring for an innocent animal, because that's what you were when you were a child, an innocent animal. Who didn't understand, and was just trying to learn how to behave to not get hurt. Be the person who cares for that animal now.

Do it for yourself. And on days when you really need motivation...

Do it out of fucking spite to the cunts who hurt you. Do it out of righteous fucking anger. Heal yourself as the ultimate fuck you.

You took the hardest death blows they could give, and you can heal from it and become stronger than they ever were. You can become a better and more loving person than they ever were. They are the weak ones. Too much of a coward to own up to their mistakes, too scared to face this pain and take it on.

Do it out of grief for something that could have been that was lost, and now you can bring into reality. A stable internal core model of yourself, healthy, strong, kind, peaceful, stable, solid. Do it out of empathy for yourself and for others, empathy for those innocent animals that were hurt. Just like you.

A human cannot remake themselves without suffering, because they are the sculptor and the clay. Embrace the pain, what you resist persists. The obstacle IS THE WAY.

You can do this, it takes time but you CAN DO IT. I am living proof, especially all the mistakes I've made and the shame that has tortured me for years in overt and covert ways, and all the weird ways it has manifested in behaviour. And the shame and collapse that drove me to be suicidal for a year.

Our behaviour and our actions are our responsibility and no one else’s. But you are here taking responsibility for that behaviour and trying to change it. That doesn’t mean we’re all saints, but we don’t need to torture ourselves everyday with toxic guilt. It just gets in the way of us ever healing or changing, because it makes us feel like we are worthless and can’t change, that isn’t hope.

But YOU are not your behaviour. Your behaviour came from a psychological health condition someone else inflicted upon you. That does not mean you are a bad person deep down, otherwise you wouldn’t all be here trying to learn and grow! You’ve got some behavioural habits to work on! Haven’t we all! Doesn’t everyone!

Because YOU, your internal conscious awareness of your body and being alive, is NOT your behaviour. Your brain is an electric meat learning machine, that learned automatic behaviour to help it survive in the environment you grew up in.

YOU are NOT your behaviour. YOU have nothing to be ashamed of when your body reacted automatically and makes mistakes. Reactions that you don’t have conscious control over most of the time. Most of you didn’t even know your behaviour was narcissistic.

You weren’t even aware of it, your brain hides most of your bad behaviour from you and from your memory to help keep you moving.

But once you found out? Well here you are here making moves to be better, to change those behavioural habits.

You are here because YOU WANT to heal, YOU WANT to be nicer to people, YOU WANT to have better loving connections with people, YOU WANT to be a better person. No automatic reaction or unconscious behaviour made you come here, YOU did. This was YOUR conscious decision to work on this behaviour.

Does that sound like a monster to you? Fuck that. You people are doing fucking great. Think about all the people who never want to change, who behave insanely worse than any of us. No one here has done anything so unredeemable that they are not worthy of love or life. No one here has done anything worse than the normal shit humans do. No one here has ethnically cleansed a village or raped children for fucks sake.

Think about all the people you’ve met in life who weren’t narcissists and were still complete cunts? It’s a fucking LOT of people. Are you really that much worse than any of them, or all of them? Really? Because you made some mistakes as well? They’ve all made mistakes, but it gets chalked up to human mistakes. They’re not branded as predators who can never change.

I’m so fucking sick of this undeserved toxic shame that hangs on my soul like a fucking weight. Fuck shame, shame is a fucking liar.

You're just trying to get help so you can be nicer to people. You're doing GREAT.

As I've got better I've managed to feel empathy more deeply for people. And in that empathy for other people I’ve found some empathy for myself, not a blown up ego of my self, my core self. The vulnerable and hurt child inside of me who makes mistakes.

Everyone says we can’t heal, well that is BULL SHIT. I’m not all the way there, but I’m working on it motherfucker, and I am fucking winning. I’m turning this shit around. And so can you.

Hurt people hurt people, and healed people heal people.

You didn't choose this survival mechanism, you had no idea what the long term consequences were going to be. You’re not in charge of the human race, you didn’t evolve this common response to bullying, you had no fucking idea what was happening, you didn’t plan this shit. You were a child for fucks sake. You were just trying to survive the pain.

You are all good people, you were ALWAYS good people, you didn't deserve that shit, you were always **good**.

You never had anything to be ashamed about, nothing to be insecure about.

You deserved to be supported in your development as a vulnerable child, as was your god damn birth right.

Without having to resort to developing yourself and doing the best you could as a child.

Someone should have helped you strengthen from the core out, so you didn’t have to build an ego armour to protect you from the constant attacks.

Built from whatever you could use.

And all you had were your thoughts and beliefs. That's all you had to work with as a child.

Really you did a pretty fucking great job.

There was never anything wrong with you, there was something wrong with them. Something very wrong with how they treated you.

You deserved love and acceptance, you always did.

You don't have to be perfect to deserve love now, and you don't have to be better than anyone else. You don't have to seek validation or supply from anyone else.

Be your own validation, be your own supply of love.

You deserve love and acceptance right now.

Human mistakes and all. x

Back when I was 26 (and very isolated/mentally ill) I joined a waterpolo team. It was a big change for me, I loved it and played for 3 years. But there was a psychologist on the team. He is very 'anti' narcissism and spends a lot of time criticising us. He seemed to make it his goal to psychologically destroy me.

I don't fully understand what he did to me, but he lowkey invalidated and undermined me, openly laughed at my relationships, and took great care to expose my narcissistic vulnerabilies. Things tended to be quite nasty and dark whenever he was around. I had poor boundaries back then and didn't know how to deal with it. It gradually escalated over the years and I started to feel trapped (he was a member of most of my social groups).

During this period (and since) I've been doing therapy, meditation, and other change behaviours. My therapist and I eventually landed on the topic of my narcissism. When I managed to ""break through"" and admit to myself that I am a narcissist, I had a MASSIVE mental breakdown. Like experiencing paranoia, panic, suicidality, intense emptiness, dissociation.. etc. When this happened I realised that those uncomfortable conversations with the teammate were all regarding my narcissism.

I became incredbily paranoid about him, convinced that he knew I was a narc, was trying to treat me, and that I was 'trapped'. Well when I saw him he could immediately tell that I was different. We spoke breifly, I told him that I was unwell. He prompted me to tell him why. I told him that I thought I was special. He laughed uproarously into my face.

I was 'retratumatised' by the experience (according to my therapist - I was bullied a lot growing up). I left the waterpolo team, and many friendship groups, so I've had a pretty isolated life since. Before treatment I was a bitter person, but during I had been able to be vulnerable and forgive those who had hurt me and I had come out of it. But since that day I've been obsessively bitter and resentful. It's been demoralising and I regret allowing him to be involved in my personal business like that. I've lost years because of this.

Can anybody relate? Does anybody understand? And do you find yourself in a state of constant anger?

105,Self-loathing,7,njcmo1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/njcmo1/selfloathing/,2,1621791242.0,"Hi everyone. I have covert narc traits, and anger management problems. My  irritability might be because of anxiety/overstimulation from autism, but ultimately it doesn't matter when I snap at people :/ I'm just being an asshole. My intentions or what I'm going through doesn't  matter. I'm working on it now and improving, but I definitely was  impatient/short with other people and reacted very negatively to  criticism before.

It's  getting to a place where several people people are taking revenge on me  (by gossiping behind my back, making me look like I made a mistake when I didn't, etc.) and it's giving me pause. I never thought I  could be the sort of person who could do something so bad that I would  ""get what I deserved"" or deserve to have bad things happen to me. I  can't blame anyone who's had to deal with my irritability for hating me.  And I can't blame them for taking revenge. I think they're in the  right.

I feel so much self-hatred  and shame sometimes. It makes me want to keep acting out because I feel  like I'm a terrible person who deserves to be hated. I reached out to  someone whose feelings I hurt some time ago, and they responded. I felt  shock and I cried. And part of me wanted them to not respond - part of  me wanted them to hate me for the rest of their life because I guess  part of me feels like that's what I deserve.

These  feelings are super unproductive. I know the only thing worth doing is  trying to make amends to the people I've hurt, and try genuinely to  change. And accept their rejection and not expect anyone to be nice to  me even though I'm trying to improve. I feel like part of me thinks I  can't handle other peoples' rejection if I genuinely try to work on  myself and they still hate me forever, so it's like I'd rather just not make amends and just accept them hating me forever. I know I'm thinking about  this in a delusional/self-centered way - no one owes anyone else  forgiveness or understanding, especially when I've been rude or hurtful  to them.

When other people are  rude to me, it makes me angry, even though I know their rudeness is  warranted if I started it. I try to be nice but then I feel like I come  off as passive-aggressive/fake nice. I am trying to cultivate a real  deep kindness inside myself but I guess it's going to take time.

Has  anyone been through these feelings, that they deserve to be hated by  everyone? How did you move to a place of genuinely working on yourself  instead of trying to punish yourself somehow by wanting other people to  hate you and failing to make amends or even continuing to hurt other  people? I know this is so toxic, because it is about other peoples'  feelings and lives not just me. I want to change but I feel like I get  in this loop of self-loathing.

Thanks for reading. You can be really blunt in your responses, too, if you care to respond.",7
106,Hi I don’t have empathy for anyone,1,m6ogty,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/m6ogty/hi_i_dont_have_empathy_for_anyone/,21,1615943475.0,"I was a bully as a kid I bullied this kid named Zander who drew cars because I wanted to Idk why I did it till this day. One time I took his sweater and he tried to get it back so I stepped on his knee. Idk if I actually hurt him but he didn’t get up and some girls picked him up and took him inside. I always remember getting told on because I used to say things but I don’t remember what i said. In high school I had 7 girlfriends four at the same time and I told each of them they were amazing but in reality I just didn’t care they were toys that would do anything I told them to.  I cheated on my ex with three different people in the same school and I would get caught by them and just said I wanted them more then the other girl and kept cheating. I knew I hurt my ex for 2 years she found out about the other three girls. She was madly in love with me. I thought I was just a player I was just normal but all my relationships were based on the foundation of scare tactics and violence and not being a victim I literally made friends who could protect me I don’t rly care about them I would hope they die (well everybody in my life) so I could be upset and get to act irrationally or hurt whoever was responsible. One time I was at six flags and I remember threatening the dude who was managing the go cart because he miscounted how many times we went I remember grabbing him and feeling liberated to get physical with someone. I love fighting and attacking ppl and seeing ppl be attacked. I don’t like anyone bc their just another person I don’t know how long I’ve been like this but everyone is just a game of stay in my life so I don’t look like a loner or so I have protection. I recently got dumped bc I said my gf was a weirdo I said things before that upset her but I thought that she was weak or just being her but I do it all the time I even apologize just to get her to give me attention. I don’t know what to do or how to apologize to the ppl around me because they don’t know I’m just here to manipulate them and that their interchangeable. I treat friendship as a transaction I just say whatever makes ppl like me I don’t feel their pain I’m just there for whatever emotions they might muster up bc emotions mean violence and I’m good at it it’s straight forward it doesn’t require sympathy or thought. 
I don’t want to hurt ppl but I do I verbally degraded my real relationships and manipulate girls who are suicidal by telling them I would care if they were gone when in reality I wouldn’t care bc I’m the dude with a dead gf plus it’s not my fault the relationship ended she just died. I don’t know where to go from here putting myself down seems like the logical answer bc I hurt ppl in everyday conversations I view everything like war and have said things that are rly fucked up. I still don’t rly feel bad for the ppl I hurt I just feel bad I’m a terrible person ig. I do have two definite emotions that alternate anger and sadness sadness turns into anger 99% of the time and my anger makes me feel like just picking up a knife and stabbing someone to death. I carry knives bc if someone messes with me I would have a reason to cut em. I fantasize about cutting someone down the right side of their face and having them remember for the rest of their life that I cut em. The pandemic is making it easier bc everyone wears masks. I often follow ppl around when I’m bored bc it’s fun to know I’m watching someone and could just run up and stab and kill them and their family and friends wouldn’t know why or who.  I just don’t know how to tell ppl this without them getting scared or thinking I’m crazy. My gf knew I would kill someone and says ur a narcissist all the time but i don’t know if she knew if she would take me back or even trust me.",1
107,"""Narcissistic rage"" -- is it really a thing?",8,m5vrax,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/m5vrax/narcissistic_rage_is_it_really_a_thing/,10,1615852989.0,"After recently realizing that experience in my life fits pretty closely to what is perceived to be NPD symptoms, I started googling NPD and related problems and found this concept of ""narcissistic rage"".   


I'm not sure in scientific correctness but the description definitely fits what I've been dealing with.   


**""My"" scenario:**

Basically my NPD-suspect person would get really angry for different trivial things or (more commonly) without stating the exact reason.   


Usually couple of weeks prior to that they just colder, again without explaining any reason, just gradually colder and colder. Attempts to find out what was wrong or offer help only made things worse (I wish they told me that NPD or similar problems exist in school or something, but I'm from shithole anyway).  


Eventually they just go raging.  
 

Their state become uncontrollable, whatever I attempt to say is just met with anger, insults, attempts to hurt me (physically I'm safe, but before I learned that NPD/BPD could be a thing I was just plain destroyed) as much as possible, being really mean, mocking my illnesses, etc.   


No matter what I try to say (and I really don't answer with same, I just curl up and beg them to calm down -- ""NO YOU FU\*KING CALM DOWN, I'M CALM"" is usual answer.   


Maximum rage situation usually ends with me being blocked, driven away, etc.   
This often happens just couple of weeks after they say convince me this will never happen again (or, the first time, just few days after they themselves approached me to watch stuff together, like everything's nice).  


Of course so far they've come back after weeks/months with another ""supply"" I assume.  


But during the rage as if there's no memory of anything good that happened (or could still happen) I'm just powerless to stop them, the only healthy situation when I'd assume such could happen would be when they really HATE me.   


This fits what I read about ""splitting"" and NPD-people allegedly not being able to accept someone as both good and bad at the same time (but I'm not expert and not claiming that it's actual thing common to all NPD, please don't beat me up, I already get enough violence from an NPD-ish person I know).

**Questions:**  


* Is it real? (seems quite common if I read posts about abuse);
* Have you ever experienced it? (Following questions are for the case if you have):
* If you're okay with it could you please help by sharing your point of view -- what is it like? Is it that bad? You really hate the person and do not recall anything positive about them? Or is it just a ""tactics"" to get rid of unusable ""supply"" sooner?
* Can something be done to calm such person down if the rage has already been triggered (I believe nothing can be done to prevent it as there is never a definite answer what exactly causes it anyway, could be a thing which was normal just 2 days prior). 
* Is there some cooldown period after which such person would be able to perceive me as ""not 100% bad"" person? Could something be done to accelerate it.   
Or should I assume they ""hate"" me only when they find no use for me but when they're desperate for whatever I can give them they would pretend they forget their hatred/sincerely forget about their hatered?  


Sorry for such questions, I'm just frightened of the situation and would like to know as much as possible of the point of view of someone who could've experienced it because articles like ""Run, they'll kill you"" are not incorrect but not too helpful if I cannot/don't want to run yet.  


Thank you.",8

“Hey so we are old close friends and we have always trusted and loved each other, so I wanted to cautiously reach out. What I am about to say might sting. I want to be clear I am not accusing you or trying to hurt you.

there is a small chance that you might have subconsciously been using my excessive second chances to ditching, as a drug. I am only letting you know so you can explore this possibility with your therapist, someone who is far more educated than I. 

You might feel angry or defensive about this, it is ok too. I would feel the same way. I will never appreciate how hurtful this must be to hear. I dropped a heavy bombshell and, to be fair to myself, I don’t know how best to say it. Please be kind to yourself, my perception of you hasn’t changed. I do still really do enjoy your company and always will. You are not mean or anything in person and I really do get excited when we make plans. Know that I can be also be wrong about this. Just something to bring up with your therapist. Please above all don’t feel guilty. If you tell me anything know I will keep it private.”

At first I felt like shit. And a victim. I told my other friends and made them talk to him for me. He never responded to them.

I told my therapist about it, mostly out of anger but we worked at his text. The therapist helped me recognize some truths about myself by bringing up other romantic relationships I had in the past. 

We also acknowledged that I was intentionally triggering his ptsd abandonment anxiety to make him cling onto me for support.

A few days ago I was diagnosed with NPD. I don’t know how to feel. I feel guilty and angry. I don’t like being labeled as narcissist. I hate how my parents(who are shitty in general) look at me. I am now getting additional help. 

I want to improve and get this stain off. I want to run back to my friend and tell him how sorry I am and hope he accepts me.

109,Do I sound like a narcissist??,13,llnjbb,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/llnjbb/do_i_sound_like_a_narcissist/,14,1613541755.0,"
I’ve been really worried lately that I am a narcissist (I have already been diagnosed with BPD for years). I have talked to my therapist about it multiple times and she told me that I am not a narcissist, rather I might have a more “narcissistic type of BPD”. That makes sense to me, but I am curious if I have both NPD and BPD. The reason I think I’m a narcissist is because I want everybody to like me so badly and I always feel rejected bc I read into peoples behaviors too much which makes me feel either really suicidal or really angry. After every interaction I have with somebody I start to think of all the things that I said and that they probably think I’m weird or awkward. I always worry that somehow I offended people, even though rationally I know I was given no reason to think that. I always play interactions over and over again in my head and think things like “oh I should have talked to that customer longer” or “I should have hd the courage to tell that person i like their shirt” and stuff like that. I just think somehow me not doing those things was offensive. I don’t know if that makes sense. When it comes to coworkers and stuff I really want them to like me but constantly feel rejected for no reason. I also feel like I need everybody to know everything about me. If I start talking about something personal, I want to explain it in full detail so that I’m not misunderstood and therefore invalidated. I constantly think about the past and fluctuate between extreme guilt and extreme anger when thinking about certain people or situations. I do have a lot of trauma and bad experience with relationships. Although the people in those relationships were not good to me, I know it doesn’t excuse my actions. For example, my one ex who was actually a covert narc would tell me she’d kill herself if I left but that doesn’t excuse the fact I stayed even though I didn’t want to. I hurt her and I feel bad. I also feel like because my emotions are so big, they suffocate the people around me. My BPD meltdowns are so frequent and out of control, I am blind to others peoples thoughts and feelings during them and after I want to die out of guilt. I take everything personally and I know that’s wrong and I need to change that. For example, if my girlfriend says another girl is pretty, I’ll interpret that as “she thinks I’m ugly” or “she wants to be with her not me”. This is actually strange because this is not something I experienced since my BPD was at it’s worst. I wonder if my experience with my previously mentioned ex changed that, since that relationship made me lose two years of therapeutic progress. Complete relapse in symptoms. Idk I hate who I’ve become. In 2019, I was so well managed, I was able to use my DBT skills, I was able to balance areas of my life. Now, I don’t know what to do. I’m a bad person and all of my illnesses are acting up. I need to get better for my family and my girlfriend and my friends. I keep fighting to keep them happy. I cannot be narcissistic, it’s not fair to them. Please help me find a way to adjust these behaviors. Sorry for the long rant. Thank you.",13
110,Does anyone find the idea of “self hatred” extremely unrelatable?,1,mg7xl7,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/mg7xl7/does_anyone_find_the_idea_of_self_hatred/,16,1617078750.0,"I see so many folks around me who feel guilt, sadness over what they’ve done if they deemed it immoral, hatred at themselves for whom/what they are, and these people feel it enough for it to be a regular emotion. And it’s like.. most people who do this. I feel like an alien because I’ve never felt self hatred in my life. If I fuck up, I always just take it easy because narcissism won’t ever let me feel bad about myself. Hell, I’ve even violated my own (unstable) morals but I didn’t feel bad about it. Even tracing my memories back since forever, I can only recall retaliation and anger against others who dared to criticize any of my flaws rather than ever being upset I had any negative traits, even if I was fully responsible for them. 

This isn’t to say I have zero negative emotions, but these types of (abstract?) emotions like guilt are so far and few in between- and self hatred is nonexistent. Thankfully, the only struggle that this brings me is that I don’t know how to deal with it when my friends/family experience these emotions, and I usually need assistance. Otherwise I’m navigating blind.

I love him but I’m at a cross roads.,5,m0nhti,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/m0nhti/can_anyone_help_me_understand_my_boyfriend_he/,12,1615230994.0,"( 25 f )I’m going to make this as short as possible : I am an empath for sure I would say ironically like I’m a nice girl with for sure mental health issues like I suffered from anorexia , depression and anxiety. I had a long relationship before he treated me well but we just both wanted different things so it ended mutually. Good relationship I never cried or hated my life during that time. With that being said I have an understanding of a healthy relationship. 

I have been suffering for a while now so : feelings ?  Never and my feelings do not matter and I don’t even need much if I’m being honest. But this dude is like a robot and I asked him why he loved me and he said “ your generous and I am easy to talk to”. At first it was good and he did love bomb me but not as much it was as I read about. The feelings and no empathy I saw very quickly. 

Which brings me to anger : he has lashed out multiple times over the smallest things. A good example of no empathy mixed with anger : I told him I wanted just a little note anything to make me feel appreciated and one time he told me he wrote me a note and than hid it in my apartment and I went searching for it everywhere all for him to say he didn’t actually write me one but he was joking and when I cried because he knew how much that would have meant to me he got so angry and screamed at me and I didn’t know him anymore. I sobbed so much he ended up saying sorry but still justified his actions saying it was just a joke and I am way to sensitive.  That is a really good example and if needed I can give a ton more that slowly chipped away at me and broke me down. 

I’m a loving sweet girl straight up not perfect I have issues but I always leave him sweet notes and cute shit and I’ve been told he doesn’t need them and doesn’t care. When I bring up the anger and lack of empathy and he lashes out at me only starting this cycle of saying sorry than doing something nice for me until the next time he gets angry and does something nice to fuck with my head.

Space : going days with out talking to me and calling me crazy for calling him out for it. I once surprised him with dinner and he said I only did it so I would guilt him into coming over. Wtf

Break up #1 : came over “ future faked” told me flowers everyday oh the false promises haha and nothing ever happened. Promised therapy and that didn’t happen. 

I kept going but the lack of any attention and care broke me down I give and give and he takes. I must have more issues to fix also because he continues to tell me he doesn’t care anymore because I’m “ always starting fights” but I just have to try and stand up for myself but every time it gets twisted back at me. 

Break up #2 : I even got told when he pushed me to be angry “ do you even remember what you said 5 minutes ago” and he told his mom I was abusive which is a joke. I just tried to express I couldn’t do this anymore because I was tired of trying and he knew what I needed and I stuck around for all this emotional abuse in hopes he would change. This time was awful he twisted the whole thing on me he was so good at manipulating me I ended up apologizing for breaking up with him how the hell? That it was my personal issues that brought on the second break up. Insane I have no clue how he did it. Like I said I have my own issues to which I’ll own up to and I get therapy for but when this shit started happening I started to think I was less fucked up than I thought. 

I love him very much when I say I’m less fucked up than I thought I am not trying to be so mean but I’m so angry that I have allowed myself to be treated like this and making myself think maybe I’m a little borderline because all my friends see how awful I am treated and how sad I am but I choose to stay because I see the good times. I really don’t know but I try to be self aware and I go to therapy every week. Very high highs and very low lows in this relationship 

It’s gotten so bad as to anytime he uses a certain tone I get scared or anxious and I’m scared to leave because of what he will say to me or do. Sometimes I wish the abuse was physical so someone could see what’s happening and also because those scars seem to heal but this has fucked me up forever.

He is a average looking person lol and I would say I’m pretty for him to not ironically sound narcissistic but I prefer the dad bod and he drinks more than he works out. After all I’m at athlete with an eating disorder so someone ripped just doesn’t do it for me need the balance of you will. But he thinks he’s perfect umm he’s super messy but he is obsessed with being the best at work. Won’t shut up about his old fraternity days and how good he is at work. 

- rough childhood is an understatement abusive environment and has told me he has no issues at all he’s totally fine so he doesn’t need therapy .  
- Or god I’m a Christian and he said he doesn’t need anyone else but himself ( no religious commentary plz just pointing that out  ) 
- started to convince me I’m to needy or to much 

I also reached out to his ex and we are now friends and turns out he abused her way worse than me. She’s been my rock through this but I honestly just reached out to her because I felt like I couldn’t have been the first girl who went through this. 

And I still hope for better what is wrong with me.  After all this I still care for him or I’m trauma bonded I don’t know. 

I can’t say how many times I just need simple things from him that he hasn’t given me but I’m doing the best I can knowing his childhood and I try to be patient because I love him. 

Anyways is he a narcissist are these red flags and should I leave ?",5

It would be good to change but i have given up, my desire for abuse and power is so pathological that it is a force no longer tangible or to be reckoned with. The only thing that could help is if i got a lifetime supply of compliments and love from others, that would compensate me, but because this is not possible, i take these extreme measures in society such as hurt and abuse people. I never put my hands on others, it is purely mental such as lovebombing, gaslighting, having arguments, making someone feel insecure, etc.

I will never forgive the Facebook groups (BPD groups, dating groups, music groups) and the way many women and young men treated me online.

What should i do?,17,kpdxpe,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/kpdxpe/i_cant_get_my_victim_to_believe_i_have_strong_npd/,15,1609649252.0,"I was in a situation where I led someone on, gave out mixed signals, and moved on like it was nothing. Said things that shouldn’t have been said if no real relationship was going to happen. A common love bombing and discarding scenario. 

This happened the summer of 2019, and I didn't get to truly apologizing and admitting what happened until May of 2020. Between that time, I often times ignored and heavily deflected, yet she said she at least wanted a friendship if I can't do a relationship. When I got to realizing my mistake and apologized, I agreed to be friends with her. I genuinely wanted to get to know her more. I was hesitant at that point, not because I wanted to continue ""discarding"" this person, but because of how it is simply hard to have a healthy friendship when my victim still has feelings for me and is still very scarred and angry about what happened. I didn't know at this point that my tendencies were specifically a part of NPD, so I did not know the importance of things like ""no contact."" I just thought of it like, ""isn't it hard to have a healthy friendship after a failed relationship that ended on bad terms?""

So we stayed friends, mind you, since this is a pandemic and I finished school and moved away, it was all online. We had a lot of meaningful moments together that felt genuine, talked on the phone, played games together. I felt closer and genuinely started to regret how I hurt such a great person.

But we often would argue, happening at least once a month, sometimes every two weeks. Since I was the one who hurt her, complicated things, I wanted to try my best and listen and validate her feelings of anger. But often times, it ended up getting escalated into a full blown argument, finding myself deflecting still. So whenever those arguments happened I suggested maybe we shouldn't continue this. I still didn't know I had NPD but it was obvious that she was hurt by staying friends and I had a hard time being able to deal with that. I told her that multiple times but she would say that she would be going through shit regardless if we were friends or not, and accused me of trying to discard her again. And I hated that I had to keep bringing up ""ending it"" every argument because I know that's another tendency of narcissists. I had a father who threatened to walk out on every argument. But I also felt like I wasn't just giving up or trying to discard. It felt genuinely toxic for her.

So about two months ago, I stumbled upon online resources that led me to believe I had NPD. And a month ago, I opened up to her that I might have NPD. She agreed I had tendencies, but didn't think she was still chasing that ""high"" with me whereas she actually chased the ""high"" in her abusive relationship with a past narcissist, and said it was different from that. She agreed that NPD is a spectrum and not black or white, and applauded my efforts of admitting and growing, saying she is still ok with being friends. But a week later another one of those arguments happen and I really have a hard time being able to sit through and listen to her pain. I no longer raise my voice or talk over her, but often it gets escalated to her crying. So I propose ending this but again she thinks I am easily discarding her. She admits its so hard for her to move on because she has abandonment issues and she's had a very lonely life. I tried my best to explain that ending it is best for her, yet because I brought up ending it so many times, she thinks I've been wanting to discard her the whole time. I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I need a long period of time to become a better person but it's so hard when it feels like I continue to make the same mistakes.",17

Everyone I know with NPD who have been around others who encourage self awareness and compassion know this about themselves.  


Some people may just have NPD, some handle a disorder they have badly and it plays into how they choose to abuse people, but lets be honest NPD usually comes with co-morbidities (yes even ADHD and Autism) so on and so fourth.

So someone tell me why the fuck I have to listen to people who haven't met me tell me I'm a monster who should be ashamed of my actions everywhere I go? Why am I the egomaniac when some people can't go a day without telling random people on the internet they're reptile vampires made by satan to inconvenience them specifically?

For example, I shut off the stove between myself and another person cooking and I did it mindlessly. This turned into a 6-hour long argument where they tried to pry out of me that I had somehow deliberately turned the stove off because they wanted to use it immediately after me. I definitely just did it mindlessly because it's a normal thing that I do and I was in a hurry and was not thinking so I turned the stove off when I took my pot off of it. Additionally, when they themselves do something wrong they will look at me and tell me that I ""can't do this"". For example they were boiling water and a bunch of bags of bread that they had beside their pot fell onto the trigger and held it down such that the bags were melting and the pot continued to boil. They looked at me and lectured me about it mean while they were the ones that had made the pot themselves. Another time they looked at me in the living room and told me I'd left a mess on the floor in the kitchen. It was their dogs menstrual blood. I looked at them and told them it was their dogs menstrual blood and they sort of just looked at me blankly. Seems like they were always finding fault for things happening around them in somebody who was around them. It's very strange. Is this psychosis or something deliberate? They definitely have NPD but do they have some other problem that needs to be treated? Trying to find the right support for this person since they are unlikely to seek support themselves.

She started pushing on it to the point where she got upset when I said no. That got me annoyed because in my mind I'm like why can't you just accept my response? You're making a simple situation very difficult for no reason, be vegan yourself but thats not what I want to do. I'd never expect a girl to change anything that she does  just to date me so I do expect the same consideration. 


I do have had a difficult time maintaining a relationship due to me losing interest and it always felt like a chore doing the whole boyfriend thing so I avoid romantic relationships but still have casual sex every now and then. I do know I could never have kids, that whole parenting thing is something I know for a fact I'm not selfless enough for. I politely  avoid  friendships with clingy or emotionally needy or emotionally intense  individuals.

I was enraged because I couldnt see myself as a victim of a crime.

I cried and felt angry even. I knew my partner was right but still. I threw stuff and exited the room to another bathroom. I sat there and thought about how unsafe I felt regarding my 'mother' and how I felt upset about crying/expressing emotion. The main jist is that it's not weak to show emotions...maybe it's just who we choose to trust. Anyways, this the 2nd rage since almost a month ago.

I think the last intense emotion I expressed was sadness and anger while I was in the bathroom, just wanting to be left alone. This was also near the time in which I browsed r/raisedbynarcissists
As of late, I've cared more about people and had a sense of solidarity towards people coexisting. There was a period of time where I tried to work on empathy but that felt worthless but it's for sure not. It's nice to feel like everyone is at least decent to each other.

Im not diagnosed with npd, but i am bpd with narcissistic traits. Ive changed a lot over the past couple years, but thinking back to the turbulent chaotic being I used to be fills me with self hatred. I feel like for the first time in my life Im finally sober, and as painful as that is Im also very grateful to finally be free. I grew up in a broken home with a narcissistic father and and a bipolar mother. their marriage fell apart and there was intense fighting where things would sometimes get physical. I was already a bit of turbulent kid, probably due to genetics but my dysfunctional parents combined with my shitty school life turned me into a disaster. Both me and my sister ended up becoming very toxic individuals, just in different ways. My sister become very emotionally and occasionally physically abusive towards people, especially my mom. I became a very emotionally stunted and angry teenager, and while I rarely ever lashed out at people, I treated my pets incredibly poorly. 

I had would hit my dogs occasionally when they misbehaved, especially my one dog who was very hyperactive and frequently created large messes and chew on my belongings. It was such a bad combination and not a day goes by that I dont hate myself for how I treated her. We werent at all prepared for a dog like her and I was probably the worst to her. It was so bizarre because while I was capable of being a very empathetic person, when my dog would upset me it would all vanish. One day I got so bad I must've had some kind of psychotic meltdown and almost stabbed her. I knew even in the moment that I wouldnt actually do it, but still what a fucking monstrosity I was. I was so messed up and every time I mistreated her I always felt awful afterwards and promised to be better, but I still had moments where my anger would get the better of me and I would yell or hit her. I had also hit my other dog a couple times, though this was mostly as a kid. though even as a teenager I would occasionally take out my frustration on him. I also had a few occasions where I hurt my sister, usually in defense of my mother whom she would abuse but still it was always excessive and completely unnecessary. 


What makes it all so much worse is that every time I did something like this I would always feel so awful, and yet I had almost no control over my emotions. I know now that I had some pretty significant mental issues that had gone untreated, but that will never excuse what I had done. This isn't even all of it, but probably the worst of it. Some things were done just out of not knowing any better, others were not. I hate myself because there are those who have gone through far worse than me and yet have caused much less harm than me. I guess I just soaked up more evil growing up. I was usually surrounded by toxic people and was very impressionable. I also had very little self discipline and control which I think was the biggest contributing factor. There have been some especially bad times where I was with some very gross and malevolent people but I would prefer not to go into that. I'll be honest with you, while Ive improved a lot Im still a pathetic, emotionally stunted and neurotic little child. Im diagnosed with adhd and ocd as well, and there's a decent chance im autistic. As crazy as it sounds, all Ive wanted from the very beginning was to be a lovable, normal and good person. I still want that and Im so scared Im being alone and unlovable. Thats why it hurts so bad because I know I deserve to be alone. Im surrounded by friends who love me but they dont know the real me, and what Ive done. I cant accept their love and affection abd every day I want to just cut them off, but Im too scared to make new friends and Im terrified of further isolation. I've spent most of my adolescence in isolation, avoiding the world and barely talking to people including my own family. I think that intense isolation also did significant damage to me. I was essentially living the covid lifestyle except pre covid, though it was probably much worse than even that.

 Im so screwed up, more screwed up than I could ever convey with my words. I dont know why or how I ended up this way, all I know is just want to be a good and normal person. I treat my dogs and all the people in my life as well as I possibly can, and Im always trying to go out of my way to be a better person. All I want is a chance to change. I have so many mistakes, too many and the shame I feel is insurmountable. Every day Im consumed with self hatred. But perhaps thats a fitting punishment for someone like me. I like to sit with the pain now and try and feel it in its entirety. Its satisfying, in a way. To suffer because of my mistakes. It feels like Im getting what I deserve.  I feel like its through this pain that one day I might feel Im worthy of change and forgiveness. But for now I must live with the pain and regret and soak in it. I dont know, maybe this post is just another desperate cry for attention. Ive always loved attention. Im not sure what the point of this was honestly. I just hope one day I can heal my broken soul. What do you guys think? I have so many problems but a lot of the time I think Im just making it all up and that Im crazy. I feel crazy a lot of the time due to my bpd and ocd so its so hard to tell if Im processing my feelings and shame in the right way. Im constantly second guessing myself and gaslighting myself. Im kind of a paranoid mess. I dont know.  This is mostly just a ramble at this point but if you've read this far, thank you. I appreciate it.",12

If I am interested in a guy or like a guy & he treats me wrong.. I feel like I ignore it easily if I know/believe he has feelings for me. But if I imagine him having feelings for another girl or think he might actually like another girl more.. It makes me really mad. Even though this isn’t a logical reason to be mad except the guy is playing with my feelings- but that still shouldn’t result in anger. Like in my head I want to go up and scream/yell at them in rage insults and call him names. It’s really just out of my own hurt/shame that the guy could like another girl. But I don’t think it’s fair to get angry and want to tear someone down for liking someone else.

I do have adhd which causes issue with emotions but this isn’t a reason I should be upset. I actually score as 4 on the NPD test and as not a narcissist but I for sure have low self esteem to the point where if I never took adhd meds and sat and thought abt my narcissistic mom and how it put negative traits on me.. I feel like id have all the traits.",11

idk how to title this tbh, but bear with me. ive noticed a pattern of thought i always have, which is under mo circumstance would i allow myself to be a “victim” because in my head no matter how fucked up the shit i go through is, how badly someone treats me i HAVE to be tough and take it, i CANT be weak

ive gotten stuck in abusive relationships before, and it was never like “i love them i have to stay” it was more like i stayed to prove to myself that im strong enough to handle this, if i left, if i called it abuse, it would feel like running away, being a weak little bitch, it would mean admitting that this person had power over me which i could never do, so i’d stay and abuse them back to “balance” the power dynamic. this has been so toxic and exhausting for me because i refuse to admit i needed help

ive also gotten sexually assaulted last year and it took MONTHS for me to admit what it was, and still to this day i could never call myself a victim, i refuse to accept the fact that something traumatizing happened to me and that im hurt. only last month i got super drunk and spilled my guts to a male friend, he got very defensive wanted to know the guys name to beat him up, we had a huge argument about it because i refused to tell. because  going to beat up the guy for me would make me feel so weak, it would make everything too real, like admitting someone took my power away, the reality that obviously as a tiny skinny woman i cant take my revenge with my own hands. i got so mad at him for offering me help because i dont want to admit i need help, not from him not from anyone.
does anyone experience a similar thought process? how do you get over it and allow yourself to be vulnerable, to admit that you’re a human and sometimes you need help, that you’re not invincible?",4
129,Am I A Narcissist?,10,l1uv24,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/l1uv24/am_i_a_narcissist/,6,1611219990.0,"
Before I begin to share I would like to preface that I have NOT been diagnosed with NPD nor have ever visited a therapist. 

From the beginning of the start of my own self-awareness - around junior high - I’ve felt as though I am intellectually superior to most others. I am very quick to consider myself a genius, going as far as taking online IQ tests to affirm my self identification. Adding to this superiority is the fact that I’ve had straight A’s my entire life. I also attribute most of my academic setbacks, such as not being in the highest possible classes, due to the stupidity of the rest of my class which forced me to slow down to their level and not be as prepared for high school classes. 

Around this time as well, many people have called me quick to anger and scary at times. They would label me with “anger issues” but every time I look at the events, they were caused by them provoking me.

For the majority of my life I’ve also been pretty mellow. I used to help people with some things but now have gotten to the point where I am just extremely callous and just do not care anymore. Especially since during Covid I’ve only held consistent communication with around 10 people. I am also a very introverted person. I tend not to allow everyone into my life, which makes me feel as though I project a false persona of myself. 

I also exhibit instances of a lack of empathy as well. As I’ve mentioned in the last paragraph, I’ve been recently very callous. But also I have abused others physically and other means I wish not to say. I’m aware of the immorality of such but I don’t know, I guess I just don’t care much. I do feel guilt at times but I just usually downplay it and forget about what I had done. I feel, as well, that I can harm others without much care either, but what fruit would such an action bear? I’m not a sadist so I don’t go out of my way to harm others, however, sometimes I may as a result of frustration with that person. Again, when that does happen, I don’t much care as long as they don’t pull that stupid ass stunt again. Adding to the anger I sometimes feel, I generally get super annoyed at my mother when she tells me to do tasks. Even menial tasks such as getting her water is met with a stark remark and “why can’t you do that yourself?” I sometimes think about this and how I make her feel sometimes because I am quick to yell, but no matter how much I’ve thought it over I am back to becoming upset at her for even speaking to me.

I also feel like I don’t have the ability to love, romantic or familial. I’ve never told my mom I loved her. Don’t really feel a need too either as it is just a word. I DO lust for women, but once I am in a relationship I get bored fairly quickly and wish to move on. However, I do feel as though I have actual love for someone as I am usually infatuated with people I cannot have, but I feel that most others do as well. But I do know that no matter how much and however long I am infatuated, it  would quickly amount to nothing once we are together. I have been labeled a heartbreaker and player by multiple people. I sometimes laugh about what I did and tell myself that they weren’t up to par for my own standards, mostly as justification.

My father has been diagnosed by a therapist as having narcissistic rage, so I will assume that he has NPD in addition. He has been somewhat absent in my life, BUT I do get along with him very well. I used to be extremely fearful of his bouts of anger, which were very bad at times, and now I haven’t angered him for many years now. I generally talk to him about topics that he enjoys himself as well, as he gets visibly upset and annoyed with constant questions or continuing a topic not of his interest. 

For the more notable aspects of narcissism, I do also exhibit those as well. I remember writing in my journal that I wished for the power of Napoleon Bonaparte. I considered myself as his reincarnation because of his dramatic rise to power. It is quite amazing I may add as he had total control over the majority of Europe. And I also think about my future being very successful. I often fantasize of being a billionaire and being wildly famous. I’ve also thought of myself as deserving of a woman such as Kylie Jenner, simply for her status and beauty. I would say that I am above average attractive. I am coy as well sometimes with others and downplay my highest achievements as if they weren’t that great and as if I could do better. I am quiet shy though and don’t have many close friends, less than 5. And I am prone to showing a high ego or confidence sometimes.

This may have been longer than I have intended to write, but I just wanted to share how I feel and not be so closeted mentally about my rationale and feelings. I just don’t want to think I’m such a bad person. And I know I may have listed things that fit every check, but it was not my intention to do so; simply just to share. I am not trying to list anything to prove that I have this disorder or anything, I could care less about having to prove this type of thing to people. I feel like I haven’t harmed anyone, but am I severely narcissistic or have NPD at all?? Am I fucked up? I’m happy to answer any questions or hear any comments.",10

I'm not NPD but I have some pretty overwhelming narcissistic traits.  They only exist in my relationships with romantic partners and specifically only come out when I'm feeling threatened.

I am generally, selfless, empathetic, giving and nice but if I feel another guy is a threat to my security or if I feel I'm being overly criticized by my partner I lose my shit. I will scream and shout, say really abusive things, try to subtly cripple my partners self esteem and generally just dish out a whole heap if narcissistic abuse.

Then I calm down, get mortified by guilt and remorse and the cycle starts again.

If I don't feel an ego bruise/narcissistic injury I'm a really nice guy. Then my ego gets bruised by my partner talking about her ex fondly or saying someone is good looking and all of a sudden I turn into narcy the green eyed monster.

It fucking sucks. I hate that guy.",8

Losing my mind. - VENT,12,g43skb,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/g43skb/im_totally_going_bonkers_losing_my_mind_vent/,14,1587282473.0,"Last year I saw a therapist for three sessions. He told me I have NPD. This opened the gates to hell. I read everything about NPD. It made me not only hopeless but also left me convinced I am a monster. Suicide became real for the first time in my life.

Due to different circumstances, I had to switch therapists. Now I am with someone I have been seeing for almost a year now. And she thinks that I don't have NPD but am more emotionally unstable. But in my head, I believe that I am a narcissistic monster. And I believe that she is not good at spotting the right diagnosis. The covert narcissism that is so hard to spot apparently.

I went to two other therapists to get other opinions. A lot of open style interviews and multiple-choice test later - they all said no personality order at all. It feels like everyone is guessing but I understand mental illness is very hard to classify. Deep down I just want another person to confirm I am a narcissist.

In sessions with my current shrink, I am bringing all this up. Aksing her if there is a possibility to just use therapy for supply. Telling her I have problems with severe self-hate and compulsive lying, lack of discipline, and social isolation (very strong). Lying is so fucking stupid. I lie for things that would not make a difference if I would tell the truth. Meditation helps me a bit to get over this but it will take years if ever to overcome it.

My conviction that I am a narcissist is so high that I view EVERY behavior through the lens of NPD now.

Looking in the mirror - Narcissistic Monster!

Telling my friend about my shitty day - Narcissistic Monster!

Going to therapy - Narcissistic Monster!

Lying - Narcissistic Monster!

Feeling extreme Anger (always keep it inside) - Narcissistic Monster!

etc.

When I first got the diagnosis I reached out to old friends and lovers and ask them if I ever hurt them, how they view me as a person. Especially asking my ex-girlfriend if she ever felt mistreated or manipulated by me. No one had anything bad to say about be. But maybe I am too good of a manipulator. It drives me crazy to question every tiny bit of my reality. How can I know what the true motivations of my behaviors are when I might be deceiving myself with everything.

I reread old recommendation letters and thought about how I behaved as a manager. And mostly I can see withdraw, being terrified about making mistakes, and hoping my workmates like me.  Plus lying! I always lie about my work history because sometimes I am so terrified about making mistakes I am just quitting very well paid jobs in the tech industry. Only to work labor jobs next week.

Additionally, I suspect avoidant PD as well because at 30+ I have very little sexual experience as well because I believe my I am not good enough. Few friends and I prefer to stay in my room.

Sorry for the rant. I needed to get it off my chest. In any case, I am thankful for this sub. I just recently signed up for Reddit and already found your guys' perspectives very helpful.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Hello Community! Thank you for all your perspectives. It is helping immensely. I just wanted to say that it was not my intention at all to do some kind of down-talking of the disorder NPD. Not at all. It is my understanding that it is all a spectrum instead of a clear cut thing. No one chooses to be traumatized. No one chooses to have a disorder. No one chooses to hurt people. A kid does not dream of becoming a socio- or psychopath, either. On the far end of the extreme.  All this goes without saying.  
The reason why I used the word ""monster"" (not a good choice retrospectively) was to clarify how neurotic I felt about the diagnosis. Like when I read about NPD I also read about serial killers that had NPD at some point and thought - This is me. Which is completely delusional. ",12

""My heartfelt thanks for helping me with the move, Victor. Normally you help people out as a sort of ego thing, but I didn't get that impression yesterday. I felt as though you were not motivated by any desire to show off or feel like a good person, but that you genuinely cared about someone. That shows growth, and I am proud of you for that. You still have a long road to travel, but you've taken those very important first steps. I think it's only a matter of time until you mature into a person who cares about others besides yourself.""

I meant this as a positive, uplifting message. I was trying to draw attention to his good points. But he took offense to my message. His reply is as follows.

""Uh... thanks? I spend all day helping you, and this is the response I get? Why do you have to insult me and talk down to me all the time?""

I responded with the following. I admit that I lost my temper here. The anger itself was justified, but the excessive vindictiveness was not. I am not proud of that. 

""I did not insult you. I have never insulted you a single time. I have never done anything but call you out on out on your inauthenticity, maladaptive tendencies, and self-destructive behavior. I have done nothing but attempt to get you to question yourself and your internal motivation for your actions. I criticize you so much because I care about you and want you to be the best version of yourself. That's what friends do. If I did not care about you, I would not criticize.

This is why you and I shall never be friends. You have no self-awareness, no ability to introspect, and you want to be surrounded by yes men rather than true friends that exhibit honesty and guide you down the right path. The fact that you bristle at my criticism, gently worded though it was, proves your true motivations. You never cared about me. You just wanted to look and feel like a good person. A good person which, deep down, you know you will never be.

I take back every good thing I have ever said about you. I was stupid to believe that you could ever change. I was stupid to believe you could ever be a good person. I was stupid to believe in you.

I thank you once again for the help, but it is the last thing I will ever say to you. You've spurned my help time and time again and clearly don't want to be saved from your demons. You are nobody I would ever wish to know as friend. Goodbye.""

Once again, I emphasize that I believe the anger itself was fully justified. Most of my text was perfectly fine. There's only a few parts I would soften up because I feel they hit below the belt unnecessarily.

Im a covert narc so the victim mindset set in and the anger came through. This whole day i felt so numb but some emotions keep coming up but i can feel it being suppressed.

We even over do it in order add some self sacrificing sentiment to it i.e. Trying to finish work early to help, interrupting what we’re doing right now, etc.

yesterday, a friend called and said she could use some money following to something that happened. I immediately thought I'd buy her some groceries for her to last the week. The month even, planning to do it after finishing early from work and surprise her even. 

If you're not NPD, you must be surprised by that last statement. NPDd identify these scenarios on a constant basis, sometimes we create them for ourselves and burst in anger if denied. We select them based on a « attention received/effort to pull » ratio. It's a permanent condition, at least for me. **It's actually the whole crux of having an unhealthy relationship with one's ego.** 

It explains why we want to do things in an out-of-ordinary manner (like above), why we get easily bored (things need to be extraordinary and involve us), or procrastinate (if it takes 8h to deliver that presentation for just a « thank you » from my boss, I'll surely do it last minute). but if you're NPD or have traits, you probably knew all of that.

anyway, I finished work early, told her I'll be there in 5 but with no news from me, she went out til the next day. Which is when I decided to see if I can let go of all the garbage I had in mind.

Today I went over, gave her the amount of money she asked for. Told her to give back when she can and feels comfortable and I went back to work. Lasted a minute.

I think I made progress and even though I came here to brag, I felt I could share with you.

I tried to give myself a different kind of view and posture where I wouldn't get the attention I usually strive for and while I can feel down my brain somewhere the effect of not having gotten  my fix, it is outweighed by the feeling that I actively worked for my recovery.

Just wanted to share. Keep strong people.",64

My score was 104. The questions felt like a summary of my social life. If you’re interested, you can take the quick test here:

https://haplogroup.org/quizzes/maladaptive-covert-narcissism-scale-mcns/

I am not diagnosed with anything yet. However, I am seeing a psychiatrist for my severe anxiety, depression and catastrophic mood swings in a couple weeks.

Anyway, let’s dive in:

There is so much hate, shame, anger and contempt inside me. Sometimes, I fantasize of brutally murdering people because I am terrified of their judgment, or because I am jealous of their accomplishments. I can’t even describe the shame and pain I feel at the slightest hint of disapproval. I feel that those who inflict this kind of misery upon me deserve hell. When someone hurts me, I often smile back at them telling to myself that as soon as I am rich and powerful enough to be above the law, I will make them suffer, and make them regret the day they were born.

At the same time, I exhibit pathological levels of goodness towards others because I desperately want to be liked. I am very hesitant to disagree with people unless I think so little of their status that their opinion doesn’t matter to me.

I help my friends a lot, if only because I want to be liked (and because I like to brag with my high intelligence and make them feel stupid). In truth, I couldn’t care less about them or their issues. They don’t care about me, anyway. I am under no obligation to care about them. They should be worshipping the ground I walk on because I am vastly superior to them.

I put others down in order to feel powerful and gain a sense of control. I enjoy deceiving and manipulating people, even if most of my manipulations are quite basic.

Can you relate to that?

No? Don’t worry. Reading all this shit makes me feel insane, too. I am usually not very honest, not even to myself. I just censored some portions of this post because I find it too terrifying.",12

Basically my mom is in a bad mood. She tells me to get off the communal family room blanket and pulls it even tho she’s not gonna use it. I looked in the groceries she brought home and she said “get out of there” and kinda kept trash talking me and my life. She’s been shaking my head at me just bc I stand up and shakes her head at anything I do. When the dog sits by me she says to the dog “you’re not gonna get any food from her” -basically the way she worded it and her tone showed me she was annoyed bc the dog sat by me and she doesn’t want me to feel like the dog likes me and feel happy. Basically she’s imaging me as evil in her mind and when the dog sits by me it probably bothers her bc than she can’t feel I’m as evil and she can’t think I feel like I’m this horrible human 

The truth is I’ve acted the same way with her. Every once in a while I’m just in such an annoyed mood by her bc I’m pretty sure she’s a narcissist and was abusive  growing up. I feel like she’s expressing she is disturbed  at me and trying show her emotions of anger/hate towards me. 

I don’t want to act like this though. Seeing her act like this makes me realize I’ve done it before. I’ve acted just like her when I’m in a bad mood forward her. I don’t think I have NPD but think I have fleas. What is the cause of me acting like this towards her. Is it a narc flea or a trouble handling emotions, anxiety, could it be adhd? I don’t wanna make someone feel like a dislikeable human and shake my head at rhem just Bc im annoyed at something they did. How can I not be like this? I’m basically trying to get a better understanding of why I do it bc I can’t change if I don’t understand why",5

I am pretty much certain of it, and we are very similar only I am in a much better place with my disorder and behaviours after treatment, and am generally able to have loving and happy relationships although I can make mistakes and fall short and certainly have during our 2 year relationship. 

I struggled to accept that I was narcissistic, emotionally unreasonable and that relationships were near impossible for a long time and that I used to manipulate others to keep them, and to soothe me and then approached it head on because I wanted to be capable of better and have a happier life. 

 My dear partner fits the criteria of NPD, or is at least a narcissist just as I am but is unable to face that he could be even somewhat in the wrong or accept his own shortcomings. He has admitted to struggling with certain control issues, anger and moods, but only in times of great intimacy. He has recently left me after attacking me emotionally very badly seemingly out of nowhere. He can be very controlling and also very hard on himself and I think he on some level feels too ashamed to return but perhaps that’s wishful thinking. 

For us to work he needs treatment or to at least accept his limitations and shortcomings here. But I don’t think he’s ready to do so, and instead wants me to assume culpability and even then is saying he can’t return.  

I don’t want to lose him, I love him dearly and know there is more to him than whatever is causing him to display these behaviours. However if I don’t apologise, and take the full blame for this argument, and allow him to feel safe to return to me, I fear I will lose him forever. I feel deeply connected to him, and saw these traits from the start but not the full extent. 

I guess what I want to ask is if there is any way to help him, without enabling unacceptable behaviour, to make him feel safe without denying anything happened and taking the blame? Or to help him to admit he needs help and isn’t okay? I don’t want him to be without me, or for us to give up on each other as I believe he loves me deeply and wants to be with me deep down and I feel the same.",7

I’m the one who tears people down and is mean. I’m the one who gets angry constantly at them. I sit down and tell my parents every absuive thing they do. I just get so mad and explode. I’ll leave why I think my  mom is a narcissist in the comments.. she says she’s only mean to my as a reaction to me and my own abuse. My whole family is against me and trashes me. It makes me feel like I really am the problem. But my dads head perks up when she walks by and he begins screaming at me and he’s afraid of her. I just can’t tell. Am I overthinking the things she’s done wrong? Have they all been reactions to me and my issues. They all call me a loser and make fun of me and laugh. I literally am mean to them so I get it. They all say I repeat my parents msitakes and that it’s embarrassing to call them abusive.  I was angrier tonight than normal and rambled for an hour abt how unfair my parents are bc I drank alcohol on top of my adhd medication which isn’t a good idea. I’m just so annoyed. I don’t get it. Everyone online says my moms sounds like she has mental health issues but my family acts like I’m crazy and mean. The thing is I am mean to them. I remember rambling mean things to my mom as a kid under my breath. They always pick on me and bully me and others and it’s so annoying. I just can’t stand them anymore. Once I realized they were abusive.. I just feel like everything they do makes me mad bc im so sickened by them. I think my moms gotten narcissistic rage bc when I calmly explained how I’d grown as a person and asked for an apology she went INSANE spewing insults at me and was talking in a creepy voice. She reacts calmly when I’m upset tho and I feel like I was mad in a different way than she is. Like I’m so mad I just need to let it out. I just get confused bc I can’t contain anger towards them anymore. My brother yelled and swore at me for stepping in his room to pet his cat .. he didn’t yell he was just talking cruel and said it’s not my cat to pet which I get but I legit just wanted to pet the cat. And that set me off to start attacking him and my family. But it’s like I feel like they deserve it. Ik it’s wrong and will never result in my parents changing or helping anyone and verbal abuse is never ok no matter what but I pretty much just sit their saying all the mean things they do to me. I did repeatedly call my brother arrogant and an asshole and call him mean and horrible. Idk I just can’t contain it.,3

people just tend to irritate me most of the time especially those closest to me.

edit: also my aunt is a social worker & she always points out how emotionless i am

Im definitely more malignant tho but i just thought more people would understand. because how i see it is most of the time i feel nothing, so i do things that make me feel...well anything.  that combined with the constant feeling of its never enough, would probably most likely just appear to be emotionless?",7
145,Am I a narcissist?,3,jrntml,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/jrntml/am_i_a_narcissist/,12,1605024994.0,"I may be some type of a non-obvious narcissist. Nobody ever had any problems with me, because I’m as quiet as a mouse, but nobody liked me either. Except for 2 friends that I have, and I don’t know how I got them, but we’re not meeting regularly so… we’re not overly close. By that I just wanted to convey that overall people don’t like me, I don’t know why, but it’s not because I’m causing them trouble and pain, as would be the case for a typical narcissist. At first, I thought I can’t be a narcissist, because I don’t have a desire to manipulate people and I don’t particularly like it when I have to lie – in 10% because I don’t like lying to people, in 90% because it’s inconvenient for me and tiring. I have a diagnosed depression so a lot of things is tiring and inconvenient for me, I wouldn’t say that this makes me a narcissist, but listen some more… I do lie when I need to protect myself from the consequences of my unruly actions f.e. I lied that I was in school when I wasn’t there for a week or longer, I forged my mother’s signature to get away with it, and I was doing that for years. I felt really bad at school, I didn’t want to do the boring things, even tho I was not good in class, I never studied and didn’t know anything, but somehow got mediocre or good grades. Don’t ask me how, idk, my school was crazy. I may have some repressed anger issues, because overall I’m very subdued and mellow, and if you knew me, you would not remember who I am most of the time. But I get irritated and I don’t even realize when it happens, like today a teacher asked me to tell her what sign I wrote in my transcription and I didn’t even know there’s anger in my voice when I said “Where’s a sign?!”, because this whole transcription thing is that you have to write a bunch of signs that indicate the pronunciation of a word, so she didn’t specify much what sign she wanted and basically it was crazy that we had to tell her what signs are there, because it was useless and needlessly complicated, and she didn’t specify… Anyways, I wrote about it to show that I seem to be mad for no good reason sometimes, and I don’t even know. I always try to find a way to do things with the least trouble for me, because a lot of things bother me, there are lots of things and people I’m afraid of. Idk how much I really care about others. I wish my friends well and all, and I can be happy for them when they’re more successful than me, but… I’m a void, I don’t know if I care and how much I care… In the past, I never received help or care when I asked for it, so I learned not to ask, and lie to cover up my unruly actions. Really, I lied about lots of stuff, but not to a detriment of somebody else, at least, in my definition. Oh, and I have CPTSD, depression, and Maladaptive Daydreaming. Sorry, for my broken English, btw, if I made any mistakes. My grammar is not good, because I hate grammar xD it’s boring.",3

I never prepare the meal plan for the week. She normally does that and also plans the groceries accordingly. Since she was away for the weekend, on a trip with her girlfriends, I prepared it this week. She wonders why it took me so long to come up with the list and assumes I was procrastinating. I instantly feel like being passive aggressive, telling her politely to fuck off and that she can do it herself if she's going to complain about it. I instead, once again, fight my instinct and justify why she might think that it took me longer than it should have. I felt angered by her comment. I'm not talking about your run of the mill anger. I'm talking about a blinding rage, teeth gritting, soul peering gaze, fist clenching, internal screaming anger. At that exact moment, I wanted to hurt or punish her, not physically but emotionally, because I felt attacked and I wanted her to feel a slight amount of what I just felt. I don't need this oversight. I'm better than this. I can do fine by myself. I don't need anyone. Fuck it. Why am I even trying? Still, I manage once again to suppress my inner thoughts and remain calm. I become numb. Devoid of any emotions whatsoever. Once again as an autistic robot, I calmly tell her that the neighbors dropped by and that we talked for a little while, that I cleaned the contents of the refrigerator, that I cleaned up a little and that I had a look through the pantry to make that we weren't missing anything.

I imagine that this is the type of suppression and bottling up of inner feelings that causes me debilitating fatigue that I feel every so often. All of this emanating from a seemingly benign comment from a loved one that will never know or understand, for better or for worse, how it is to live with this disorder.

He’s very reserved, he doesn’t go out often at all, finds it hard to communicate, finds it hard to even go to work some days, constantly asks why I even like him when in a bad place. I’m not bothered by it and want to still give this relationship a try. 

The thing that is bothering me is that after we started dating a lot of the lies crumbled. When we first started hanging out, sleeping together etc he made out like he doesn’t get up to much and now I find out he was in contact with several girls, sleeping with one a few times as well as me, doing other sexual things with another and I saw another few girls on his phone which he hasn’t admitted to yet. He says he thought I was doing the same and pushed himself to do it.

Having avpd, how is he able to do this. I know that he’s never had a gf, I’m the first and says it’s never gotten this far but I can’t wrap my head around the behaviour he has shown. I’m not an expert but he’s anger, over competitiveness, jealousy, compulsive lying and snap mingling with girls just doesn’t make sense to me. 
I’ve noticed him manipulate me, take advantage of my money and belittle my cptsd by telling me I’m damaged over just a heartbreak and I’m weak (I was in a severe abusive relationship years before meeting him along side child hood issues, he’s the first guy I’ve dated since). I believe he does this because he’s jealous of my ex and views my abuse as not as severe as what he has gone through, I’ll have to admit I know he had it really bad growing up hence his PD. 

I’m starting to think he has npd involved as well, when I bought up his narcissism he lost it at me. 
I don’t doubt he has avpd and says that he does deep down want to get help..

Is there many people with avpd that have also acted this way? 
Or am I being fooled by one disorder to think he has another just to keep me around? 
Is it possible to have both PDs and he just hasn’t become aware of that yet?

But I want to learn to see my faults before I do them.
I am a compulsive liar, I can't really do anything for anyone else but me.
I seem to fabricate memories or just erase those that don't benefit me. I tend to disagree with everyone instinctually.

But with all my lying I did, with all the cheating and manipulating I did, they can't believe me. And worst of all: most often, I fall back into old habits, thereby completely invalidating my ""epiphany"". Rinse and repeat, until the next time I fuck up so hard, and me and my partner have the same discussions over and over again.

I was making good progress with keeping my emotions in check.  Staying honest.  Staying aware, and most importantly, keeping my perception of how my words and actions affect my partner wide open.  

Over the past couple of months, however, I feel as if I have receded back into myself.  It happened gradually, to the point where I didn't even notice it had happened until it was far, far too late.  I have no control over my anger, I have no alarms ringing when I get that kneejerk urge to lie, and I am NOT paying attention to anything other than myself.

I felt like I was doing well.  Felt like I was STILL making progress even when I saw the results of losing my temper.  Still felt wronged, still felt defensive, still felt like I was being unfairly and unreasonably maligned and even with all of that familiarity surrounding me, I couldn't snap out of it.

I don't want to go back.  I don't want my partner afraid of me.  I don't want my partner afraid to talk to me and most of all, I don't want my partner to give up and...I think she has.  I don't blame her...I CAN'T blame her...but that is so hard to look at.  Over the last two or three days I've been forcing myself to do just that but I know that it takes more than rubbing my own nose in my bad decisions to actually make the ocean liner turn.  I think I'm depressed, I've let myself and my home go until I have no choice but to clean it up and I know that my partner is picking up on the times when I'm forcing a smile.

I want to talk about it with her but things are so tender and I'm so afraid of making it worse.

Pretty much in the title. I [F19] have occasionally ended up at the brink of self-harm but have never gone through with it (unless alcohol use counts) because I’m too concerned with my looks. The idea of being stuck with scars for the rest of my life instead of “being pretty” is always enough to make me reconsider, no matter how hard I’ve slammed into rock bottom. At one point I figured maybe I’d exert that anger toward at least carving something pretty and discreet, but I still backed out of it. I briefly translated that energy into tweezing unwanted body hair follicle-by-follicle, so I could vent my rage in a way that beautified me.

Being physically perfect is important to me. I think about it all the time. Being the most beautiful woman in the world is important to me.

158,Curious about NPD,10,ii5jh9,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/ii5jh9/curious_about_npd/,6,1598615028.0,"In recent days I’ve been entertaining the idea that I could have NPD. I’ve not been diagnosed with anything other than ADHD and GAD, and I’ve also only seen my GP and one psychiatrist. I take antidepressants and stimulants, but I’ve have a hard time telling if the antidepressants are working because I have a habit of abusing my stim meds and using alcohol nearly every day. So, to keep this reasonably short, because for reasons that are unknown to me I fear being rejected on reddit for making long unintelligible ramblings. My main concerns are these:

I am in a committed relationship, in which I do feel bored but I also feel that this boredom I feel would occur eventually, no matter who I’m with. That being said, I do truly care about my partner and I believe she’s a very good and sincere person - I just feel this undeniable boredom which I cannot seem to make sense of. It borders on apathy when it comes to how she feels, I sometimes upset her or try to make her concerned for no real reason. I don’t understand why I do it. I often feel angry at myself for it, and regret it, but I have enough insight to understand that it’s a very immature sense of anger and regret and it does not motivate any change, as I have not changed. 

I have constant fantasies and daydreams about power, fame, and being special in some widely recognized way. In my mind, sometimes I’m a movie star, a musician, a game designer, or some well-respected creative type in a niche that no one understands but me. Someone who all the people in my life who never understood me as I am can finally see. As well as this though, I often fantasize about people who victimized me in elementary and high school beating the shit out of me, or humiliating me in some awful way. These fantasies are not remotely pleasurable, it’s more like some twisted rumination but fantasy/daydreams is the best word I have to describe it. Fantasies about power and fame are far more often, but unfortunately for me these grotesque daydreams happen to me too, they can come at any time. 

I really feel that I am special in some way that I can’t yet define, not important, at least not yet, but that somehow in some way my true uniqueness will shine and everyone alive will bask in my greatness. I don’t know where it came from, but I have this notion that I’m a uniquely creative person and that if I just tried harder I could really make some significant change in the world and in the lives of everyone around me. I also know that this is likely not true, and that I am a nobody and will remain that way for all of my life, but some primitive reptilian part of my brain always insists that I am fucking amazing and if I try harder I can become whatever I want to be. 

I want to think that I feel empathy for other people, but I’m not always sure if I do. I try desperately to care for my partner as much as she makes it seem like she cares for me, but I have trouble doing so. She thinks I’m a kind, generous, and good person. I have a great deal of trouble accepting this, and I haven’t, but I put on a mask because she becomes sad when I deny that these traits are in me. 

This post is becoming long, so I’ll leave my main concerns as is. I fear that people will refuse to read, or give me any credit for expressing myself if my post is too long and wordy. I’m not extremely confident in my writing skills. I haven’t used reddit in a while - I deleted it along with other social media’s a while back.

So obviously I can’t ask any of you lot to diagnose me, but can anybody in this sub relate to what I’ve written, or had relatable experiences?",10

It felt like I was dating the best version of myself, I had never experienced anything like it. And he had just gotten out of an abusive relationship himself! We were meant to heal each other...

After a month of dating perfection, one of his social groups informed him that he was no longer welcome in the group due to his “lack of insight” and disrespectful behavior; they were siding with his abusive ex, he explained, who was turning everyone against him. He was not the same person after that, down to the pitch of his voice, I could not understand what I was seeing...

A month later, he was diagnosed with 2 separate STDs.  At this point, I had already seen a lot of behavior that confused me and felt like raging red flags: grandiose statements (“I am invincible”, “everyone here LOVES me, they love what I’m about, except those that one group that just can’t see how fucking great I am!”), didn’t flinch or react after accidentally killing an animal, never asked me anything about me, excuses for everything, zero accountability, etc.

After he was diagnosed with herpes, anything that was left of the sweet boy I grew up with was completely gone. I tried to be supportive, but I was not well, myself; I have cPTSD and began to have frequent episodes of dissociation, traumatic recall, grief, suicidal ideation, and retaumatization. It was crippling for me, especially when he was the source, the trigger; he was trying to learn how not to trigger me, he said, but he never actually did anything to help himself learn, not even a single Google search.

Just around the 4 month mark together (I moved in after 2 weeks), we started to argue, a lot.  I could never understand why our arguments ended up being arguments, or why he seemed to naturally escalate his anger and draw out the fights. I couldn’t keep up with him, but at times he made so little sense I would get lost and thrown off. He would say something and then deny having said it in the same sentence, loudly accuse me of abusive behavior I did not engage in, belittling and berate, invalidate my trauma, bring up things I did weeks ago, sarcasm, etc.  Fighting with him was a nightmare.

I left after seeing his anger only a handful of times, it frightened me and was different from any other anger I’ve experienced. It was not until after I left that I discovered the concept of the “High Conflict Person” and everything made sense.  I now have to assume that his ex, who was arraigned on charges of DV last month, was a victim of a smear campaign and he had actually strangled and beaten her, not the other way around.  

How should I handle this break-up? Even though he caused me and others serious harm, I still have compassion for him. I am afraid of him, I am horrified over what I saw in his rage, but I still have compassion. Any advice is appreciated!!",3
160,Any point in reaching out for mutual closure?,7,jgekj9,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/jgekj9/any_point_in_reaching_out_for_mutual_closure/,3,1603421386.0,"I dated a girl for about 4-5 months who I am essentially certain has covert NPD. I am also fairly sure she was both 1) self aware and 2) was deliberately dropping clues for me to hopefully figure it out, and probably planning to one day tell me directly (until then it was ""I have issues with emotions"" and ""something bad happened to me in my past"" etc).

Now, she never really inflicted overt abuse on me besides some gaslighting and silent treatment, maybe the odd back handed compliment. Mainly I struggled with anger at how she flipped from being so loving and infatuated to being seemingly not bothered.

I have gradually been able to let go of that anger and stop seeing her as some kind of soulless demon but as someone with a mental illness. I know that she has suffered far more mentally for most of her adult life than I ever will. She talked about episodes of severe anxiety and dissociation and my gut is that whatever happened to her in her childhood has left her with a very damaged sense of self. She would always put on such a happy face but I have this gut feeling that she struggles intensely with negative emotions about life and about herself - that saddens me.

So on the one hand I know that there is nothing I can really do to fix or change her even if that's what she wanted (or had wanted), I know I could never risk being with her even if she agreed to try to work on this stuff, but at the same time... She knew the whole time that her love bombing and mirroring was not fully working, I always felt something was off about her and I pushed her away in a way that would have been hurtful to anyone, NPD or otherwise.

I wonder if in this situation it would be helpful to her if I broke no contact and reached out in a non-judgemental way saying that I am fairly sure what her ""emotional problem"" is and that even though I pushed her away it was not because I felt there was anything lesser or wrong about her and that whatever her true self is I really hope it finds peace and happiness because I know that she didn't ask for the difficulties she has had put upon her by life.. and maybe by some horrible individual when she was a child, who knows.

Or should I just mind my own business and leave her be?",7

My mom is very manipulative and emotionally abusing so it makes sense that I would have been upset with her but I sometimes wonder if something else was going on with my emotions. I was always very sensitive as a kid. I remember my moms would take me to the Same shopping store I liked every day in elementary school and middle school. I feel like at the time I was very insecure and felt the need to fit in and clothes was one way I did I guess. I’m not sure why my mom took me to these stores every day I really think it’s over- spoiling a kid. She would always talk about how the neighbors were wrong for buying their kid a toy every day yet she did this. The weird thing is I was very demanding about getting clothes. I wasn’t trying to be manipulative and was very young but I would feel genuine panic until I got things in dressing rooms. I would “attack” and be angry at my mom in these dressing rooms in a very panicked way. I even remember being older in highschool and when I was at grocery stores with my mom I’d follow her around and I would just be mumbling mean things and complaining about her under my breath but there was just so much anger and I’d like be whispering these things to her. When she gaslighted me I would attack her (verbally) back. 

Although she was a manipulative, controlling, and absuive mom I can’t help but wonder why I responded like this. I’m diagnosed with adhd and know I have anxiety/ocd/depression now. I can’t help but wonder if this was all a lack of understanding at the time since I didn’t know I had adhd or understand where I was raised- or if I could have some mood disorder",6

Ive had mental health issues since 12. Anxiety/depression/anger all the bullshit. Fast forward to 16y/o, I start lifting I look okay and girls say I’m hot. This gets to my head and I dwell deeper into self obsession. I would stare all day in the mirror. It’s cringe but I’ve had butterflies in my stomach seeing pictures of myself because of how I saw myself. 

22 now and realize I’m extremely suicidal (all the time) until I I stumbled upon something that made me see the world in a different way but I have to try extremely hard to think this way and my head hurts when I try to change my toxic thoughts and behaviors; it’s like pulling a rubber band.

While my upbringing was not a horror story of physical and sexual abuse, my father was emotionally unavailable and prone to fits of rage.  There was physical abuse, but the more lasting effects...(I think, I'm not a psychologist)...came from the...I suppose 'emotional tyranny' would be a phrase that I'd use here.

I was never good enough, and I've carried that with me into a rather stunted and slapdash adulthood.  I have often talked with my partner about the guilt and shame I feel, but until today I don't think I ever understood the difference.  I came upon a couple of TED talks by Brene Brown and it feels like a revelation.  Too late, I'm afraid, to keep myself from making more bad decisions, but that's why I'm here.

Do any of you feel yourself triggered into narcissistic behaviors by feelings of shame and guilt?  I myself have spent most of my life feeling inadequate, afraid and quick to step back and fade away rather than expose vulnerability and I think that's where...at least where this particular problem is concerned...I'm going wrong before I even begin.  

I've been trying to control my emotions...to strangle them, in fact, because it's felt like the only solution that I can DO to keep my very desperate partner from falling victim to me flying off the handle and pushing them away with anger.  

I do not want to push her away.  

I want to expunge this shame and guilt that I wear around my neck.  She has never made me feel this way, it is not hers to fix, but she's the one who pays for it.  Any empathy I've been able to scrounge together vanishes and it is all about me being RIGHT and not being WEAK.

Brown said the words ""empathy is the antidote of shame"" and it struck me so hard that I've been rolling it around in my mouth and my brain for the past half hour.  

I have a lot of guilt inside of me, tied up with shame and feelings of deserving that guilt and shame, I just don't know what to DO with this information, and it is so frustrating to feel like I have a silver bullet that might just improve my relationship with the person that I love but not have any idea what sort of gun will FIRE that bullet.

Just wondering if any other VNs experience this, supposedly according to this page I read online, VNs may ""erupt into stony contempt (basically pull a face) or a rage over a mild slight, or by extension when their disavowed sense of entitlement is threatened. Mainly the stony contempt part, I have done this a few times after a N injury, and I also get this weird feeling in my chest/self-awareness thing after it happens, like boom I really am I one, like other people can take comments made at them but I cannot. It's this very very real sullen passive aggressiveness/going in a huff thing, followed by moderate anger/blowing up later, like the ""huff"" keeps the injury hidden for a bit but it still needs to be vented out, save for severe shame, anger is the polar to shame after all. Remember that VN is self-enhancement/vanity and subtle attention, any injury goes beyond hurting my feelings and also blocks any subtle form of attention in my mind, so I basically seem to go into a huff at the person who made the comment (other-blame) as a cover up for (self-blame/shame). We are riddled with shame and worthlessness at our core so we cover it up on the outside, hopefully anyway.

I was always very insecure and socially awkward (I am actually diagnosed with severe ADHD and Aspergers) and consequently was bullied a lot.  After high school, I started having all this anger inside of me and narcissistc fantasies, I was angry about the bullying.  Fast forward to now, I am almost 25 and I have not been able to keep jobs.  I have recently graduated college and have just gotten an entry level job and I am very scared I will get butthurt or try to start drama like I have a tendency to do.

I think a lot of my ""bully-ish"" behavior originated in highschool after getting bullied daily by my peers and people I thought were friends.  It like I have this tendency to be ""sarcastic""but it comes off as being a bully, and I can't pick up on people not liking it, especially since most people aren't open with me and are always indrect and beat around the bush.  Then they think I don't care.  I do care.  I don't want to hurt people any more and be a problem.  I get so paranoid now when I feel I have done something wrong and can't seem to see the good in myself when working jobs.   People usually have a tendency to be super rude with me or they try to mirror me and my body language when I am around them. I also would come off as loud and attention seeking and arrogant/haughty.

I know I am going on and could discuss more things about myself but I just wanted to know if anyone can give me advice on how to fix this problem.    Maybe it's not narcissism since I tend to be pretty self critical and blame myself for things.

Say I'm a ""self aware narcissist"", how would I go about improving my self esteem and not get butthurt at situations and people when things don't go my way?  All I have to go off of is self love and object relations.  Also, I feel like I am stuck in the past (highschool) based off of my behaviors.  How do I fix this?",4
167,Is it possible to be happy in solitude as a narcissist?,16,fvhqk0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/fvhqk0/is_it_possible_to_be_happy_in_solitude_as_a/,13,1586108399.0,"Kind of a banter, but hey. Maybe I'll keep you entertained for a while.

Long story short: I'm a M25 with a relatively dark past. I've been diagnosed a year ago with NPD (narcissistic personality disorder). After a year of therapy, I can't help but start to come to a conclusion that there is no way for other people to be happy around me. My general anxiety (and, as a result, being an asshole due to my personality traits that I formed in the childhood/adolescent age) prevents me from maintaining healthy relationships, and after trying to work on myself I can't help but feel like I'm in a loop. Just about any bout of anger can flip me upside down from that chill guy to a controlling, passive-aggressive trash that I am and that I despise, and everything good I've been trying to do is put to dust.

I don't want this loop to continue. A lot of research proves that narcissists never change, and even though I'm trying, it feels like it will just not happen. I want people to be happy, and given that research, it feels like the only way for achieving that other people's happiness available to me is to completely isolate myself from others. To start living a hermit life.

But, here I am thinking - is this even possible, considering we as a species are meant to live with each other? It feels so unnatural to me, but I can't help but think this isolation is the only option. Maybe the other choice would be suicide, but there are too many things that I want to see and experience. Even though that would be just a temporary filler to the void I feel. But again, what are my other options to fill in that void, than trying to live for somebody? Love others, and feel loved by them? But hey, we know it's impossible for somebody like me to achieve. People deserve so much better than me. So, again, I should isolate. For the good of these people.

So, here I am, thankful to myself that I've been working my ass off in the last few years in order to get away from the shithole that was my parents' place. Currently I am able to be completely self-sufficient, at least financial-wise. So now that I've reached this point where I can work 100% from home, away from people, maybe it's time to consider living a hermit life?

What is your take on that, /r/NPD? Have you tried self-isolating for the sake of other people? If you did, what's your experience? Please let me know in the comments. I'm kind of looking for advice how to cope with the loneliness in the long term. Not just the COVID-19 pandemic we're facing right now.",16

I’m 20 years old and I’ve never done anything to fix the issues that I have. In addition to being a narc I’m severely depressed, I’ve got terrible anxiety, and a problem with anger. I lose my shit over the smallest things. Overall I’m just a very cynical person who has never really been able to see the good in things. I may even be bipolar. All these things are inherited from my dad or learned from my time living with him. I’ve tried therapy before but it was years ago, it wasn’t for npd and I didn’t give it enough of a chance before I gave up on it anyway. I’m not sure this is relevant but I started using LSD about a year ago and I believe that it’s helped me to change my perspective somewhat but I’m still stuck in this loop of repeating years old mistakes. I’ve been able to use the substance to look inward and try to figure things out, but for the life of me I *cannot* bring myself to make permanent changes no matter what I learn.

I didn’t have a very good childhood. My dad was a narc and my mom has always spoiled me rotten. I don’t think my stepfather understands me and we really don’t talk about anything besides having very surface level conversations.

I’m only just beginning to think of making real and tangible change because my relationship has fallen apart for the millionth time. My girlfriend kicked me out and I’m staying at my family’s house for now. I’m being given the opportunity to make things right and I know that I need to really get my shit together before I lose her for good. I don’t know what to do for myself or for her. Over the years I’ve treated her terribly whether it was intentional or not. I don’t want to get into it but I’ve made some horrible choices regarding her and I do recognize that I am the problem, even if I don’t realize it in the moment. Time and time again I’ve apologized and tried to put effort into changing my ways but I lose sight of things and it just becomes a horrible cycle.

I want to make things right and learn to cope with the issues I have. I can’t afford therapy at the moment but when I have the money I want to start taking medicine and I want to talk to a counselor or psychiatrist. For now all I can do is ask the opinion of the people here. What can I do to show that all I want is to be the person I know I can be for her? Not just for her but my family too. Everyone around me has suffered horribly because of how I react to things and how I treat them. I want to be a good person and I’ve read so much about what I can do to be better but putting it into practice is so difficult for me. I want to mature and show my family and the girl I love more than anything that I can do things the right way. 

This post is a mess but I have lots of thoughts going through my mind and I’m pretty sleep deprived due to my anxiety over this situation. I don’t know where else to turn for the moment.

Hence now at 30, I am unable to cope with any setbacks, criticism or failures I just bring so much anger and hatred on my self. I have had so many failed relationships throughout my life and upon reflection, I am the problem, I used people for sex, to better myself and sense of self, I made a lot of people unhappy and broke a lot of hearts. I feel terrible when I am alone and this is most likely why I seek out relationships constantly I guess this is me experiencing the ""narcissistic prison"" that encases my mind that everyone speaks of narcissist's suffering with.

""Do they get depressed"" ""Are Narcissists capable of love?""

I'm going to describe my life with this condition and hopefully answer some of these questions for any would-be critics or fear-mongers who just broke up with some asshole and have begun trolling the internet in search of this pop psychology trend/internet conspiracy I'd roughly call ""The Narcissists are the reason for everyone else's romantic problems"".

Be forewarned that this is long-- I'm not posting it on a whim and its been building for a while, so I know its worth saying and not just my ego-feeding impulse here.

Let's get the labels and history out of the way:

I'm a 36-year-old mother with a graduate-level education who was diagnosed with NPD and a co-morbid unspecified mood disorder in 2013 (after my first divorce).  I also grew up struggling with ADD-PI, diagnosed when I was nine years old.   I come from a family of highly neurotic (I mean this literally, in terms of the OCEAN trait Neuroticism on the NEO personality inventory.)but highly intelligent people with mental health issues.  My mom is a well-liked and successful physician who has been diagnosed with HPD and clinical depression.  My father is an attorney who has been financially successful and personally shrewd in our community. He's also nearly lost his license twice, been married five times now in his late fifties, and has been diagnosed with ASPD, ADD-PI, and Bipolar I after being sent to endless marriage counseling and paying for every psychological battery in the book over the years.

My maternal aunt is currently hospitalized for BPD-related issues following a divorce.

So yeah, I was genetically predisposed to this particular set of worldviews, rigid behaviors, and defense mechanisms that make up this monster they call a Cluster B Personality Disorder.  I was highly sensitive and volatile and selfish from my earliest memories. Then events unfolded in such a way during my formative years as to solidify the self-defeating traits.

What sealed the deal for me was when my very immature and self-centered parents split and I got shuffled around among relatives from the age of two until I was seven and finally went to live with my mother for a few years.  Even then I was constantly moved from school to school while mom worked all the time and also ""flipped"" the house she owned every couple of years at most during the real-estate-friendly Clinton years.  I never stayed anywhere long enough to bond with anyone.  I was intense and introverted and learned to be alone with a book, relying on no one and looking at people like cars in traffic.  I was a gifted kid with high test scores, they told me at school.  All I knew in the world was that I was A. smart, and B. on the outside looking in.

I was bullied pretty intensely at two schools in a row in middle school and junior high.  It shaped the way I saw myself, and between that and not a lot of stable parenting or in-depth interaction with anyone, I snapped inside around the age of 13-15. I started taking classes to graduate early and took the ACT, all the while becoming more and more of a constant disciplinary problem.  By the time I got to college at 16/17, I was glibly charming, a compulsive liar, an intellectual snob and callous manipulator. . .with a broken lonely child inside. The SNAP that created and solidified my ""narcissistic core"" went something like this.

""I will NEVER allow myself to be disrespected or humiliated again in my life NO MATTER WHAT.  People are only here to betray and belittle me, but I will teach them respect and build up a place where I will never be small or inferior AGAIN.""

I'll get away from all clinical terms now and use an allegory or rough little Jungian style myth that fits my emotional experience and describes the nuts and bolts of what they call my NPD far better:

Imagine that I was a boy of say 14 in the middle ages-- I go out riding and the neighbors shoot me with arrows every time.  I come home with bleeding open wounds and I try to nurse them but they never heal right.  I am the walking wounded.  I get older and become my father's heir and build up my fortress, because every stiff muscle and lingering scar tissue from over the years reminds me that I should NEVER forget I am the Duke, the Liege Lord-- I can't afford kindness or love.  I'll need to be safe and then feared.  I build my fortress and its walls.  I become a wicked archer and take pride in maiming passer-bys when I walk my walls.  When invading armies come, I'm known for inhuman and savage cruelty.  When allies come, I'm distrustful and cold. . .I make veiled insults and threats and have spies in their camps anyway.

When there is no threat or equal power, I'm known for torturing and maiming poachers and peasant children who break the peace.  I never leave my fortress.  I tried once. . .but I think I saw an assassin with a crossbow in the woods. No one else saw him, but I'm smarter than they are so he couldn't get past ME.  I felt humiliated and filled with rage, so I went back into my castle and torched those woods by night.  Then I torched and nearby village and built a statue of myself on the ashes. So no one could get confused about ME.  All the while my wounds ached and the anger made it worse.  Other people lived differently, I understood. . . but fuck that.  I was the duke, I wasn't like other men. . . lesser men envied me, after all.  Lesser men were foolish and got humiliated and killed for it ALL THE TIME.  Not me.  I was never going out into THEIR world again.

\_\_\_\_

There.  That's been my internal monologue and essential reality my entire adult life until I had some breakthroughs in therapy in the last six months.  Yes, I feel enormous pain beneath my rage, distrust, and bitter jealousy.  For me, the disorder has meant always choosing fear and rage over love by default, because I see threats to my ego safety everywhere.  It routinely costs me jobs, money, relationships, and meaningful human contact in general.  I lie compulsively to make myself look bigger, better, and more interesting-- I don't do it to hurt anyone.  My military campaign and self-importance have always been SO all-consuming that I don't even notice others, except as threats or inconveniences.  In my mind, I'm too busy surviving like a desperado in a world that just doesn't get how extraordinary and important I am.  I don't give a fuck about changing the world or helping anyone, because I'm desperately trying to keep the world from erasing me or exposing my seething wounds.  I'm a cripple hiding in an armored prison that demands blood to feel safe.  In real terms: I had to gossip maliciously about, insult, or use my intellect to embarrass anyone who seemed like a threat.

Can I love?  I can and I do, especially after therapy and as I've gotten older.  I come out of the fortress and speak to people I want to love.  I do it furtively and sometimes only for short periods. I've been shot in the back on one of these excursions, and I retaliated. . .but then I stopped myself before I blinded my attacker or covered him in hot pitch.

""Do I HAVE to do this?"" said a new healthy voice.  ""If I am anyone close to the Duke and General I've created as a defense and persona, why would I NEED to prove it like this? Maybe don't flex this time. See how it feels.""

It took all I had, it ached and frightened me, but I set my ""enemy"" free.  I won't key a car or make fun of your new girlfriend in public, I won't call CPS and tell them lies so they'll investigate you or try to take your children--  I won't dip into my bag of ruthless tricks to salve my wounds.

I feel weak, but the new healthy voice says ""Maybe, just maybe, you're not a little fat girl being pushed off the bus anymore.  Maybe you're an attractive and assertive adult with a career and a life and you're ruining it by being the bully yourself all the time.""

Maybe.  I go back and forth in my beliefs, but I generally try not to act when in the grip of rage or neurotic fear.   I've learned impulse control in DBT, and I apply the tools even when they feel pathetic and counter-intuitive.  When I can't do it, I get honest with my SO or family before I act.  ""I'm feeling angry and jealous right now and I want to put Nair in someone's shampoo."", etc.

I'm still as witty and bitingly sarcastic as ever-- I haven't given up my ranged weapons and defenses by any means.  The difference is in knowing I'm human, being willing to ride out and face someone now and then. . .maybe even tell them ""I'm cranky because I feel like I've been shot at a lot.  I'm pretty scarred up, so sometimes I get carried away.""  Admit your flaws, put down your weapons, laugh at yourself. . .that's my advice to anyone who wants to put a dent in it all.

Reach out to family members who also suffer with mental health issues if you can, but do it without blame or expectations and while working with a therapist.  My brilliant but cluelessly childlike HPD mom has become my best friend in recent years.  Sometimes she's the only person I don't hate, and she is definitely the first person I came to truly love and bond with post-diagnosis in my thirties.  She can't connect with people on a deep level either, she lies compulsively to get attention in her personal life and it used to make me absolutely furious.  Now I just smile and love her through it.  She's a good doctor and we work together (for the same company) today.  I never thought this could happen, but we were both friendless and tired of not knowing why our lives were so empty and fraught with ""misunderstandings"".  She fucked me up with her selfishness.  But she, too, is a broken human whom I have not just forgiven but come to deeply respect.

Don't let anyone vilify or blame you for the journey by using labels and broad moral judgments.  Its a hard enough to break through and challenge false beliefs without this particularly ignorant strain of mental health stigma.",54

I just realized my family is narcissistic and I was the golden child and may have narcissistic tendencies myself. I have completely unrealistic expectations for how my friends and people around me should excuse my bullshit - I’m late to everything, I pay stuff late, I cancel plans, I see it all as normal. I recently got mad at my friend for not spending enough time with me or empathizing with me while she’s engaged and I told her that I was sexually assaulted and that she needed to be there for me more (when I hadn’t even previously disclosed that information). I quickly realized that was a completely self-centered and psychotic thing to say. I immediately felt intense shame and guilt. I honest-to-god felt suicidal. I had messed up. Days later, I had a more empathetic view once I was out of the anger of it, and saw how badly I must have hurt her. I don’t even know what I would do if someone exploded at me like that with such cold indifference.

I told my parents about this, and the suicidal thoughts, and my mom had no emotional reaction. She then casually bought me a book called “outgrowing the pain of child abuse” and I asked her about it and she was like “oh I don’t know, my therapist told me to get it for you, I was depressed when you were growing up and wasn’t there for you” as if it was no big deal.

My world came crashing down. I see it all. I see the way she treats me brother. I see the way my dad orbits around her demands. I see the way she buys me expensive things without asking and has set expectations for me. I see the way I expect special treatment. 

I want to be better. I want to treat my friends better and expect less from people. I feel pain for my brother. I’m very scared and I feel very alone. Does anyone know if I can change? Are there stories of the golden child changing?",23

174,Taking Chances (And why we should),48,ehh223,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/ehh223/taking_chances_and_why_we_should/,8,1577679979.0,"My partner and I talk at length about my narcissism.  It is a topic that (as it should, at the moment) comes up pretty much every day.  It dominates my life, in ways that often anger me, make me sad, and sometimes just tired.

I don't trust my own reactions and emotions.  I have lived my life thinking almost entirely of myself for almost forty years now, and trying to change that most often feels like trying to turn an ocean liner.  Despair hits me at random times, and sometimes panic.  Most of the time I feel as if I am not making any progress at all, and that I am just wearing my partner (whom I care about very much) down to the point of them giving up and when I think too hard about that I inevitably come to the thought of ""well, why wouldn't she?  Why wouldn't anyone?""

I told her today that trying to keep my emotions and reactions and day to day life in a non-narcissistic or at least more conscious way is like putting tape over a crack in a dam and then having to stare at it unblinkingly, unable to look away for even a second in case it starts to give way.  

All because I fear that I will slip back into what I have come to think of as my neutral position; not really being concerned with how she feels or how my actions affect her and therefore being okay with lying and exploding defensively when I am called into question.  My neutral position, naturally, centering all of my concern on myself, to the exclusion of everyone else including my partner, my family and the few friends that I have.  

Today I especially do not feel as if I have made progress.  My goal is to make her feel safe in our relationship and...I have not done that.  For her it is the ever present fear that once things become rocky or difficult, I will disconnect and end the relationship.  I have a long, ugly history of not facing responsibility for the things that I do that hurt others and this is the first time in my life that I have ever tried to do so.  That this is so difficult for me is perhaps the truest testament to my own narcissism.  I've never had to deal with it before, because to do so would be difficult and contradictory to said narcissism.  I don't take responsibility when I hurt people.  I leave them.

This is the first relationship that I have ever honestly considered as one that I want to see through, and she is the first partner that I have ever truly felt is equal to me, even exceeding me in the areas that I find important or worthy.  When I am thinking clearly and calmly and PRESENTLY, it seems so absurd that I would ever seek to end things, but I have.  Many times.

Still, I want to lie.  All the time I feel the urge to lie, whether it be to make myself look better or to cover up a failing or...just because I am a liar.  

Still, I want to get defensive and righteous when my shortcomings are brought to light.  I often think I am most like a cockroach in that respect; when the light flips on I scurry to hide.  

I have come to believe that I have a shortage of empathy, whether that be as a result of my childhood or a physical defect in my brain, I don't know.  That lack of empathy leads me to not care about how my own actions affect those around me.  I can lie and cover up and come and go and wear my mask and still sleep soundly at night.  I am still getting used to being sorry.  

In order to make her feel safe, she has to trust that I will resist those urges.  She has to trust that I DO care about her, that I DO care about how my actions impact her.  She has to trust that I will be her partner in both the good times and the bad.  

How do I go about that?  By taking chances.

Yesterday I felt the urge to lie about a stupid, small thing.  Small enough that not only would I have easily gotten away with it, but it was something she wouldn't have cared about in the first place.  It would have, in my eyes, made me look bad (and we can't have THAT) and so I felt that urge.  Instead of doing that, I told her about it.  Told her about the impulse, tried to explain why it occurred to me to do so, and admitted that I had the thought, whether or not I chose to actually lie (I didn't).  

It was a bit of nothing to her, a very small thing.  Barely a blip in the conversation, but to me it was not.  To me it was a risk.  It is not the first time I have admitted something to her that made me look bad, and every time - no matter how many times I do it - it came with the feeling of stepping out into space without being certain of a place to put my foot.  It came with fear and with a small amount of resentment (at myself) that I would have to do something as venal and beneath me as admit that I am imperfect.  

Now...academically, I knew that it would not cause her to become upset with me.  I knew that she would see it as a good thing, (the actual unprompted admission) and that it would not cause me to lose her.  Still, that trepidation was there and I have a hunch that the very same kneejerk feeling of fear and risktaking comes to a majority of narcissists at the moment of admission.

Most of us here on these boards would consider ourselves seasoned liars, and I am one of those.  I've spent my entire life lying about anything and everything, big and small.  What I do NOT have much experience with is taking responsibility for those lies, and every time I do, or try to because I am not always successful, it is a risk to me.

My partner will not get upset with me if I tell her that I overslept, or decided not to work out, or made a mistake.  I know this because I am a bright boy and also because duh.  She cares for me, loves me, and does not want the clean, sparkling mask that I have worn and presented to everyone else.  What is most telling to me is that I STILL expect her to get upset with me, and that it is still surprising and relieving when she does not.  We've been together for years, now, and it is STILL not something I'm used to.  I may NEVER get used to it.  Now, when I stop and consider her feelings, when I put myself in her shoes and reverse these things, I think to myself ""well of course I wouldn't get upset what a dumb thing to think."" And for me at least, that is the biggest indicator of my stunted empathy.  I have to forcibly put myself in her shoes to consider her reaction clearly.

Every time I have taken those risks it has paid off for me.  Paid off in the only currency that is most valuable to me at this point in my life: my partner's sense of safety in their relationship with me.  

And little by little, her trust.

I have not made great strides since the beginning of my...need to change.  It was only weeks ago that I took a small thing and turned it into one of the darkest moments of our entire relationship.  She says that she sees progress and while I know that is what matters most...I see failure.  I see backsliding.  I see someone who is not doing everything that he can to keep himself on the path.  

It's been a hard day for me...and even that comes with a slimy feeling of ""was it?  Was it really?  You poor fucking baby."" Because I don't trust my own emotions.  I have to question everything with ""is this how you really feel, or is it how you THINK you should feel?""

And it's tiring, but if I STOP asking myself that...then I'm afraid I'll stop trying altogether.  Stop trying, and stop taking risks, and things will matter to me less and less until I finally drive her away along with everything else in my life that I want to keep around.  

The risks are worth it.  It's all worth it.  

She's worth it.  I get so sick of myself and so sick of saying I'm sorry and so sick of feeling handicapped and so sick of not being able to just FEEL that it all gets so heavy sometimes, but I do know that she is worth it.  I hope that I can keep taking those risks.",48
175,Does anybody else here have alexithymia?,6,c05qhs,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/c05qhs/does_anybody_else_here_have_alexithymia/,5,1560432007.0,"So my therapist has pointed out to me that I have what she calls 'alexithymia'. It means that I lack emotions, or that I have a lack of emotional breadth. I agree - my emotions are usually: anger or shame, and if I'm lucky, joy.

Alan Downs says there are five primary emotions: anger, sadness, joy, fear, and shame. So I'm missing out on the sadness and fear.

I lost the ability to cry around the age of 10 or 11, which my therapist says is when I lost the ability to feel sad.  I seem to have mostly disconnected from my fear as well, but I have experienced that from time to time. I am really into sad movies, and have been for many years, like I loved Schindlers list, and other Holocaust and WW2 movies, because they give me a glimpse of that sadness. I have always kind of cherished it. I have a kind of weird joy when I get my heart broken; even through the pain, I am also cherishing the sadness. Only recently did I learn that there was a name for this.

Does anybody else here have a diagnosis of alexithymia, or have experiences like what I'm describing????",6

177,How I became self-aware,67,d4s3v0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/d4s3v0/how_i_became_selfaware/,11,1568588534.0,"Someone in my DMs asked how I became aware of having NPD and the reply is so lengthy that I felt it was a waste that it stayed private, so I'm posting it here in case someone finds it interesting. Feel free to share your own stories of self-awareness too.

It started when one of my exes reacted very defensively once when I  approached him, and I said something along the lines of ""You know,  you're overreacting, I don't mean any harm this time"" and he was like  ""you know, I'm glad you said it like that because I HAVE NEVER, EVER,  NOT ONCE IN MY LIFE, meant to hurt you, DUMBASS"" and it got my gears  spinning a little... Like... This sounds absurd, how is it possible to  feel so hurt by someone who doesn't mean to hurt me? Is that even  possible? Are there people out there who are not out to step on others?  It all sounded foreign to me, I guess I supposed everyone functioned  like me but they weren't aware or sincere.

Then I got into a casual relationship with someone who wasn't that much into me and found myself acting very differently to how I acted with my previous, co-dependent boyfriend. I had always felt like I  couldn't help acting how I did but I managed to actually control myself  around this guy. A few years later I got together with another  co-dependent guy and found myself being extremely possessive and  controlling again even though I wasn't crazy about him. By then I  noticed that the difference was my expectations. When a guy said to love me, I felt like it was his responsibility to make me feel good and  cater to my needs and it felt like betrayal if he didn't. It's also about power, if a guy isn't interested in me I don't have a way to  control him.

When I broke up with my first co-dependent ex for good and managed to  make all my friends angry at me, I moved to a different city to start  anew. I expected to be a blast whenever I went and thought I'd find  company pretty soon but this time it didn't happen. I was very lonely  and spent much of my time on internet boards. I remember a rude comment  along the lines of ""why do you come here to tell us about your life as  if we care"", it stung and made me realize for the first time that I  really talked too much about myself in contexts where it didn't matter  and that I may not be that interesting. I started considering what was  my motivation to act like that and I realized that I was starved for  attention, which was a breakthrough. I had never considered myself an  attention-whore before, I thought of wanting attention as something  shameful, so much that I had erased the mere possibility of me wanting  attention from my mind until then. Then I started recalling other events  from the past that could have been triggered by my need for attention. I  also started thinking about which other aspects of myself I had been  denying due to shame, for example, that I had sabotaged relationships  due to boredom and blamed the other person because I couldn't accept  being the bad guy. I think that I let that internet comment sink in  because I was alone and I had a lot of time to think. If it had happened  face to face I would have probably been to preoccupied about defending  myself to give it a thought.

Then I got involved with a guy who I think had BPD and showed some  behaviors similar to mine. It was very enlightening to be in the other  end of things. For example he'd take my words and twist them to make  them sound as bad as possible. So I was like ""wait, so when my ex  complained that I was twisting his words it was like this? he wasn't  making up excuses and trying to conceal his true, vile intentions?"". I  also was sooo fascinated with him... Only to get bored after a few  weeks. This time I was able to notice that it was my fault, that  something wasn't right with me.

After I broke up with this fellow I was devastated and suicidal, but I  couldn't take my own life even though I was in so much pain... I  prioritized my well-being over my pride for the first time ever, since  now I knew I couldn't escape life and I didn't want to live like this...  I started considering therapy or medication for the first time ever. I  went through 1 psychiatrist and 2 therapists and it didn't go exactly  well. Although the last one made me keep a journal and it helped me  tremendously to discover even more stuff about myself.

A couple years later I got together with my last partner. By that  time I was pretty aware of many of my behaviors but I didn't know what  caused them. The guy was pretty sharp and honest and had firm boundaries  so I couldn't really fool him or myself while I was with him. He just  kept noticing stuff even I wasn't aware of. One day during an argument  he told me I hadn't done anything I could be proud of in the time I had  been with him, and though he later regretted saying it, something inside of me broke . I realized three things: that he didn't admire me and that  made me extremely uncomfortable, that I had felt superior to him all  this time and had expected him to admire me, and that I had no real  achievements to back up my feelings of superiority. I started revisiting  everything I was proud of to notice that I had left nothing behind but a  bunch of unfinished, unsuccessful, and half-assed projects. I revisited  all my friendships and relationships and noticed I had only been  comfortable with people who idealized me and I had shied away from  whoever wasn't immediately impressed. I revisited my past behaviors and  my hopes for the future only to notice it was very unlikely that those  hopes ever became true given my record... I had a huge confidence crisis  and I haven't totally recovered ever since. 

The way I realized I had NPD specifically was really stupid and kind  of embarrassing... Someone in the internet suggested it'd be cool if I  made a review of a particular anime character I happened to share some personality traits with, specifically anger issues. While doing the analysis I found  myself sometimes not being able to put into words properly where the  anger came from, so I started researching anger. Some sources said that  disproportionate anger often came from a place of great vulnerability  and looking back I thought, a lot of the abuse and control I tried to  exert was probably because I was so hypersensitive that I couldn't bear  to live in a world where I could be betrayed or abandoned or feel  insignificant, I just had no tools to deal with it, so I tried to make  people fit into my idea of how the world should work whether it aligned  with reality or not. I accepted being hypersensitive then, although I  had always thought of myself as tough, now it was easier to accept new  truths about myself. Also narcissism came up a lot in articles about  anger, so I started reading about narcissism and went all ""oh crap I  have this"". I sent it to my partner and said ""yup definitely"". It was  kinda like putting together a puzzle when I had all the pieces already. Got  officially diagnosed later.

I think having a lot of alone time helped. I process stuff better  when I'm on my own, if not I'm too preoccupied with protecting my ego. I  think my latest partner enforcing healthy boundaries on me, calling me  out and modeling true emotional strength without the pettiness and  defensiveness helped me a lot too, although it also led to a lot of  conflict. But I only was able to take that feedback because I had done  80% of the work on my own already.",67

I can still dismiss and thus, handle it when people are indifferent to me as I can excuse it to their ignorance and stupidity, but I can't fucking deal when someone likes me but not enough to be madly in love with me. Especially when I've shared intimacy with them. This is the first time something like this has happened because in all other instances people fall in love with me very easily. I've got the looks and I've got the personality, which I specially curate for every individual I meet. It has been a foolproof method until now. 
I can't stop obsessing over this person and I don't know how to deal with it. I know that continuing to pursue them won't be good no matter the result. If they do fall in love with me I'm not going to take the relationship further than a few months because I don't think an actual, genuine romantic connection can be built between us; and if they don't then it's just going to result in irreparable damage to my sense of self and ego which consequently means a lot of rage and anger.

If anybody can shed some light on the matter, even just a little, it’ll be better than sitting this one in the dark on my own:

I would like to preface this post by saying that I understand the fact that I am by no means a professional and cannot tell for sure if I am a narcissist or truly do exhibit narcissistic habits; however I have made sure to study the matter as much as I can to get a good understanding of what I believe to be acting as. For years, I’ve scoured the internet and countless books to look for some sort of explanation as to why I act the way I do and why I feel the way I feel, but nothing has opened my eyes up more than the subject of covert narcissism. I apologize for any misinformation I may share.

All my life, I’d been a rather quiet child. Due to being raised in a household in which I was not nurtured properly in and experiencing sexual exploitation from an older brother at a young age, I’ve found myself to be very withdrawn growing up. Because of this, I would always stick with the kids that were willing to take initiative; people that would be willing to reach out to the damn mute that couldn’t speak up. One friend in particular that stuck by me for years had a manipulative and critical mother herself; she’d take out her frustrations on me and project her own insecurities onto me. She’d criticize me for every little thing I did, whether it be choosing an ugly set of clothes that day or failing to successfully do a handstand. I’d eventually become heavily insecure and hypersensitive to what others thought about me. Since elementary, the girl’s been put into counseling and she’s been doing well for herself. I’m truly glad for her, though I wish I could say the same for me. Not to say I’m not doing well, but I want to be able to stop being so superficial. 

I’d constantly get agitated thinking about what other people might have thought about me. So much so that my paranoia would cause me to keep myself from trying new things or speaking up; I refused to put myself out there no matter what. I kept to myself and a few friends, those of which, I hadn’t gotten the chance to open up to other than on a surface level. I would never admit it then, but in hindsight, I’d always compare myself to them. I’d see them letting everyone in our grade get to know and play with them, be recognized for how great they were. I always scorned at their likability and capabilities in comparison to mine, believing that if I truly got the chance to show myself off that I would be better than them; but I’d always end up cowering away in fear of being noticed for how less I was compared to them. It pained me to feel as if I were superior to them at those times; I didn’t want it to go around that I was an egoist, so to combat my feelings of superiority, I instead put myself down. It would be a constant internal battle between making myself feel like a hidden gem to the world’s worst abomination that didn’t have a place on this earth. I abhorred the thought of me being outed as an egoist, so I would openly put myself down in front of my friends. It would range from little things like my ability to draw to things like my place in friendships or family. Friends would often show overwhelming support and care, but looking at it now, it just seems like a huge ploy to get people to give me positive reaffirmation. To show me that there were people who cared about me. At one point, I tried chalking this behavior up to me being an adolescent at the time, but as friends had felt comfortable enough to open up to me, I realized I am an anomaly. That my feelings are wrong and that I’m a manipulative power freak that thinks I’m better than others. That manipulates and exploits others, not being able to form any genuine bonds with anybody because there’s always some underlying purpose for my actions. (Post-Vent Author’s Note: To clarify, I am not directing this anger and these insults to anybody who is a narcissist or exhibits narcissistic traits, this was pent-up frustration towards my own past actions and behavior. I apologize for any offense I might have caused) Not only would I internally put down those around me, but I would have these daydreams playing out in my head; scenarios ranging from me either being picked out and mentioned especially for my contributions or conversations going well in my favor to me establishing my point of view in an argument or opening up to people about how I truly feel about myself. I never go around to executing these daydreams, but at times, they are what have given me a sense of hope. It’s truly pathetic.

This discovery wouldn’t have hit me as hard if it didn’t affect my personal relationships. When high school first started, I was as every kid was; confused and unprepared. But after a while, everybody seemed to go along with it. They didn’t necessarily understand everything, but they learned how to deal with not understanding. They powered through their insecurities and took initiative to better themselves. They found people that they can trust and stick with. I always stuck around in my own group, but I wasn’t ever able to connect with others. I’d always see friends coupling off with their one close best friend that I’d never have; when I attempted to form a close coupling of my own, I’d always back out or shut my mouth before I could let myself grow any closer emotionally. This has grown to be a habit I can’t drop; even during quarantine, I’ve found myself opening up and trying to stay optimistic, but nevertheless, I still find myself backing away from being able to form steady relatiomships with my peers. A friendship of mine that recently formed from someone willing to reach out and talk to me has been going really well, yet I still can’t find the courage in me to not become blunt or absent at times because the thought of establishing a closer relationship with someone overwhelms me.

Writing all this reminds me of how much of a coward I am, pushing all my blame and regrets ono my past experiences, acknowledging my faults yet not being able to change my ways for the better. Over the past few years, I’ve been trying my best to improve and make up for all the wrong I’ve done in the last. When freshman year first began, I made it a point to become more open with my feelings and outgoing; to let myself loose. And for a while I thought I did, but everything eventually caught up to me because all I really did was evade my own personal problems. Up until the second semester, it kept getting harder and harder to keep up this facade and at this point, I don’t want to deceive anyone further. This self-quarantine isolation time was really what I needed to open my eyes and keep me away from endangering anyone else with my selfish, manipulative behavior. I don’t know what about me is real anymore, I don’t know if the me writing this right now is genuinely coming from me, the child stuck in my body, or if this is coming from the false-self that I’ve developed from exploiting others for so long. I want to be able to be a real person; I want to enjoy life, make strong, close bonds with my friends and family. Hell, I have a little brother and a dog and I can’t help from eluding either of them. I try to keep away from them so as not to harm them anymore emotionally than I already had, but I can’t even grow close with either of them. I hear and see their disappointment in me as a sister and as an owner, but nothing I do is working. I just so desperately want answers and I want to change, but I feel like I’m on my own. Nobody else I know is aware of these feelings, and as of right now, I have no access to any counselors that can guide me through this. So I’n asking somebody, please, lead me in the right direction. Not for me, but for the sake of everybody else I know. For all I know, this could have been some scheme for me to garner other people’s attention and sympathy. I can’t tell if these words are really coming from me, but what I can tell is that I need help. Please.",4
181,"Some DAE questions, i guess",3,gdn0sy,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/gdn0sy/some_dae_questions_i_guess/,4,1588636259.0,"I have BPD with several other mental illnesses and narcissistic traits on top of it all. I mainly struggle with entitlement, extreme sensitivity to and aversion to criticism, feelings of superiority and lack of empathy. But my empathy is weird. I have it, but at the same time in some situations I don’t at all. I try to avoid situations that’ll upset me and make me go into what I’d assume would be “narcissistic rage.” I haven’t been diagnosed, but I do have pretty bad narcissistic traits. So, I was wondering, can anyone relate to any of this:

I lack empathy in some situations. For example, I’m unable to feel happy for others. If someone is engaged, pregnant, in a happy relationship etc I’ll get angry and bitter. I try not to be fake and be all like “oH iM so hAPpY foR yOU!!!” because that’s not the case, but I do respond in a socially acceptable manner that isn’t overly disingenuous. Other examples include certain issues in general everyone seems to get all up in arms about but I shrug off and am confused about why exactly people are so upset about it. However, in other situations, I experience empathy to a very high, inappropriate degree that’s capable of ruining my day or week or whatever because I’ll feel it so strongly. Such examples include loss of a loved one and animal abuse among a few others.

I’m very entitled. This is a tricky one though. I repeatedly thank my parents over the tiniest things (I’ll thank them more than once just for making dinner or I’ll even thank them in passing just in general) and I’ll feel very guilty for receiving presents, especially when I don’t have anything for them in return. On the other hand, in some situations I’m very entitled. I become enraged when others are getting more attention than me. I expect everything to be about me. An example: In high school, there was this awards ceremony type thing. Some people got a few, others only got one. I got one. It was a pretty significant one, but I sat there silently seething over the fact that some people got more than one and was thinking about how I’m entitled to pretty much all the awards, despite some not even applying to me. I knew this was irrational but I was in a bad mood for the rest of the day because of it. On an even more pathetic note, I’ll feel it with social media. Some people manage to get hundreds of likes despite being just an average person I went to school with. I’ll get super pissed about that and will expect hundreds of likes from people too and will tell myself, “Clearly they bought their likes. At least I’m not that pathetic.”
I freak out when I see that someone unfollowed me. Even on Reddit, if I see that a post gets a lot of upvotes or awards, I’ll be angry.

The tiniest disagreement will lead to feelings of rage. Sometimes I struggle to hold back. A few weeks ago, for example, I posted something on social media. Someone said they agree with me but that I shouldn’t say it a certain way. I said something snotty then immediately deleted it before they saw it (but it showed in the chat that a message has been deleted), and I unfriended them. Someone can agree with me but not like the wording and I’ll go into a rage. It’s tiny things like that that set me off. And an actual disagreement? Oh my goodness. I’ll be unable to see straight and will shake from the irrational amount of anger. Actual criticism is the very worst. In the past, I have been guilty of giving the silent treatment to those who have disagreed with me or criticized me. I’ve even ended friendships because of that. It’s not something I’m proud of, but I’d say this is the right place to mention it to see if anyone else relates. I’m also not above blocking people who disagree with me. Yep, I’m one of them. Again, not proud of it, but I feel like this is the place to say it. I always have to have the last word in every argument, or else I’ll never let it go and will have attacks of intense anger when looking back on them, and having what I feel is a “gotcha!” moment by having the last word and refusing to read their response or blocking them altogether is a huge relief to me and that’s the only thing that pacifies the rage. I will admit, it’s the exact equivalent of a child covering their ears and yelling “I’m not listening!!!!”

I feel like a shitty person for all of this, but I was wondering if anyone here could relate at all. In general I’m a good person, and I have plenty of traits that would suggest that maybe I’m not a narcissist, but this is some of the stuff I struggle with. There’s more, but I think this post is long enough. Thanks for reading this far!

Edit: my old therapist would also talk about “rejection sensitive dysphoria” and also brought up the term “fragile narcissism” a few times and they seem to fit me to a T.",3

I had so much opportunities to get help and went to therapy 1-2 times but it always ended with me retreating into my shell and being avoidant, and i just never called them back or answered their calls, i gave up on myself.

I tried to get help at age 19-20 and the same thing happened, i felt misunderstood and angry, now finally at age 21 i have had the far most success, i have attended 3 sessions and am getting a proper psychiatric assessment, i had one at 17, they only mentioned traits as i was still a teenager, but it'll be interesting to see what happens since i am an adult now.

My main presenting problems are: Anger, Impulsivity, Self harm, Emotional dysregulation, Grandiose fantasies of power and beauty, Preoccupation with manipulation/deception and acquiring Narcissistic supply, Homicidal anger/envy, Arsonist Ideation, self projected hatred, and strong disdain and obsessive hatred towards certain people i see as ''threatening'', (Usually other Cluster B'S), Hostility and thoughts of violence, Idealisation/Devaluation, no sense of self, severe abandonment issues, erotomania.

 Those are my issues and could i get help in those areas?",11

However i have had these traits since i was 17, and have tried to convince 2 psychiatrists that i think i did have NPD but they shrugged it off and said ''we all have traits''. I have a disability and the way i deliver my words can undermine the seriousness of what i am trying to say to people, so i believe the disability might've gotten into the way of me effectively explaining myself.

I meet the criteria for a textbook Overt Narc and Malignant Narcissist, i also score very high on Histrionic personality disorder tests

For as long as i can remember i have been trying to manipulate people, trying to gaslight, trying to get supply, trying to emotionally drain people and have had a preoccupation with making people seem like they are the problem and not me. This is all followed by my extreme fantasies of ideal love, beauty, and outbursts after suffering a Narcissistic injury, i am a very toxic person in relationships. I can never admit wrongdoing and rarely feel remorse or guilt for my behavior, thus making it hard to have a job or a good social life. i been kicked out from every facebook group because i cannot control my anger and i have always idealized bad people including killers. I think i have NPD because my grandfather has NPD/ASPD. i've been in facebook groups with Diagnosed Narcs and they all said i was a narc with BPD. I took a 25 minute online test that measured my personal life and relationships, i scored high enough to be in the clinical NPD range.

Last week i got another psychiatric assessment and this week they interviewed my family, i am waiting on results. They still think NPD is not the case but i am sure i have NPD or BPD. What other conditions can mimic NPD, BPD, and can a disability make it harder to detect it? is it possible that i am very skilled at talking to people and thus they are manipulated to the point they can't see my NPD?  people always tell me i am well spoken and mannered, as well as possessing great etiquette, but these people do not know me on a personal level or see my toxicity unless they date me or live with me",5

&#x200B;

A little context, My ex and I are both nearing 40. as far as I know, she is undiagnosed ut has clear Borderline and NArsasistic traits and behavioral patterns. She's hypersensitive and her knee-jerk reaction to things is to push away. her goto when things get rough is to make threats and accusations. We had a pretty bad breakup over the holidays and have been NC ever since.

I have been doing fine until recently, with all of this CV19 stuff going on. a family member of hers lives in a country that's highly affected and on the news quite a bit. so for the past week, things have been eating at me.

&#x200B;

I've confronted her on her behavior multiple times throughout our relationship. All unacknowledged and unaddressed. If I press a concern or issue, it typically results in her spitting on me.

&#x200B;

Anyways, I see our relationship for what it was and I see her for who she is. I hate that things had to end between us on such shity terms because really, I enjoy her as a person. There are many things about her that I would appreciate as simply being friends. Our issues are definitely around attachment. Relationship expectations that neither of us will meet.  At this point, I've just chalked us up as being incompatible, in terms of being partners. All the hate and anger is on her end.

&#x200B;

So my question is, is it possible to have a platonic or superficial friendship with an ex? Removing all of the conditions and expectations of a relationship? If so, what would be the best way to approach something like this?

&#x200B;

Edit: I have no intention of being in a relationship with her. I'm past that point. But if we end up communicating again. I was thinking this might be something I would propose. That I don't want a relationship but I would love to have her as a friend.",1

Lately I have been feeling more and more depressed (working on getting on meds) but I get down I myself as the self-reinforcing negative thoughts build in my head. 
Last night, I get back from my counselor and I was just feeling in the dumps. I make a few comments that I would classify as “pity” statements.  I was greeted was a “Really? Gonna do the pity party routine now?” For some reason, I switch to my passive aggressive statements “something fine, maybe you should just go call a lawyer then.” 
Shit hits the fan then but after the dust settles, holy shit, how quickly that escalated! I went from throwing the daggers on myself to throwing them on my spouse, when I know (hindsight’s a bitch) that any statements I made were not truthful and totally out of line! 
I’m just shocked at how quickly my thoughts changed from one extreme to the other. 

I really need to be aware when I’m feeling down and have that negative thought process running that it’s better off just not to speak because I don’t need to be asking for pity in my shoes. 

I’m trying to find a new counselor as I don’t think my current one is really helping me any more, just listens and lets me talk. It’s exhausting after a long work day!

I’m a weird case. I don’t have NPD but was raised by a dad with NPD and a very codependent mom, as a kid they built me up for external factors (looks, talents, achievements) and I had very few sincere connections until I left home at 16 and luckily started therapy early - which I think really changed the path I was on. 

Over the years I’ve gotten a lot better at connecting with friends and work colleagues after getting comfortable connecting with my therapist. I’m functional, I’m doing well.

HOWEVER- with romantic relationships it’s like my brain flips a switch and I lose the abilities I’ve learned (to stay present with my feelings, listen, connect) and I either default to:

co dependent thinking (lose total awareness of myself, need to impress, and accommodate constantly) at my own expense 

OR narcissistic thinking where I have an impenetrable superiority complex (which I know logically is a protective mechanism...) and feel like the person should be super grateful and lucky to be with me because I’m amazing and better than them, like “don’t you KNOW who I AM?” and the moment they do anything other than appreciate me I bail on them and write them off as jerks. Usually I try to just leave/end it because if I don’t I know I will get angry and try to destroy their self esteem. I have a lot of anger.

I think it depends on who I am with, which way I default to.

I know I need to work on it in therapy, but I don’t see most ppl how I used to: as pathetic and worse than me/out to take advantage of me. But with dudes I’m interested in, i start seeing them that way based on almost nothing and have so much anger at them. I don’t know how to keep hold of the sense of self I’ve cultivated when I’m with someone. It’s like I default to factory settings and a robot takes over lol.",18
188,Do I have NPD?,8,cu19n3,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/cu19n3/do_i_have_npd/,12,1566497569.0,"First, for some background/context: I'm a late-20s gay male from the US.

Since I was young, I've always loved and needed attention. As a young child, I was unusually precocious and outgoing with adults and would go up and talk to random strangers. I was a favorite of a couple of teachers and I believe I was complimented a lot about how smart, charming, and cute I was.

I've always DESPISED being ignored and/or invisible. As a kid, if someone ignored me, I'd literally pester them until they responded. And now, if someone doesn't respond to my text in a short amount of time, I'll get huffy, even texting them multiple times to pester them, sometimes angrily.

Since I was at least \~ 12-13, I've also always felt this deep-seated need to be perfect and since I'm not, I'm constantly at war with myself and with the world, because it doesn't recognize my ""perfection."" This need for perfection feels like it's coming from some internal parent-like force. If I'm not perfect, my superego tells me that I'm worthless, unlovable, and thus I hate myself. I can only ""refuel"" the feeling of perfection by getting attention and admiration by strangers, which my mind then conveniently warps and twists to fit that image of perfection. (Sam Vaknin's articles on this really resonate with me.)

As a teenager, I had virtually no real-world social life whatsoever for about 4-6 years. My substitute was spending copious and excessive amounts of time on Internet forums for various topics, trying to seem like the smartest person there, getting frustrated and even enraged when I wasn't. I eventually grew to be universally hated on one forum because of my know-it-all and confrontational attitude.

And when my friend told me his IQ was higher than mine at 19, I went into what I feel was a narcissistic rage. I was so uncontrollably angry. But I guess I mostly got over it, at least enough to still had fun on the vacation we went on together.

And therein lies the rub. That need for attention for my intellect have mutated into this insatiable need for attention for my looks, since I've realized I'm good looking in the past 8 years.

I walk down the street of the busy city I live in, expecting attention and getting angry when heads don't turn on the sidewalk. At some level, I realize I'm not a super model. I would peg myself at about a 8.5/10 face-wise (maybe less if you count my acne). I think that's realistic as I am very good looking, but not gorgeous or a movie star.

And that angers, upsets, disappoints, and, hell, panics me to no end, because it means I've FAILED at perfection.

I'll never get the level of attention and admiration as that kind of person. And when I see someone more attractive than me, I often fly into a narcissistic rage.

When I look at myself in the mirror, I'm usually disappointed, continuing to compare myself to the likes of George Clooney, Brad Pitt, and others and inevitably falling short.

I also constantly self-sabotage. I have a business that I could have grown into something fairly big, but instead I'm still a one-man band and am in a lot of debt and can barely afford to live. I just ""skate by"" and am a classic ""failure to launch.""

Finally, I've never ejaculated with another human being, so perhaps I'm technically a virgin, at almost 30, and that's also incredibly depressing. I have severe ED whenever I try to hook up, because I'm so afraid of intimacy/people/judgment.

**So, to sum up, and some other traits:**

\- An insatiable need for attaining perfection and worthlessness when I inevitably don't feel and am not perfect

\- An insatiable need for attention and admiration in public as a reminder that I'm ""beautiful"" and fulfill my delusional fantasy of perfection

\- Defective/nonexistent romantic relationships and sex life. I live in my fantasy world of what could be, refusing and being too scared to disrupt or shatter my fantasy of perfection by actually risking real-world appraisals of my looks and worthiness and the associated rejection

\- Narcissistic rage when I'm told I'm not as handsome (in particular), smart, etc. as I wish I were

\- Constant self-sabotage, not attaining anywhere near my potential, doing things that intentionally and sadistically jeopardize myself--e.g. not going to events that could get me more clients, saying mean, rude, or poorly worded things or giving off bad energy to potential romantic prospects...countless more examples

But I can't accept the diagnosis.  I feel that even if I wanted to be honest with him, or with anyone, about who I am and what I want and *why* I want, I couldn't do it.  Because I don't know who I am.  

I've been watching videos of me as a kid and its plain as day that my dad couldn't let me be myself.  He hated real expression and did his best to stifle me, which makes sense because he has no real expression(besides anger).  So here I am, over a quarter-century old and I'm angry and bitter at the world.  I was never allowed to discover myself or be ok with my emotions.  And now, because of shitty parenting, I've become my dad - a hateful, empty vessel unable to love and unable to let go.  

I'm very upset because he emotionally abused me as a kid and he stunted me.  This amount of damage had to be intentional.  To this day he still feels good by putting me down.  He knows my weaknesses.  He always has.  That's why it was easy for him to program me for failure.  And its too late.  Looking back, even at age two, I see that I didn't feel safe being myself.  My whole personality is built on hiding from the shame I experienced and the fear from being unwanted and unseen.  

I don't think that therapy will help me, unless i lie to my therapist about my progress.  I get my self esteem from being someone i'm not, and its been that way for so long, I don't know who I am.",11

In the past, separation has been a big trigger for me, leading to feelings of despondency, loneliness, anger and eventually withdrawal.  

Perhaps because I'm more prepared (mentally and emotionally) for this particular stretch of separation than I have been in the past, I feel strong.  I feel confident in my ability to control my narcissism and in my ability to prove to my partner that earning her trust is important to me.

And my first thought is to be suspicious of that confidence.  

One of the things I truly hate about NPD is coming to the realization that you cannot trust your own emotions and reactions, and therefore I end up second guessing any extreme emotion that I experience.  Should you feel confident about this?  Should you REALLY?  Does it mean you're taking things for granted, falling asleep at your post?  Is it going to make you even more likely to lose control when emotions run high?

I hate asking myself those questions, they make me feel tired and angry.  I want to just...BE CONFIDENT, BE HAPPY...except I know that just happily going along with the good times means I'm less prepared for the bad, and that means explosion.

My partner pointed out to me not too long ago that I should be planning for the bad with every bit as much gusto as enjoying the good...I guess I'm still learning that.

No amount of ''therapy'' will help or fix this animal i have become. I have missed so many appointments and sabotaged every little shred of betterment. As a result of the public system (Australia), i must attend a few pointless sessions to gain the trust to make sure i will attend CBT, Because it is not about the patient, it is about getting paid$$$.

Last week i was literally just sitting there and explaining my whole pathology and she just had a ''Aww baby'' look on her face. It exhausted me. i got home and went into a fit of rage, i beat myself over exposing myself and oversharing so easily.

i think it is pointless to literally blackmail me by telling me to attend a few sessions before referring me to an actual psychologist.

I have no hope, the same abusive patterns continued in my life after returning home from therapy, particularly towards people online. It did not change anything, deep down i am still seething with rage and i believe nothing will ever help the unique human being i am. I am a serial Narcissist but one with the ability to have empathy. It took years of studying myself to recognize that i am a very rare specimen. I am a pathological liar, i am sadistic in every way, i feel envious all the time, i see everything as a competition in which i need to win, i am highly grandiose. I feed over hurting people and starting drama, i am a bully and i enjoy being a bully. A relationship is a means to an end in which i need to win, it is all about making the other person lose and crumble.

Sometimes i am able to reflect on my behavior and feel slight remorse, but most of the time i just don't care enough to feel any sorrow. I see society as a place that has destroyed me and as a result i am doing my due dilligence by abusing everybody emotionally in a very controlled, articulated, cunning way.

Many times i sigh at a therapist because i feel pissed off they don't appear as knowledgeable as i am when it comes to therapy. People on here keep saying ''get help'' and i have now, but i am just not committed, i am not interested in sitting and taking accountability for being some ''bad person''.

I can't even do DBT, because i would only use DBT as a means to manipulate all of the girls with BPD and low self esteem and use them as my narcissistic supply. I also wouldn't be able to handle listening to other ''losers'' personal stories, i hate most of mankind so how can attending a group setting help?

I feel there is truly nothing to fix, i recognize i need help in some areas but i just do not care enough to actually challenge it. It is all gonna take years of work, that is if no one triggers me in the process, but i am doomed. I guess i'll be another Sam Vaknin who will just be self aware but never do anything about it. Even though my IQ is a disability, I feel so grandiose to the point i believe that i have a ''gene'' like Ted Bundy and that this makes me special, i genuinely believe that i have some inborn psychopathy, this enhances my feelings of superiority and i feel like a silent mastermind. I love dictators, i see them as if they are me, i am also obsessed with women who have NPD. I virtually hate all BPD women and spend most of my time trying to tear them apart.

I am actually capable of improving some of these traits, but they come at the cost of other peoples needs. Some of these needs include: not triggering me, validating all of my suffering and trauma, validating that many times i am right and not wrong, having male role models, easing my defenses by treating me how i wish, and also giving me tips on better emotional regulation, anger resolution, conflict resolution skills, positive thinking.

I forgot to add that reading many triggering things online is set to trigger a full blown episode in me, in which my homocidality is exacerbated, and trigger episodes of cutting myself, as well as tearing up on bed and having thought of overdosing on all of my meds. My mood is generally okay and i do feel empathy for people who may be hurting but this is selective and my brain decides who to turn empathy on for.

I am tired of being dismissed as having ''traits'', i want full recognition of my personality disorders,i feel if i do not get this i do not see myself as moving forward ever, and yes i care about a label more than getting better. It is something that a therapist or redditor will never change.

Zero tolerance of a diagnosed personality disorder... Ok, not nice and we abhor but expect that. Failing to recognise someone as a human being in this context encourages an entitlement to restrict this person's rights. This is followed up with a dose of schadenfreude.

Are we getting to the point that this can be considered hate speech? Personally I feared replying as my Google account is too identifiable. 

There's so much of this material on /r/narcissism/ which is bad enough and I assume within Reddit's rules. YouTube though, that's another story. A story about angry people feeling empowered to publicly speculate about how they'll punish people with a psychological disorder.

Another thing is that I’m obsessive about looking good, I have to have a cute outfit, makeup done, and be thin. If I gain wait it destroys me.  One more thing is that when I start talking to guys, I get needy(?) any time they take long to respond I feel like they don’t like me anymore and I always question how I’m being perceived as by them. But at the same time I get bored/lose interest in them within the first day of talking, and only go for people I feel are attractive for social status. If my friend says a guy I think is cute is ugly I’ll stop likening them because I don’t want people to think I have bad taste.

This need for admiration and attention is unlimited and I am really struggling with limiting myself in that need which is causing a lot of stress pain and anger. I do realize that I also have to play a part in making contacts so it’s not only receiving but also giving but I’m having a lot of resistance in giving in contacts because I feel like other people should come to me first. I also talked with these colleagues about it and shared my struggles and they said that it’s hard for them to help me which they really want to do but they’re not sure how. So I know they have good intentions but deep down I still don’t believe them and think they don’t like me.

This happens every day after which I don’t wanna do any more work because my inner child is saying what the hell does it matter I don’t wanna work nobody likes me and what am I doing here. I should also say that I’m not thrilled about the job because I get lonely behind the computer and I actually wanna work with people although I’m really scared of people I really want to make contact with people and have meaningful relationships.

FYI I’m diagnosed narcissist (covert)/avoidant.",5
197,Am I trying to move from Shy to Overt Narcissism?,4,6lkwra,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/6lkwra/am_i_trying_to_move_from_shy_to_overt_narcissism/,16,1499337216.0,"Hi there. I was wondering if anyone had some thoughts on what I have to say.

I've never been diagnosed with NPD. But I suspect I have it. Only with me it's the 'Vulnerable Narcissism' kind.  I'm sensitive and very lost. I don't think I have much empathy. I suffer. A lot. I would describe my biggest problem as 'not having access to my self, my power, my own emotions'. I feel, most of the time, like this dulled, numb, detached version of myself. There's this ever-present wall between me and other people. When I want to say or do something it goes through some kind of filter and emerges weak and detached. It's hard to explain.

I check most of the the NPD boxes, especially concerning Narc Supply, when I read about it online (what a nightmare that is) especially the characteristics for 'Vulnerable Narcissism'.

Lately I've become obsessed with this idea that I have to break free and possibly reach my real emotions or 'true self' by basically: raging. I want to 'shout myself into existence', destroy my inner-filter/wall. What I'll end up reaching  is not clear, but I am convinced it will take me somewhere new.

I regularly have fantasies about  destroying things in my apartment, smashing my fist through my television, topping over shelves, possible making myself bleed (yes I know this sounds very BPD) and shouting at the top of my lungs: ""IT NEVER STOPS, IT JUST NEVER STOPS!!!"". The sole intent though is to be BRAVE enough unleash all these emotions, and getting to the center of me (I feel permanently outside of myself).  But I can't, im honestly too afraid of what the neighbors might think, and I don't know when I'll be able to stop. But in all honesty it feels like a 'healthy' thing to do.

Living like this, outside of myself, living in depression and 're-actively' (as opposed to actively),  is not some small thing, it's become my life for the last 15 years and I can't take it anymore.

I understand this is trapped energy that wants to be released. But I don't know how to do it, or don't dare to. What will come out is very dark and twisted, perhaps. I'm not crazy about the idea of having people worry sick about me if I end up hospitalized, or that my cat will freak out and feel afraid, or that the neighbors will be scared of me, it's not like I don't care, I just honestly think it would be better for me, and hence  everyone else in the long run, because I feel useless to society right now and also useless to the people that I know care about me. I don't want to live in this empty shell of an existence anymore. This person I've become:unable to love, care, emotionally connect, stuck in my own head.

What I think is this: I think my body/mind is trying to break out of Vulnerable Narcissism and into Classic Narcissism. It is quite possible that I just don't have the balls to be a Classic Narc, and I think this might be applicable to most, if not all Vulnreable Narcs. I read somewhere that Vulnerable Narcs cannot access their own emotions, that they think they have empathy, but they don't and that Classical Narcs are easier to treat. Is it possible that I'm trying to metamorphosise? Does anyone have any thoughts or experiences with this? If you think about it, what I'm saying has some logic to it.

I cannot reiterate the term 'shouting myself into existence' enough. That's the real aim of the rage. I feel detached from myself, and emotionally detached to everyone else too. I think what is trying to come out is the frustration, the pain, the mistrust and anger  I have toward people, I want to exorcise it, I know this might be wishful thinking, but there are moments when every bone in my body is telling me to do this (act out), or maybe I should say, my heart is telling me to do this, but I can't do it.

Here's a list of things that make me think I have NPD:
- Unable to emotionally connect or care about other people, when I do it's shallow.
- hyper-vigilance. Intense feelings of being unsafe in all sorts of environments
- completely obsessed with my own feelings. Utterly absorbed by them, which makes me HIGHLY self-centered, little room for other people thoughts/feelings.
- a 'true self' that doesn't seem to exist. An empty feeling in its place.
- a very large need for confirmation/adoration (adoration is preferable) from others
- sexual addiction, which I believe more and more is about power as opposed to lust. Sex and porn is basically my Narc Supply.
- Massive avoidance-style behavior. I live a bit like a teenager, I've never had a job I really liked (all minimum-wage paying jobs until now) and I'm in my mid-thirties. I avoid real jobs and projects because I'm afraid of looking stupid and being shamed (lots of shame issues).

But anyway, I'm  not hear to convince you I'm a narc. I want to know if others experience something like this, what you think? I know I'd like it if I were to read these words coming from somebody else.

What are your thoughts on my raging/shouting myself into existence? It might be a hissy-fit but it might change my life. I also might add that I experience the same feelings with more positive emotions too at times,  like joy..sometimes I want to shout that 'I'M ALIVE!' and give people hugs. I kid you not (not very Narc-like perhaps).

To those who think raging is not a good idea please tell me why.
Thanks for your words.

198,does this actually count as trauma or is it me just trying to make myself feel special?,13,aotpix,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/aotpix/does_this_actually_count_as_trauma_or_is_it_me/,17,1549729118.0,"I already know that I'm using this post as a pity party for myself, but I figure here is better than to any people IRL and you guys will be able to see through my bullshit more clearly.


For a while I thought that I might've been sexually abused and repressed the memories but I think that's bullshit and just a way of trying to rationalize away my bad behaviours. As well, I've had some scary experiences happen to me, but again they could've been overblown. Just so you get a feel for the type of emotional hypochondriac that I am. I should also mention that no one in real life really cares because they either think I'm lying (because of the constant pity partying) or they think it doesn't justify what I've done to others (which is true). 


However, in reading about NPD, I've noted that it does come from childhood, and I can see it in my personality development, I distinctly remember researching for hours and hours in grade 8 about how to manipulate other people and become the ""most popular,"" and from there spiralling out more and more in the decade+ since. 


So I started thinking more about what had happened in that time period and the only concrete things I actually do definitely remember happening to me is bullying and my parents hitting me/leaving me. 


Still, I worry that I can express things in too general of a way that exaggerates what happened so I'm only going to list concrete things that I remember as clearly as my other memories from that time.


* My mom trapped me in a basement with her and made me memorize the multiplication tables up to 9 which I had been struggling with. Over a period of time that I can't be sure of, she got increasingly angry with me as I failed to get the answer right, yelling and eventually slapping me across the face till I got it right. I tried to leave and asked to leave multiple times.


* My dad used to hit me whenever I did anything wrong. Typically open-hand slaps to the face. A specific incident I recall is the time he slapped me at a dinner party in front of a bunch of family friends. I don't believe I ever saw that group of people again. He hit me until Grade 6 or 7. I remember because the year I came back to school my anger issues had mostly subsided and my bully spread the rumour that I had gone to anger management camp.

* Bullied. I remember one time coming to school with a new jacket and having my bullies jump me and drag me on the gravel for 10-15 minutes. My jacket was ruined after. On a separate occasion on the way home from school the same people jumped me and ripped my shirt off. I never got it back. I think no one really remembers this as bullying because I was very people-pleasing, I remember always smiling and laughing when this happened, because I felt included (I was socially stunted and isolated before then).


* My mom slapped me on a few more occasions, again I can't remember how often. both my parents yelled a lot and didn't pay much attention to me.

* After the physical stuff had died down I remember not seeing my parents much and instead just having my grandparents take care of me for two straight years. I couldn't understand them as they spoke chinese and I was scared of them.

* I was dealing with transgender feelings at the time that I couldn't understand and repressed for a decade (I have transitioned since).

199,Online therapy?,1,gb5vv7,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/gb5vv7/online_therapy/,2,1588285912.0,"After struggling with my anger issues and taking it out on my bf (22m)of 4.5 years, I (21F)looked up how to deal with irrational anger. Came across a YouTube channel (surviving narcissism), after watching many of his videos I realised I may be a narcissist. Potentially covert though I don’t fully understand the types yet. Anyway there’s a link in his videos for Better Hell, an online counselling service which is quite affordable - does anyone know if this could be helpful? I only really discovered this yesterday and I feel like my world is crashing down around me. When we argue I just can’t fathom how he thinks, and why he can’t think the same way as me. I get so angry, snappy, silent treatment. I’ll hold a grudge for days and constantly have a shitty tone. I don’t even realise I’m doing it, even when he points it out to me. It feels hopeless to get help for something I don’t even realise I do - but I want to change for him. I may not understand him at times but I want to save our relationship. I want to become a better person for him, and so that I will be able to raise children in a healthy way (ie as a healthy person). I believed for a long time that I had misophonia, however I am starting to doubt that now that I am looking into narcissism and narcissistic traits.
I should mention that I am currently doing free counselling sessions from work (I work at the NHS). I did some before but when I asked to carry on, willing to pay for it myself, she ignored me (it was by text). That hurt and I’m with a new one now but can’t do sessions due to covid

About a year  ago, I  posted on social media due  to some frustration and anger, I basically said that I hid my true self, or potential, just so I fit in with the ""average"", and then tried to continue playing it off, rambling about more stuff so it's not too obvious of an attack. Now, I regretted it, they didn't do much to me and yet I treat them this way, all because of my narcissism, ego, and insecurity,  I wanted to let them know that I was different for a reason, I was superior, gifted, and that I hid it so I am seemingly normal while implying that they are average. Looking back now, it's pretty cringe, obviously arrogant, and dislikable, I can't exactly erase this from their mind,  and I now  also have this expectation from them where I need  to  walk the talk basically, at the moment, that's not the case, so I  got this guilt going on  that hasn't been resolved yet.",3
201,Understanding my Neurotic Narcissism,19,cnkok8,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/cnkok8/understanding_my_neurotic_narcissism/,4,1565265232.0,"For as long as I can remember I felt like I was “different” than everybody else. I’ve always been sensitive to the words and actions of others, and even the smallest slights would be emotionally triggering. I can remember crying over papers in the first grade because they had “red marks” on them. Isolating myself from other kids. Spending erroneously long amounts of time In the bathroom. Missing a lot of school, and habitually visiting the nurse with complaints of stomach pains and nausea. Rarely was their any stomach aches though, and I was never nauseous, at the time, I didn’t even know what nauseous meant . What I did know was that if I faked it long enough, I’d get to go home. Which was what I really wanted. 

Before I get too far let me preface with this, I’ve never actually been diagnosed with NPD. I was relatively unaware of narcissism as a disorder until recent years. That being said, I’d like to share a brief glimpse into my home life growing up. I was raised in a seemingly normal household, that wasn’t so normal on the inside. My parents were very strict and controlling. My mom was the authoritative figure of the household. She usually did most of the punishing and interrogating where as my father was more passive. This strict upbringing started having a noticeable effect on my behavior once I got into middle school. My parents were very strict about grades, and while in elementary school I did fairly well. But when I got into middle school I struggled. My parents didn’t handle my grades slipping well, and they had a weird approach towards disciplining me. When I’d do well, they’d praise me to everyone, put report cards on the fridge, etc.. but when I did poorly, they would insult me. saying things like  “do you like the seventh grade? Because you’re gonna be repeating it” and “last year you did fine, now your like retarded or something.” It’s sad, but this was kind of what I was used to growing up. My parents were ok as long as I was doing good at life, but the moment I didn’t meet their standards, I’d be given hell for it, sometimes for weeks on end.

This led to me lying my ass off throughout my teenage years. I remember never feeling bad or guilty for it, on the contrary, I started viewing lying as almost necessary for me to have a life. My parents were particular about everything I did, where I was at, and who I was with. Because of that, I constantly had to lie about what I was up to.
They also never made me feel like I could open up (which is probably why I struggle with It today). They rarely validated how I felt and would be quick to tell me if they thought I was being overly sensitive, or they would just tell me to suck it up. I always bottled my emotions until adult hood.  

I could go on and on, but that maybe a post for another day.  Either way, These last five years have been the most eye opening years of my life in terms of understanding. 

In 2014 I got into my first LTR when I was 24. I didn’t date much in college and hadn’t lost my virginity until I was 22. It took me a long time to find a GF that actually reciprocated my interest in them. And when I finally did, she turned out to be a nightmare. Long story short, she was cheating on me and gaslighting me constantly. My gut feeling kept pinging off and after some time, I was finally able put an end to the relationship after 15 months. What I noticed though was not just weird manipulative behaviors in my ex, but in myself. I was incredibly PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE. I can’t emphasis this enough, and I didn’t know why. But everytime she would “hurt” me, I would recluse into this passive aggresive world in my head. I would just sit and think, usually fantasizing about her being up to no good, me catching her in the act, and then dumping her, coming out the other side as some hero of fidelity or something. I would also become super self absorbed in these moments. Choosing to spend excessive time looking at myself in the mirror and thinking about how great I was. And even though I had negative feelings about her, I also had this weird feeling of superiority towards her. I remember telling her once how out of her league I was. How I was so much better looking than her. I also became somewhat emotionally abusive after I found out she’d been cheating. She had kids from a previous relationship that she wasn’t raising. So I’d tell her that she was a horrible mom, that her kids hated her, etc...

I thought after this relationship that my bad behavior could be simply chalked up to stress. I definitely saw a darker side of myself during it and felt much better after it was over.  I Was single for about 1.5 years after that and did the typical “narcissist rebound” of sleeping around/ seeking validation from multiple different partners.

This led to my current relationship of 2 years. My GF Is ironically diagnosed with BPD, and if it wasn’t for her, I don’t think I’d have any idea what a personality disorder was. Our relationship went really well at first, but we started having issues about 6 months in. At which point I was mostly picking fights over petty stuff, and putting her on the defensive. Often times It had no real basis in reality, idk if I suffered a certain degree of trauma from my last relationship, but I would constantly accuse her of things, without any proof. She would say “hi” to a guy, and I’d get mad. I’d see her look at a guy, and I’d get mad. Someone would post something on her Facebook wall, and I’d get mad. It felt constant, even on my end. But my emotions felt like It was justified. I remember telling her “you know I’m sensitive, so why would you talk to these other people? you know it’s gonna bother me.” Seeing that statement now, I can clearly see the ridiculousness in it, but at the time my emotions were so high I couldnt tell up from down. 

I started researching personality disorders when my gf and I started having issues in order to better understand her. Never would I think that this would be an eye opening experience for myself. I’ll never forget stumbling across an article titled “Are you Dealing with a Covert Narcissist?” I didn’t think I had NPD, or any personality disorder for that matter, as I never found the DSM criteria for personality disorders to match me. I have however struggled with anxiety since a teenager and was diagnosed at 18 with generalized anxiety disorder, which I saw a psychologist for about a year for. But when I found this article it was like reality bitch slapped me across the face. It read so true to me, it was sickening...

Some behaviors I noticed in myself included

1.) Secretly believing that I was better than others, but not showing it, or rarely outwardly showing it.

2.) Thinking I should only associate with people of equal intelligence, money, looks, etc.

3.) Highly sensitive to people’s criticism to the point of extreme anger, envy, or jealousy. 

4.) Extreme passive aggressiveness in response to stress stimuli or an emotional trigger. (My anger towards my GF would almost always lead to me not talking to her, sometimes for days at a time)

5.) living in a constant fantasy world in your head. This is a bad one for me. I’m constantly daydreaming about the perfect life, living my “dreams,” becoming famous. Even though I’m in a relationship, I find myself fantasizing about being single, going out like I did in college, and getting all the girls/ having all the girls want me. 

6.) I have a hard time with my relationships. Even though I don’t outwardly express it, in my head I toggle back and fourth between liking and hating my coworkers, family, friends. Mostly for petty reasons, but I never forget if one makes me feel hurt. As I read someone say on here, “you never forget how someone makes you feel.” Yep, me to a T.

7.) these last two I had a really hard time noticing in myself until recently. But I’m much more self absorbed than I probably ever thought, and definitely more than I’d like to admit. I think I’d convinced myself I cared about others for years, but recently I’ve started noticing that my caring usually had some sort of means to an end. Which leads my last one..

8.) I lack empathy, severely. I know I have a certain degree of “learned” empathy depending on the situation. But on the whole, I’m about as unempathtic as they come. 

Some other things are, I can be generally mean at times. I come off mostly quiet and shy, but in my mind, I’m the coolest thing since sliced bread. I walk around with this overwhelming “people just don’t understand me” mentality. And if someone beats me at my game, I play the ultimate victim. Sometimes I feel like I’m so manipulative over petty shit I barely even notice it.

So that’s just a quick glimpse into myself. This is my first time posting here and I really just wanted to get my feelings out and generate conversation. Love to hear some other point of views. Thanks for your replies!",19

I have only tried twice.

After a narc collapse losing my 5yrs baby gf

Found this guy online from this psychologists.one site he seemed fine was $28ph had great reviews. So I get into it with him talk to him for 2 hours initially. Had already wrote him an extensive email that he charged me 2 hours to go over.   
OK so he is talking to me and he asks me how I feel about my ex GF, Im like yeah love her and want her back. Then he is asking if I have any contact with her and yeah Im like we message everyday, he asks me about what she says to me and who initiates the messaging. also asked me if I felt anger towards her and if I had ever got physical with her.

Now I know what he is upto as soon as he started with any of this then I look more at his profile and he is some specialist in domestic violence WTF???

Wow what a waste of money for this maggot.

OK next a woman, cute seemed perky somehow had a more intelligent vibe that the other maggot.

OK so told me to give up on my ex GF, we had been broken up 6 moths already and she claimed that if my ex was talking to me daily then she is bad as she is using me for emotional support.Ok, but then she aske more about my ex like how old is she what does she do, I told her the age and she was all weird about it OK 16yrs younger big shit and started relationship at 18. But she got so weird was asking me all these questions that were trying to work out if the ex was scared and even started asking me (after a pause for cover) if I have access to children putting me on the PEDO WTF.

These people are dirt.

I have also recently found out that this no-contact rule of breakups is not about making the other person miss you and want you back.. it was made up by this scum to trick partners into giving the other person space to move on and have a clean break what the hell?

Would it be possible to work with a therapist just to mildly improve in areas? Why the hell they so alarmist. Like shite yes with my girl we play games like these DDLG games and she friggen loves it, we back together now 3 months and its awesome. But these bedroom games with us consenting adults they would be the first thing any therapist wants to cure.. And also my cheating, I dont see why I would have to give that up? Almost ki9lled me last time losing my GF and Mistress within a month damn these therapists would have me dead within 6 months and would wow destroy a beautiful relationship. IF I listened to any of them then my relationship would have been doomed.

With my GF we also have a dark sence of humor and she likes to conspire with me to non physically hurt people and thats our friggen hobby and its a bonding thing.

When you go to a financial planner they do not think about how everyone can win, they do not take into account the people who may (who certainly will) lose when you win in your trades.

A personal trainer or sports coach they do not have any thought at all about who may be upset at you shining so bright by getting so jacked or slim or winning so much.

204,Attachment disorders and off my chest,2,dqxxr4,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/dqxxr4/attachment_disorders_and_off_my_chest/,5,1572771888.0,"Hi all,

I have self-diagnosed vulnerable/compensatory narcissism (although I would also consider traits of avpd and bpd) and to tell you the truth without giving you my whole life story, my self-esteem isn’t particularly great (like that cliche of “do those with narcissism hate or love themselves”), I’m quite emotionally fragile to virtually anything including insults and prone to bouts of internalised anger, depression, shame, despair, and dissociation, especially as of late. It’s why I thought I was BPD or maybe even CPTSD for a while but hey who knows. I’ve also been feeling very emotionally unstable as of late, probably because most people are really invalidating to me and it’s sort of damaged that image that I want of myself in my own head if that makes sense. I really do think those with ‘milder’ forms of narcissism are unstable and self hating at their core, like it’s a cover up for worthlessness and psychologically fragility. I’m f**cked up. Then again, you know, posting here trying to get concern from others here is probably a bit of an oxymoron but hey, surprise me with advice on what to do if you’ve been there.


I’ve been trying to figure out why I’m like this, and I think at least one of the reasons could be due to attachment issues, which I been reading about online as a possible cause for this. Just wondering what others here feel about that, and if you have attachment issues yourself. For me it’s avoidant attachment but I’m also a sort of counter-dependant to counteract that... Despite having some empathy (my emotions are usually muted but they’re there) I have hard time truly connecting with others and as a result often feel emotionally isolated and lonely a lot, and I’m just not comfortable with close relationships, and envy/resent those who can get close to others, even though I know it’s wrong it’s automatic. 

I’m actually in therapy now for dissociation but because the center I go to only deals with more basic stuff so I’m not gonna get help with this anytime soon, I mean the idea of having this doesn’t sit well with me anyway to hard to even say the word out loud nvm talking about it.

Just wanna know what everyone else here has attachment problems and relates to what I’m saying.

Thanks.",2
205,I don't know how to feel,10,bndwf7,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/bndwf7/i_dont_know_how_to_feel/,8,1557591922.0,"This is probably all over the place but oh well. To start, I have TERRIBLE anxiety and self worth/insecurity issues that somehow tie in with everything else in this post. I have a severe eating disorder so my headspace and how I see myself already isn't the clearest, but this post is all stuff that I can recall further than my other issues so. 

I'm gonna come out and say I'm critical of self diagnosis but think it's helpful in the beginnings of therapy/healing etc. Okay. Anyway.

As long as I can remember I've had these thoughts/feelings in my head that I am better than others. I don't know when it started but I remember, when it began, I thought maybe I only felt that way about strangers/people I disliked etc. But once I noticed it, I realized it was everyone. Including people I legitimately love, like my boyfriend. I'm unable to see myself on the same level as others.

Obviously I saw this as a negative trait so I made attempts to tuck it away in my subconscious, and it became one of those things about myself I tried to ignore. If I had thoughts about how I'm better than someone I'd pretend I didn't have the thought and make myself move on. But it's like ignoring that part only made other stuff worse.

One of the earliest things I can remember is noticing when people found me attractive. Even when I was overweight I consistently had people crushing on me/obsessing over me. Someone I've known since high school has been in love with me just as long, and regularly buys me things or sends me money when she gets paid. Sometimes I feel bad, but sometimes I just ask for things because I know I'll get them. It's always an ego boost when someone likes you but I'm fully aware that I categorize them as ""mine"" after I realize they do. Not in a sense of ""theyre mine and I love them"" just like...they like me and I think that makes them property. I stop seeing them as people once I realize I have that hold on them.

Which was an ENORMOUS issue my junior and senior year of high school as I essentially ran a cult. It was supposed to be ""anime club"" but it was more of a group of about 15-20 underclassmen that just followed me around, bought me stuff, and talked about how amazing I was. My senior year I didn't tell my mother I needed lunch money and had the same guy buy me a rice krispie treat and a juice every day for the entire year (except for Fridays, when he bought an extra whole lunch and gave it to me because I liked pasta Fridays). If he wasn't there the other kids at the table would take turns using their lunch money to buy me food. A couple of them in particular would fight over who got to hold my backpack while we walked around at the mall next door to the high school. I once auctioned off old stuff I had in a club meeting and made $200+, and half of them told me they bought stuff specifically because it was mine. Towards the end of my senior year, two of them tried to assault me (one of them multiple times), and that's when I realized most of them were obsessed with me.

I believe that's probably when I started to hardcore manipulate people, which I've started to notice myself doing. My boyfriend and I are working really hard on our relationship right now so we're trying to tell the other whenever something they do/said etc upsets us/hurts us. When he calls me out on some of the stuff I say/do, and I realize they're manipulative actions...I realize I've done that same thing countless times in our relationship over the past 8 years. All these things come rushing to me and I notice I've...been emotionally manipulating him for a long time. And it's not just him, it's my other close friends and relationships too. I just run people around in circles trying to please me (ex.: telling them they don't need to verbally reassure me, causing a scene when they don't, and making them apologize) and when they upset me I cry and they feel bad. Which means I win.

I'm a good liar, and I feel the need to lie at all junctions, even if its unnecessary. And I drag it on. I called into work yesterday and said I had to drive to Chicago, and then saw coworkers later that night. They didn't ask before I supplied my excuse, and I told it as soon as I got the chance. I wanted it known, I wanted to tell people. And I did it like 4 times.

I ignore other people's accomplishments so they can't be deemed as better than me. If someone talks about their talents I dismiss them or act like it's not that big a deal. I knew a girl obsessed with me, but also thinner than me, so I moved in with her and fed off her constant praise and copycatting. Her boyfriend ended up having a crush on me and would buy her clothes and I would always put them on and listen to her, her boyfriend, and their girlfriend fawn over how beautiful I looked. That was a particularly rough couple months.

Last year I lost 70 pounds because of my eating disorder, and I've definitely noticed all of it spiking since. I can catch myself cutting my boyfriend down and stop it. But when I catch myself cutting anyone else down I can't. Last night my bf and his aunt were discussing his cousin and all I could think was how much I hated hearing it. I wanted to cover my ears because their voices sounded so fucking annoying going on about how pretty she was, how she got everything, and how jealous they were. I felt so clouded, it was weird. I had these thoughts streamlining through my head like ""im sitting right in front of you so you how can you even complain people would kill to sit next to me and im just letting you"" etc and they were some of the darker thoughts I've had in a while. I couldn't control where my mind was going and it only stopped when the play we were watching started (I also partially disliked going to the play bc my bf's other cousin wrote/directed it and again I hate acknowledging other people's accomplishments so).

So I guess the reason I'm bringing all this up is I recently lost my grandmother. She quite literally saved my life, and was arguably the most important person to me. The time shortly after she died I spewed forth every thought that came out of my head because I was numb, being mean already because I was grieving, and I felt like I was in a cloud similar to last night. Some of the stuff I said...disturbed my boyfriend. When I picked up on that, I started keeping my mouth shut again. But the thoughts, the ""I'm better than everyone else"", they've just gotten worse. I've always suspected my brother of being a narcissist, as he abused me for years and I saw parts of him no one else saw before. I've always known I had bad anger issues like him, but I've always been able to control it (not punch things etc) better than him. When I started to notice all these traits, I would think, ""at least I'm not as bad as [brother]."" That sort of justified things for me I guess.

Because my boyfriend and I are working on our relationship more, we're trying to work on ourselves more, so we're both planning on therapy. I don't...know what a therapist would think of me saying all of this. Like I said I have terrible anxiety especially about how people see me, and every therapist I've had in the past I've put on the same front I put on for everyone. I've never told a professional about these feelings and don't know if they're worth it. I could just as easily be blowing all of this out of proportion.",10

208,Friction and frustration with therapists (long vent and some questions),9,9c5bn0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/9c5bn0/friction_and_frustration_with_therapists_long/,22,1535826324.0,"**Therapist 1:**

I go because I was depressed and had tried to take my own life. The truth is that I went expecting that it wouldn't help me, but I wanted to look like I was trying to get better to take back one of my exes.

Lets me talk and talk without barely any useful input or direction. On the few occasions she says something I counterargument very quickly and she always ends up agreeing with me. I feel that I outsmart her easily and that I cannot be helped by someone like that. On the second session I realize that it's been only me talking again and I am furious about paying for talking about my life. At the end of the second session I tell her ""aren't you going to give me anything to work in until the next session?"". She rushedly takes out a CBT sheet that she used for people with panic attacks, that clearly doesn't apply to my case. Scribbles something on it so I can use it for depression. I crumple the sheet and throw it away in her face (not proud about that), furious that I was just an after-thought. Never return.

**Therapist 2:**

I wasn't planning on doing any more therapy, but I come across a psychology blog from a therapist that really catches my attention. It talks about about people who feel like ""Dr Jekyll & Mr Hyde"", and how we usually try to repress ""Mr Hyde"" but he keeps taking over in the worst ways. He says this is because ""Mr Hyde""'s needs are not ackonowledged and met, and how we need to ""make friends"" with ""Mr Hyde"" to have a more balanced life. It rings a bell.

I email the author, and ask him if he would be willing to treat me through writing. I ask because with the previous therapist, I realized that in the first session I was expressing myself very smoothly, but the second one, not so much. I felt like I lost much time (and thus money) trying to discern what I felt and putting it into words. I didn't want my therapy to depend on how eloquent I'm feeling at the time. Also I'm pretty shy and I feel that I can be more open about my issues if we're not face to face. He agrees to do it, but with intention of moving over to skype in the future.

Each written session consists in 5 email exchanges:

* He asks me questions.
* I answer them as thoroughly as I can.
* He writes his thoughts and conclusions, and proposes exercises to do.
* I ask any questions I have.
* He answers them.

I found this method to be very productive. I made the most of each session because I had time to think about the questions, answer them in the most complete and truthful fashion I could, think about any doubts I had, wasn't restricted by time, etc. He gave me tools to measure my progress and talk about my feelings. We start doing CBT, but I found it too rigid and difficult to follow, so he asks me to start journaling free style, which helped a lot. Sometimes in between sessions he sends me articles and stuff that he thinks that would be relevant for my case. I feel genuinely cared for.

Everything's good until he asks me to try some gestalt-talk-to-he-chair stuff. I tell him that it sound ridiculous, and although I trust him, I would feel more comfortable doing it if he told me the use of that exercise and what evidence there is for it to work. That I pride myself on being a logical person. He tells me that he doesn't think I'm logical, that I was in fact, quite passionate. I forward him a 3 page essay about how logical I am (not proud of that one either).

I never hear from him ever again. I understand if he was offended by my reaction, but I don't think it's professional at all to leave a patient without saying anything. I tried to contact him several times and didn't get an answer, he basically ghosted me. To this day I still wonder if he was offended or there was some sort of technical issue, such as emails going to spam and stuff. If I google him, I see he's changed careers from therapist to marketing psychology.

**Therapist 3:**

After a few years of keeping my worst symptoms in check, things start going south again. A project that I was responsible for goes awry and I am extremely anxious about it. On top of that, my boyfriend is nagging me for my addiction to work, for being distant and for indulging in bad habits. I feel on the edge, so I seek help.

I see a therapist that supposedly is an expert on issues at work. Because it worked out so well with the past therapist, and my mind is really foggy from the anxiety, I ask if at least the first session could consist in me writing down all my issues so at least she has the full story before we start. She says no. I'm already angry here. I feel like I have no time and money to lose chatting abut my life and that my method is definitely better. But I repeat to myself like a mantra ""It's okay, she's the therapist, she deals with people like you everyday, she knows what she's doing, maybe it's really important to get this info in-person as in, checking my body language or whatever"" while in the back on my mind I'm like ""she only wants face-to-face because is less work for her and it takes more sessions to get to the point"".

I get to the clinic. Since I'm nervous she starts introducing herself. She says ""I consider myself an average clinician. I don't need to be the best. Mediocrity makes us free"". At that point I want to say ""Okay, keep being a free average therapist, I'll go see someone who takes his profession seriously"" and leave. But I stay. At this point I'm already aware of what narcissism is and I suspect I have it, so I keep telling myself that those feelings I have are just symptoms. But I can't help feeling the anger bubbling up.

I usually use foul language, both talking about myself and others, but it's more intended for comical effect than anything. It doesn't reflect how I really feel. But every time I talk about myself in a slightly bad light, she interrupts me to encourage me and says that I don't talk about myself that way. She seems determined from the start to treat my ""bad self-esteem"" that I don't think it's the issue. Or, maybe it is, but not in the way she thinks it is. I don't usually think badly about myself (more on the contrary) unless I'm having a crisis. If therapist 1 only let me talk and talk, this lady didn't let me barely talk at all. She interrupted constantly to do some cheap encouragement or say completely unrelated stuff.

At one point she asks if I have any phobias. I say that I don't but sometimes when it's dark and I'm alone I keep imagining terrible and phantasmagorical things that keep me from sleeping, which is weird because I'm not a superstitious person at all. I phrase it as ""I don't believe in anything"" and she replies ""but... Do you believe in yourself?"" as if she just said the deepest shit in the and I'm like ""If... I believe that I... exist?"". I wanted to scream.

But even if she has this hippie, motherly style, her body language was stiff and I had the impression that she barely tolerated me (and probably rightfully so, as I felt so much disdain for her even if I tried that it didn't show). 

I didn't feel heard at all. She seemed to have decided from the start what she was going to treat me for, that was not what I cared about or what I felt that was the problem. She insisted in having me write down negative thoughts that I told her time and time again that I didn't have. She suggested that I may have avoidant and obsessive-compulsive traits, that I think it's true. I asked her about narcissism specifically, and she told me ""you cannot be one because narcissists never go to therapy because they think they are perfect"" which contradicted much of the literature I read from therapists that deal with narcissists on the daily.

After 3 sessions I ask her again to have a written session, because I thought I needed the therapy but this wasn't working at all. I wanted to be able to explain my history without being interrupted every three words, I needed her to see the whole picture so she stopped treating me for things that she'd made up, I needed time to put my thoughts in order because my brain was a mess, and I needed to address the problems I had been having with her and I didn't want to use therapy hours for that. She insisted that she only worked in-person. I said that then we couldn't work together, that I needed more flexibility. She said she was sorry that I didn't understand her methodology... The audacity!

It left me worse than when I started. In fact I started having suicidal ideation again for the first time in years. Feeling that I was hopeless and that I wouldn't find anyone who could help me.

**Therapist 3.5:**

I write to another therapist. I ask him if he has experience dealing with people with NPD or OCPD, because I suspect that I have something along these lines, or at least that I seem to have difficulty staying in therapy from previous experiences. Instead of answering my question and addressing my concerns, he says ""Well come to therapy and we'll see!"", as if it was free and I needed more disappointment in my life. Discarded.

**Therapist 4:**

I say if you're going to do it, do it right. I search for a nationally renowned psychologist that costs a ton, also a man to avoid ""motherly"" types. I thought this way I wouldn't be hindered by my prejudices. I ask if I we can start by me writing everything I can think of that will help him get the picture (at this point my anxiety is so bad that I can barely talk without looking retarded or break down crying). He says ok. I start writing, but I can seem to finish because I avoid and I'm a mess. I tell him, ""I know I told you I'd have it by this day, but I haven't been able to. Please wait a little more"". He urges me to start by skype. I tell him, ""I don't think anything I say will make sense but okay, you're the expert"". He reassures me that he has worked with the worst of the worst and that he's confident that he'll help me. I say well ok whatever.

The first session is him talking and me looking through him absent mindedly. 90% of the questions he makes I answer ""I dunno"", because it literally hurts to think. He shows me some videos for kids that explain things about anxiety that I already know. He tells me to watch what it's probably the lamest film I've ever watched, ""The peaceful warriour"", because it is about mindfulness. I feel myself losing respect for him after that. Not because of his shitty taste in films, everybody has guilty pleasures, but for thinking that I am so gullible that I would be helped by it or by any of the stupid videos that he shows me. Again I think, ""this person cannot help me. Therapists can only help people who are gullible and stupid"", etc.

Sessions go by and all are the same. Me blankly looking at him talk things I already know about anxiety, showing me videos, etc. He also sends me some relaxation techniques. I don't actually do anything. I know I'm not putting the effort required for my recovery but I feel so empty and foggy that I don't want to do anything. The only session I liked was one that I prepared beforehand because I was feeling a little better that day. In that session I tell him to help with my motivation, because I cannot do the work and improve when I'm feeling so flat. He just says he can't do anything, that I have to pull off the work and that's it. I ask him if he'd just tell a severely depressed person just ""do the work"" or if he'd have some techniques to motivate them. I think that it's crazy that it's me the one guiding him instead of the opposite. I hang on a few sessions more and we revert to the previous pattern.

In our last session, I tell him that we need to rethink this because it obviously isn't working. He says that it won't work if I don't pull off the work and I see that it may be it, but if he cannot help me to get motivated and I cannot do it either, then I'm wasting my money. I'd rather be only sad than sad and poor. I suggest spacing out the sessions (so I would have time to have good days in between sessions and prepare them properly) and he says he's against it. Again I get angry because I think he's thinking about the money and his pride as a therapist, and not about how I feel. I tell him that another concern of mine is that we only talk about anxiety when I think I have a deeper problem. I tell him that I feel that I know already most things he says, and that I feel that he just repeats the same things over and over in between sessions. I want some direction, I want a plan, I want to know where this is going because I don't feel it's going anywhere. He gets angry. He says none of his patients ever complained about that and that he's hurt and offended. Until this point I just wanted more time to prepare the sessions properly (since he didn't seem to do it), but now I just feel embarrassed for having raised my concerns and caused a ruckus and want to leave.

I've been thinking about what was with Therapist 2 that didn't cause the same friction as with all the others. I think there's several things:

* He was an active blogger, so I knew what to expect before I contacted him and I already knew we clicked. I haven't found almost any other therapists that do that in my country. 99% of therapists websites are copypastes from manuals and wikipedia, or hippie-love-yourself-life-is-beautiful cheap philosophy (ah, the two genders).
* The system we used reduced friction because I was able to explain myself uninterrupted, reduced shame, and there was a balanced give and take.
* I made the most of the sessions and we used tools to measure my progress, so I felt like I was getting good value from my money.
* He seemed to genuinely like me and want to help me as a person. Maybe it was just my impression because I didn't see his bodily language so I was not as hyper-vigilant as with the other therapists. 
* He didn't say anything that made me lose respect of him.

I've noticed writing this that there's a recurring concern of mine that is that I feel like I'm being scammed. I want to say that I'm usually a generous person and I don't have any problem lending money, inviting people, etc. I think that what really infuriates me is thinking that I'm paying for a service that is not worth it.

I feel like writing is a good way to start, at least it was for me, and thought it may be helpful for Narcs as it alleviates some of the common concerns such as hyper-vigilance, shame, time limits, annoyances, etc. I don't think it's sustainable over time because it's slow, and Narcs need to learn social skills and frustration tolerance, but it may be a good way to warm this difficult population up for therapy.

What do you think about this? What kind of things do you think that would make you more willing to go / stay in therapy? Do you have any tips about how to reduce frustration in therapy? Any funny stories?

210,Autism and NPD,8,bjsf4t,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/bjsf4t/autism_and_npd/,5,1556784820.0,"So, I am diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder, but I have many traits that could be signs of NPD. I would describe myself as the sum of NPD and ASD. Consequently, my brand of narcissism may come across as more grandiose, or overt. I do not hide my ego, I brandish it for friends, family, and strangers alike to see. I definitely see myself as a special person because my autism has altered my brain to be very logical and oriented for math, which in my view is THE most important skill to have, and one of the hardest to learn. Consequently, my autism has also rendered me with an even stronger lack of empathy than most, and I do not care about most social relationships aside that of one person and family. I really don't care about making new friends. I struggle with anger that resembles narcissistic rage- so much as somebody acting depressed in my prescense can make me feel undervalued and trigger an agitated response. In conversations I tend to assert my prescense very strongly and impose it on everyone. If reprimanded for interrupting, I get mad. As for manipulation, I do not do this and I never lie. The most negative impact it has on my life is when I go off on my wife when she shows anything short of admiration. She is autistic too, and when she does not want me to touch or gets upset from external factors I often take this personally and get mad, this can escalate quick. I often feel like I am right and will argue myself into a frenzy if criticized. I would say that I genuinely love her but when she goes outside the bounds of my vision for our relationship I sometimes go too far in shutting down the dissent, and am not receptive to change whatsoever. 

&#x200B;

Unsure if all this qualifies me for NDP, or if it is just autism, but I feel I can relate to NPD more than most people and for what it's worth it was enough to look into it. What do think?",8
211,Am i some sort of covert narcissist or do i have simply traits of several personality disorders including Npd?,5,aal2uc,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/aal2uc/am_i_some_sort_of_covert_narcissist_or_do_i_have/,11,1546088807.0,"I am a 24 years old female from italy who has been following psychodynamic psychotherapy sessions since i was 4 and half , first with a therapist and then with another from the age of 22 . Warning for my diagnostic story, in italy many psychodynamic therapists and neuropsychiatrists  do not really believe in neurodevelopmental disorders and many more disregarded them 20 years ago.

Now for background on me and my upbringing

I was a weird kid with  very overprotective albeit loving  parents  who was behind with self-help skills and in relating to other children and this led to me being referred to group therapy sessions with other children when i was 4. However as i was faring poorly the neuropsychiatrist in charge thought that i had childhood psychosis  and suggested medication and as my parents were worried about  that diagnosis they had me evaluated  at a neuropsychiatric center where the psychiatrists diagnosed  me with Pdd-nos and gave my parents the number of a psychodynamic psychotherapist while not telling my parents that Pdd-nos was related to autism.  

 I thrived with the psychotherapist and i made good progress until i was around 10 and i developed a case of Ocd while my father was also diagnosed not long after  with parkinsons' disease and started to show signs of psychosis with persecution delusions. The next few  years were very troubled with my parents often arguing and my father often fleeing home and accusing my mother of not standing up to his supposed persecutors etc. I was pretty traumatized by the whole situation being often involved in the arguments and physically attacking one of my parents on the behalf of another parent to try to end the conflict  and i fell further behind in self-help skills as well in social skills and emotional development. Neither of my parents  incited me against the other but i was so upset by the whole thing that i physically assaulted one of them according to which parent i sided with at the time. This physical aggressivity, which i also displayed when i was called out by my mother  for my computer abuse and extreme laziness in chores,   subsided almost entirely once i was 18-19 and started to clean up my act and to mature a bit with the help of a peer mentor who quickly became one of my closest friends . 

 My mother was so worried about my immaturity, falling grades and at the time severe ocd  when i was 17 that she had me evaluated at the same neuropsychiatric centre where i had been  diagnosed with pdd-nos and, since the neuropsychiatrists  were unaware of the previous diagnosis,  i was diagnosed this time with schizoid pd. With the help of a peer mentor recommended by my psychotherapist  i greatly improved when i enrolled at the university but when i was 19  i was told by my psychotherapist that  i  had been assessed as being on the autism spectrum as a child  and  since  when i was 21-22 and writing my bachelors thesis  my therapeutic relationship with my therapist broke down i changed therapist and sought a private neuropsychiatric evaluation where i was diagnosed with asd level one with (very mild according to the psych) traits of aspergers. 

It was also found out through nonverbal iq tests  that my nonverbal iq was low normal though that did not impact my academic performance . Now sometimes i think i am  too socially competent and my narrow interests are not narrow enough  to have true Asd .  This makes me often  think  that i actually have Nld and\\or adhd inattentive type  and not Asd.

Now  as for possible traits of personality disorders i am very self-absorbed and when my empathy levels are particularly low like in this period  i often wonder if i even actually love anyone at all  rather than ""exploiting"" loved ones and friends   for emotional  confort. I have also fantasized at times  not about perfection, unlimited success or ideal love  but about receiving undue  attention for being ""special"". Ever since i was in grade school i often or at  least sometimes thought i was ""special"" but in a very negative way in  the sense of being broken or abnormal or weird since i have been coddled and taken care of all my life and i was poked fun by some of my peers  until my late high school years . 

I also often lambast myself as a person  and downplay my (academic) achievements which i have read is a trait of covert narcissism alongside insecurity, low self-esteem and being self-aware of my flaws which is also a distinct trait of my personality or rather lack of a real personality. I often view any academic achievements i obtain after the ""high"" of the good grade as the result of   narrow info absorption due to narrow interests or effort ""fooling"" teachers about my actual intellectual level. The discovery that i have  a low normal nonverbal iq has only reinforced this attitude.  I also often talk about my psychological problems to other people such as friends or acquaintances both to vent out and to be conforted and reassured as well as wanting to get  attention most likely and to be  mothered. 

 I am indeed highly approval seeking but the effect of any praise i get quickly vanishes with me being a bit ashamed of it, doubting the validity of it and being mostly satisfied of having done what i had to do as one of my main motivations for succeeding academically aside from being interested in the material is actually to prove to myself that i am worth  something. 

I  have also a  weak sense of  self-identity aside from feeling broken or weird in a way. My sense of self- agency is understandably  pretty low due to my background and i am very  wary of taking on responsibilities on my own as i often feel like people would expect too much from me and i do not think i would be able to fulfill their expectations and then also because i would have to stop to rely on other people and to be taken care of and truly grow up. I also think that by for example  putting more effort in party activites as i am a political militant  i would be ""unmasked"" as incompetent and then that i do not deserve to be a militant as i am egocentric and my motivations for being  politically active are not wholly altruistic. But then this lack of a more complete dedication makes me feel guilty for not doing the right thing and i also want to feel useful to relieve my feelings of inadequacy  and to not feel like a bad person. 

 In short i am scared of growing up. Due to my weak sense of self-identity i question internally my political alliance when confronted with material from opposing political traditions and this troubles me .  I also displayed this weak sense of self-identity as  a child since my ocd when i was a minor  often centered on a fear of changing my personality, my likes or dislikes  and my political  views. Luckily my ocd is mostly  dormant now bar some temporary outbreaks.  I also often dislike  myself and try to sabotage myself or at least think about undermining myself.

 For example it took me about an year to write my 40-pages  bachelors thesis as the thought of graduating  paralyzed me over some months   though i  had the excuse of having to get other credits before graduating and so i would have graduated later on anyway even if had finished to write it earlier. Now that i am a second year masters' degree student i find myself studying way  less than i used to  as  i am becoming again disturbed by the thought of graduating and then i am getting a bit bored by university life and  more inattentive .

 Due to my habit of pathologizing myself my therapist won't diagnose with any personality disorder and it is indeed better if i do not get formally diagnosed with any pd again. However i am also not  a manipulative person though i have emotionally abused my parents in the  past when angered with them  and i usually stick to being truthful about what i feel and i think only embellishing feelings of affection or exaggerating suffering to satisfy my dependency needs.  This truthfulness and belief that it is immoral to lie about yourself  may be a result of my developmental  disability. I have lied in the past and i do lie but my behaviour is transparent overall.

Thank you for reading it.

To me it sounds like i have some Npd traits but i think it  is more of an hodgepodge of traits of several  pds including a strong dependent streak as well.  Maybe i have some sort of mixed or unspecified  pd or maybe i am just pathologizing myself. Plus i was diagnosed once with schizoid pd but i do not know how this meshes with having been twice diagnosed on the spectrum and my tentative diagnosis of childhood psychosis which considering the state of the treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders in Italy 20 years ago  is a ringing bell for the fact that i am indeed developmentally disabled though maybe not meeting the full requirements for asd.

Nowadays i am feeling often  slightly miserable in the sense of being aim-less, irrationally toying with the idea of wanting to fail at life  and semi-emotionally dead.

 To be more precise regarding past trauma my father  attempted to flee home countless times when he could  still walk but only managed to do it twice",5

Recently a user answered to my first post, in which I argued that narcs do not willfully plan their actions. As a self-aware narc, I am not allowed to respond directly in the [r/narcissisticAbuse](https://www.reddit.com/r/narcissisticAbuse) sub, but I learned to respect that. Moreover I would like to point out that I want this discussion to be respectful, which is why I thank you for your kind words at the beginning of your text. I will try to reply as clearly as possible.

*"" Even if they don't actively plan it out, they spend the entire relationship subconsciously plotting an exit plan that ultimately maximizes the damage they cause us. At the least, they don't care about the pain they inevitably cause. At the most, they enjoy causing it. ""*

You mention the word ""subconsciously"" various times throughout the text. The cambridge dictionary definition for subconscious is as follows: "" **the part of your** **mind that notices and remembers** **information when you are not actively** **trying to do so, and influences** **your** **behaviour** **even though you do not realize it** "". We can agree on that one. When it comes to the pain we cause, I can only say that we do not have **the ability** to care about the pain we cause, at least If we dont work on it. We enjoy the abuse, but its the same kind of ""joy"" that a drugaddict experiences when taking drugs. Ultimately it does not benefit us (and definetely does not benefit you). The pain we cause just feeds our sick ego, which will also harm us in the long run as well.

*"" What was the first thing all of our narcs did? Try to find out everything there was to know about us, of course. Their appetite for knowledge about us was insatiable. Why? It's because they know, subconsciously at least, that later they'll need to know all our weaknesses for the sake of their own ""self defense"" or ""revenge,"" and they'll need to know it pronto. It's the same tactic used in cult inductions. Can't tell when one of those uppity neurotypicals will need to be brought back into line, after all. It also helps to know everything about us in the meantime so they can morph into whatever archetype we need to heal our childhood issues ""*

Im sorry, but no. We do not engage in relationships in order to plan our evil exit beforehand. Relationships which include narcissistic abuse are always codependent relationships: Just like we fill some sort of void in you, you fill some sort of void in us. The abusive characteristics come into play when both people with childhood trauma interact with each other. It might sound silly, but: Narcissism and Codependency have a lot in common, atleast when it comes to their psychological origins. Narcs had to play a ""role"" in order to get love and affection, while codependents only feel themselves when they fully give up their own interests for the sake of others. Its not (and never will be) a onesided phenomenon, where the narc preys upon the codependent. It might seem that way, but it simply isn't. No matter how much pain was caused.

"" *That's not normal. That's not natural. Moving at that conversational pace indicates the brain is entering an unsustainable obsessive mode, rather than approaching getting to know this new person from a long-term and more balanced perspective. The best you could say about it is that it's how 13 year olds act when they get crushes. I remember my Nex wouldn't even let me give full answers to his questions on our first date because he was so eager to know everything else about me.* ""

True. The way we narcs approach relationships is quite childish, since our emotional development got crippled.

""*This strategy of exposing our weaknesses is calculated from the moment they assess us as potentially juicy victims*.""

See my answer above.

""*\[...\] The real question is, how far in the depths of their consciousness does this realization lie? And how could we possibly know what layer of their consciousness it lies in, since their M.O. is to uphold their delusional framework of understanding the world, at all times? If they lie to even themselves, how could we possibly hope to uncover the truth for them? And if we manage to uncover it, what can we do when they only shut us down for speaking the truth? Especially if it threatens their precious delusional narrative.*""

You cant uncover the truth for us. Its simply not possible. A narc has to understand on his own how to deal with his toxic behaviour.

But then again, we sincerely believe that whatever we do to you is justified. A narc has to find a way to get around his own toxic belief-system. Usually, this happens when they completely hit rock-bottom. Atleast thats when I began to change.

""*\[..\] maybe they don't even want to destroy us consciously; but you can bet your ass that subconsciously they know something about them is deeply fucked up. Ultimately the reason they're so persuasive during the lovebombing and devaluation stages is because they believe their own delusional fantasies first, and then suck us into them too using sweet, empty promises.*""

True, only with the difference that we believe our own ""sweet, empty promises"". But then again, knowing something **subconsciously** excludes to possibility of **actively** planning something. Please keep that in mind.

"" *In other words, the best case scenario is that they subconsciously know they will hurt us when they start dating us. The worst case scenario is they consciously set out to hurt us.* ""

Lets assume the best case scenario ;). I will redefine your definition and say that we are ""subconsciously set out to hurt you to feed our toxic belief-system that hurts us as well as everyone around us"". Again, I will have to point out that, atleast in the long run, narcissists will always end up miserable and alone if they do not stop their toxic behaviour. Superficially, we seem to get a rush out of it, but you can sure as hell bet that all this abusive bullshit is not in our own interest either. Problem is: If we do not understand our condition, we will never be able to stop that shit.

""*\[...\] But they damn well know at some level of their consciousness that they have no business being around neurotypicals, except to prey on us.* ""

You are not neurotypical. You are codependent. Even if your behaviour is not toxic for those around you, it is still psychologically fragile behaviour that needs to be changed (for your own interest).

""*So for any narcs reading this post-- and I know you're out there because I know how your kind work, that you lurk on this sub to gain information on us-- I urge you to be honest with yourselves while you still can. You may not start a relationship consciously thinking to yourself, ""Wow wouldn't it be great if I hurt this person so much that they killed themselves because of what I do to them?"" But you damn well know deep down that every relationship with you ends that way, or teeters on the brink of that outcome. So armed with that knowledge, ask yourself: Do I really want to hurt, abuse and exploit people? Or should I learn some goddamn self control, get some goddamn self respect, take some goddamn responsibility and haul my ass to therapy and be goddamn honest with my therapist so I can grow and learn healthier coping mechanisms?*""

Well I actually read the sub because I am interested in the topic.

I know now that relationships can have the tendency to turn toxic If I do not watch out. I completely agree with the rest of your statement. Narcs should learn self-control, self-respect (this is especially important) and we need to take responsibility for our actions. True. True. True. 100%.

""*Many people have said there is no hope for narcs to change. I dare you to prove them wrong, with everything that is in you.*

*For those narcs reading this and thinking to themselves, ""I like the way I am because it makes me strong, thank you very much,"" ohhh, you don't understand. In ten years, we're going to make your kind so well known and so exposed that you will have nowhere to hide. You think you're fine now because you've been able to hide your tracks in the past. Think again. In ten years, the devastating and all-encompassing effects of narcissistic abuse will be so well documented, well researched and well known that you're going to be seen the same way that racists and rapists are today. You will extricated from polite society. The jig will be up.*

*So consider that, just as racists and rapists a couple decades ago thought they could get away with abuse, you will find yourself in the same situation before long. Are you going to make the conscious decision to better yourself now, while there's still time? Or will you let all of your shame and evil deeds be exposed to the world as we mock you for being so pathetic and empty?*

*You see yourself as the hero in your story. The world knows you to be the villain. Choose your path while there is still hope*.""

I will try my best to prove that narcs have the ability to change. Narcs that think that their behaviour ""makes them strong"" literally understood nothing about their disorder. At some point in our life, we had to adapt this behaviour in order to survive, but later on in life it becomes toxic. It does not make us stronger, it makes us pathetic and miserable.

Then again, do not compare us with racists and rapists. It is not the same. No amount of anger or pain we caused will change that. We are neither ""devils"" nor ""monsters"". I know many of you feel the need to think that way in order to maintain the distance between your narc and yourself... but just because a belief helps you, does not make it true.

On the other hand, you have to take every action to protect yourself. You have every right to do so. You are allowed to protect yourself against someone whose behavior is not consciously controlled.

Its okay to distance yourself from someone who is not a monster. You do not need to believe that.",26

What is the approach in therapy when the problem is you? And you are causing distress and heartache to all your friends and family? I know that the person suffering the most is herself. Her life is in no way the fairy tale she dreamed about since she was a child. 

I'm genuinely concerned for my sister. She has a big but fragile ego. I worry that it will be difficult for her to work on her problems because she always feels threatened and angered by any life advice or constructive criticism. She is old enough to refuse to go to therapy although it would really help her.

I made it to 6:30, when she insinuated that something I'd done would be considered criminal behavior if I were someone else. I could do nothing but walk away from that. I stewed for an hour, then came out to question her and ensure I understood. 

The hook here is that indeed I had misunderstood. But I ignored that and raged on. This will be one of the pivotal moments I'll focus on when I work through this in therapy. 

So I ripped into her, told her she was too reliant on me, she needs other people to turn to too. I can't shoulder this alone. She says her worst case scenario is that she ends up being ""too much"" for me, but I can't handle this distorted thinking any more from someone who refuses to address her own problems with the intensity that I address mine.

Most of what I have to tell doesn't make much sense without knowing my situation, so please bear with me explaining what drove me to therapy.

The main reason I'm going to therapy right now is because I have severe avoidance issues at work. I only noticed when year and a half ago I ruined an important project I was in charge of. The reason is that I spent almost all the time until the deadline in analysis-paralysis and doing preemptive optimization. As the project gained complexity and the deadline got closer I started panicking and avoiding. I'd spend all my working hours doing stuff that had nothing to do with work, even when I was fully aware that I was making things worse. I couldn't help it because I couldn't bear to think of work. I didn't report my difficulties to the rest of the staff or asked for help, due to shame. I kept an appearance of normalcy and became defensive when someone asked, until it all blew up. The deadline was extended several times but I wasn't able to perform and in the end, I made my company lose lots of money and was laid off.

I had always thought that I had great potential and only needed to be given the opportunity and resources to shine. Only in retrospective I noticed that I had always had productivity issues related to anxiety, perfectionism and avoidance. It's just that until now, I had always been able to get away with it somehow. The process had always almost been the same even when I was in school: start late because I overestimate my abilities and just don't feel like doing it, only start working when the deadline is close (personal goals with no imposed deadlines always kept getting pushed to the distant future), and then instead of being realistic and adapt the quality of the work to the time available, I get super obsessive and detail-oriented, then the teacher/client/boss is surprised by the quality of the little work done and agrees to extend the deadline, rinse and repeat, until everybody is mad at me and I'm drowning in anxiety and I end up delivering a half-baked product with some parts extremely well-made and some parts looking rushed.

I think I could probably do stuff that satisfies my quality standards and still deliver on time, if only I could get myself to work and make the most of my time. But no matter how many times I go though this cycle, no matter how much I suffer because of it, I feel helpless. Not only that but after becoming aware of this tendency of mine my anxiety levels have skyrocketed, thinking about work causes me more aversion than ever, and not being productive one day terrifies me and throws me into a pseudo-depression that lasts several days.

I started going to therapy again because after getting fired from my latest job, I wasn't able to be productive at all. I didn't look for a new job, I didn't put nearly enough hours into a freelance gig I got afterwards, I wasn't taking care of myself... I was mostly getting high, eating trash, sleeping 12h a day, playing videogames, watching porn, browsing the internet... Whatever I could do to distract myself from thinking. I had such a brain fog and my short-term memory had become so bad that I'd swore I had lost 50 IQ points. Thinking was painful. I needed help because I was nearly broke and feeling completely unable to function, much less in a professional setting. 

As for my interpersonal difficulties, I don't have much of that nowadays. Most of them stem from the productivity-related anxiety, as I don't feel like I can be nice and care about other people needs when I feel so burdened myself. If I'm avoiding because I can't stand the pressure and you come to me with additional problems or requests, chances are I'm going to avoid you too. That's why my priority is completely on productivity right now. 

I think my SO doesn't help. I hadn't been with anyone before that didn't think I was super intelligent, hard-working, moral, confident, etc. But he sees right through me, knows I'm at least 50% façade and it makes me uncomfortable. Aside of becoming aware of my productivity issues, the hardest hit to my self-confidence in the recent years has been realizing that my partner doesn't admire me. I often wonder if I can stay in a relationship with a partner that is indifferent or averse to everything I like about me. He's also very hedonistic (either enables my avoidant traits or annoys me when I don't want to be wasting time) and is depressive and pessimistic, tearing down any initiative I may show. It's come to a point where I don't ask for his feedback at all. Not saying my lack of confidence is all his fault but I have to work through my issues in spite of him. He also wants me to work on some issues that don't bother me at all, such as my avoidant attachment style.

So now, lets get to how did the sessions go:

The 6th session was a complete waste of time. I had been on a bender the previous days and I had even forgotten I had a session. I was very depressed too. So basically I didn't pay any attention, just wanted to get out as quickly as possible. If anything this session was useful to confirm that going to therapy was useless if I didn't take my time to prepare for it.

In the 7th session I'm still in the same situation: barely working a few hours a week in my freelance project and freaking out. I ask if she thinks it would be useful to go to the psychiatrist and get some meds to tune down the anxiety and help me focus. She says to try something else before getting to that: to go for 30 minute walks everyday and having a morning routine (dressing up and getting a shower even if I'm not going to go out and stuff like that). Very basic wellness advice that I wasn't doing because I didn't want more excuses to avoid working, but things can't go worse anyway. We also talk a little about how I feel my SO hinders me, tells me to think of it as projection on his part when he brings me down.  

I try to follow the advice for two weeks and I also start an emotional journal, I think it will help me remember stuff that I want to bring to therapy and also will help my therapist to know how my mind works (I don't always bring everything to therapy because it embarrasses me to talk about certain things or I don't think they're important). At first it's really difficult because I've caught the habit of not thinking about my emotions (the first day I spent 3 hours writing). But after a few days I notice my mind becoming more agile. I also start keeping track of all my pending tasks and attending stuff I had put aside. I'm working barely the same hours but I'm taking better care of myself, doing other stuff, etc.

During this time and without me doing any search at all, I also get a job offer from former clients of mine. It's very validating because I know for sure these people don't like me personally but haven't found anyone with my profile and skills and are basically humiliating themselves begging me to work with them. I get a little grandiose here and manage to settle a good deal with them. The grandiosity feels fragile and fake though, on the back of my mind I'm thinking ""if you knew how I really am you wouldn't want me to work with you"". I'm scared of messing up again. Also I feel accepting the offer as a defeat, as I don't like those people and the project isn't aligned with my long term goals. But I didn't feel capable of going job-hunting and I was almost broke so I really didn't have other choice. I also have a few days here where I'm a mix of hypomanic and anxious, become really irritable and unable to sleep.

I also get an analytic when it shows my vitamin D levels are dangerously low that can be contributing to my depression. I feel somewhat relieved that there may be a medical reason for my depressive symptoms and ""it's not like I'm crazy or weak"".

In the 8th session the therapist tells me to not look at the new job as a defeat but as a ""wise decision"" or a ""transition"" (""I've been my whole life making wise decisions it seems, I wonder when I'm going to actually achieve a goal"", I think). She has always insisted that it was important to talk about my relationship so now that things in the professional area seem to be getting better, we start talking about stuff from my relationship that I don't like. She asks for example, if I think I perfom better when I'm with acquaintances instead of my partner because I feel supported by my friends but not by my him. I say I don't think so, that it's a matter of not wanting to look like a loser and a bum in front of my friends, but there's no use in trying to trick my partner, he knows me too well. She says that trying to hide my vulnerabilities in front of others can be contributing to my anxiety, that I'm unnecessarily putting pressure on myself to perform and the things we hide become a source of embarrassment. I'm supposed to feel better for opening up but whenever I do it and even if people react well, I end up feeling uncomfortable with those people.

We also talk about a little conflict I had with my partner, he made a negative comment about a series I like and I immediately felt ashamed for liking it, which translated in me feeling resentful towards him for ruining it for me. However I managed it well I think, I didn't say anything until I had calmed down and then I let him know that the comment he made had hurt me and asked him to not to say that kind of stuff. I didn't feel better afterwards, I felt kind of ridiculous actually but I guess it's a necessary evil. If not the resentment would have built up and I would have wanted to get even. The therapist asks me to remember other instances when I've felt similar. I recall my mother making fun of ""chinese cartoons"" when I watched anime as a child and my partner responding ""why would I want to do that?"" when I asked him if he'd like to have a shared music list on Spotify (something I've done with close friends and boyfriends in the past and I've enjoyed). I guess it's easy to make me feel ashamed for enjoying something unless I can defend it on a rational level.

She tells me to change my mentality of ""if someone disagrees with my taste they're ridiculing me"" and ""if people give me only a little of what I need, it's pity/leftovers"". Easier said than done.

Not much happens in between session 8 and 9. I get into a fight with my partner because he overhears something I've said to the therapist and he accuses me of lying to make him look bad, ""as I always do with everyone"". Tell him my perception of things may be skewed but that I'm not lying, just saying how I experience things. Says he doesn't want to be with someone who sees him like that then. Tell him if he doesn't like it he's free to leave. Not my smoothest but I'm honestly not up for this shit. He ends up calming down on his own and we end up having a few good days. We talk about the possibility of him getting therapy too because he's really depressive and avoidant too, in fact he hasn't had a job in his whole life because of his issues. I don't feel like being the only one carrying all the financial and emotional burden indefinitely.

Then I get in a conflict with my father because he offers me a job at his company and I refuse, for the same reasons I didn't like the job I accepted, it's not aligned with my long-term goals. I try to explain him my reasons while he looks at me with a blank expression like it doesn't compute, he ends up saying stuff like ""I don't think you understand"" and ""What a weird daughter I've raised"", like he didn't even considered that I may refuse, lol.

I'm keeping up with the journal, the routine, the work, etc. In fact I become a little obsessed with it, freaking out whenever something falls out of place. I'm starting to feel overwhelmed too, like I cannot afford to fail or I'll get depressed again and that I cannot keep the same pace indefinitely. So even when I'm doing good, I'm feeling quite a lot of anxiety. 

In the 9th session we talk about the mishap with my father. She asks me if there's any hidden motives why I don't want to work with him and I explain that it's nothing like that, on the contrary, I used to admire him and I'm not used to letting him down, I wish I was eager to work with him, but I'm not. She congratulates me for managing the situation well and being assertive and asks me what I think helped. I think having thought about the same stuff previously because of the job offer I got and writing it down in the diary. I that my aggressiveness often comes from the impotence of not being able to put my uneasy feelings into words and that writing in the diary helps with that. 

I'm really clumsy at telling my emotions apart and describing them. When she asks about how I'd describe I've felt these latest days I take minutes to answer. I say I've felt ""stable"", not too good or bad. She says if I'd describe it as ""tranquility"" or ""peace"" and I say not at all, because I'm always somewhat anxious. She doesn't see that as something bad, as we have established in previous sessions that I need some pressure to feel motivated to work. Her words however discourage me. Am I damned to feel always on the edge? If it's normal why doesn't any of the people I know seem to feel like I do? She says because it's in your personality to care about stuff your friends don't. Okay. Tells me to not overdo it, that nothing happens if I don't write one day or I don't need to get really exhaustive when I write. Guess she doesn't know me, lol.

I also talk about the possibility of my partner getting therapy too, that instead of me going every week we could take turns. She thinks that I should stick to therapy for a while and take turns with my partner once I'm more stable. Says that I can lead him by example too.

After the 9th session I've been feeling increasingly overwhelmed, until I've gotten into pre-therapy routine again: I've stopped writing in the diary, I'm barely working the minimum to not get caught, doing nothing once I get home, getting into stupid fights with my partner. I guess I was at my wits end already and hearing that I should just suck it up, and getting no useful advice in accordance to my problems, was too much.

One thing that has blocked me these weeks is that I have to reply to an email from an old friend and I've been postponing it for months. I compromise myself to stop postponing it which results in me not replying and not doing anything else either because I should be replying. I guess it's an emotional effort that I don't want to do right now.

In the 10th session I want to talk about how overwhelmed I feel but somehow we go back to talking about my relationship with my partner and my friend to whom I haven't replied. Honestly I couldn't care less about that right now, I want to talk about the anxiety I feel and how to be productive. We talk again about how trying to project an image of imperturbability isn't healthy, but I feel worse when I don't so unless she can make me see how I benefit from it it's probably not happening. We talk again about something that happens to me that I often show physiological cues of being distraught (like crying) without feeling anything. She insists it's sadness I feel but I'm not aware of it. I think the only emotion I can tell apart in those moments is impotence for not being able to hold it back and express myself as I'd like to. 

Revisiting some moments I've felt anger lately we get to the conclusion that most of the time it's due to a lack of recognition (e.g: my partner not appreciating what I do for him). Even though I didn't mention it, I think I have little tolerance for incompetence in others too, and for getting disturbed when I'm focused. I think that all this mentalization-based therapy is about is retelling emotionally charged situations over and over and trying to learn to recognize those feelings and grow tolerance for them.

At the end she asks me if I've felt any improvements in comparison to the first session and honestly, I think everything that has helped has little to do with therapy (e.g: the job offer, the vitamins). I can express my feelings nicely as long as I've written about it before (if not I can take minutes to describe what I'm feeling if I can at all), nothing I didn't know before. I guess the routine and the walks helped, but again nothing I didn't know.  And currently I'm as anxious as ever or worse.

I think the thing that helps the most is having someone to check on me on the regular, and the hope of it helping in the future. I don't know what I'd do if I was left on my own.

And that's all for now. I think in the next session we have I'm going to try to redirect the therapy to the issues that matter to me and maybe tell her how some of the comments she's made have made me feel (discouraged, like she doesn't get me, like they aren't useful, etc). I may bring up again the thing about going to the psychiatrist. I hope I can find a way to do it without her feeling bad about it. Even though it sounds as if I'm unhappy with my therapist, I'm really not and I plan to keep going.",9
216,Fighting the internal battle,6,9c3d2z,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/9c3d2z/fighting_the_internal_battle/,8,1535811444.0,"I have been researching non stop for help and guidance, only coming up empty handed. I finally found this article by Tara Brach and is opened a whole new world for me.
I wanted to post it here for anyone else that may be struggling.



Our most fundamental sense of well-being is derived from the conscious experience of belonging. Relatedness is essential to survival. When we feel part of the whole, connected to our bodies, each other, and the living Earth, there is a sense of inherent rightness, of being wakeful and in love. The experience of universal belonging is at the heart of all mystical traditions. In realizing non-separation, we come home to our primordial and true nature.

The Buddha taught that suffering arises out of feeling separate. To the degree that we identify as a separate self, we have the feeling that something is wrong, something is missing. We want life to be different from the way it is. An acute sense of separation—living inside of a contracted and isolated self—amplifies feelings of vulnerability and fear, grasping and aversion. Feeling separate is an existential trance in which we have forgotten the wholeness of our being.

Never in the history of the world has the belief in a separate self been so exaggerated and prevalent as it is now in the twenty-first century in the West. In contrast to Asian and other traditional societies, our distinctive mode of identification is as individuals, without stable pre-existing contexts of belonging to families, communities, tribes or religious groups. Our desperate efforts to enhance and protect this fragile self have caused an unprecedented degree of severed belonging at all levels in our society. In our attempts to dominate the natural world, we have separated ourselves from the Earth. In our efforts to prove and defend ourselves, we have separated ourselves from each other. Managing life from our mental control towers, we have separated ourselves from our bodies and hearts.

With our Western experience of an extremely isolated self, we exemplify fully what the Buddha described as self-centered suffering. If we identify as a separate self, we become the background “owner” of whatever occurs. Ajahn Buddhadasa, a twentieth-century Thai meditation master, describes this conditioning to attach an idea of self to experience as “I-ing” and my-ing. Life happens emotions well up, sensations arise, events come and go and we then add onto the experiences that they are happening to me, because of me.

When inevitable pain arises, we take it personally. We are diagnosed with a disease or go through a divorce, and we perceive that we are the cause of unpleasantness (we’re deficient) or that we are the weak and vulnerable victim (still deficient). Since everything that happens reflects on me, when something seems wrong, the source of wrong is me. The defining characteristic of the trance of separation is this feeling and fearing of deficiency.

Both our upbringing and our culture provide the immediate breeding ground for this contemporary epidemic of feeling deficient and unworthy. Many of us have grown up with parents who gave us messages about where we fell short and how we should be different from the way we are. We were told to be special, to look a certain way, to act a certain way, to work harder, to win, to succeed, to make a difference, and not to be too demanding, shy or loud. An indirect but insidious message for many has been, “Don’t be needy.” Because our culture so values independence, self-reliance and strength, even the word needy evokes shame. To be considered as needy is utterly demeaning, contemptible. And yet, we all have needs—physical, sexual, emotional, spiritual. So the basic message is, “Your natural way of being is not okay; to be acceptable you must be different from the way you are.”

Almost two decades ago, author John Bradshaw and others enlarged our cultural self-awareness by calling attention to the crippling effect of shame. Since then, many have recognized the pervasive presence of shame much as we might an invisible toxin in the air we breathe. Feeling “not good enough” is that often unseen engine that drives our daily behavior and life choices. Fear of failure and rejection feeds addictive behavior. We become trapped in workaholism—an endless striving to accomplish—and we overconsume to numb the persistent presence of fear.

In the most fundamental way, the fear of deficiency prevents us from being intimate or at ease anywhere. Failure could be around any corner, so it is hard to lay down our hypervigilance and relax. Whether we fear being exposed as defective either to ourselves or to others, we carry the sense that if they knew . . . , they wouldn’t love us. A winning entry in a Washington Post T-shirt contest highlights the underlying assumption of personal deficiency that is so emblematic of our Western culture: “I have occasional delusions of adequacy.”

During high school, I consciously struggled with not liking myself, but during college I was distressed by the degree of self-aversion. On a weekend outing, a roommate described her inner process as “becoming her own best friend.” I broke down sobbing, overwhelmed at the degree to which I was unfriendly toward my life. My habit for years had been to be harsh and judgmental toward what I perceived as a clearly flawed self. My attachment to self-improvement transferred itself into the domain of spiritual practice. While I realized at the time that kindness was intrinsic to the spiritual path, in retrospect it is clear how feeling unworthy directly shaped my approach to spiritual life.

I moved into an ashram and spent twelve years trying to be more pure—waking up early, doing hours of yoga and meditation, organizing my life around service and community. I had some idea that if I really applied myself, it would take eight or ten years to awaken spiritually. The activities were wholesome, but I was still aiming to upgrade a flagging self. Periodically I would go to see a spiritual teacher I admired and inquire, “So, how am I doing? What else can I do?” Invariably these different teachers responded, “Just relax.” I wasn’t sure what they meant, but I didn’t think they really meant “relax.” How could they? I clearly wasn’t “there” yet.

During a six-week Buddhist meditation retreat, I spent at least twelve days with a stomach virus. Not only was there physical discomfort, but I found that I made myself “wrong” for being sick. Having already struggled with chronic sickness, this retreat made it clear just how harshly I had been relating to myself. Sickness had become another sign of personal deficiency. My assumption was that I didn’t know how to take care of myself. I feared that being sick reflected unworthiness and a basic lack of spiritual maturity.

In one of the evening dharma talks, a teacher said, “The boundary to what we can accept is the boundary to our freedom.” For me this rang incredibly true. I had been hitting that boundary repeatedly, contracted by the almost invisible tendency to believe something was wrong with me. Wrong if I was fatigued, wrong if my mind was wandering, wrong if I was anxious, wrong if I was depressed. The overlay of shame converted unpleasant experiences into a verdict on self. Pain turned into suffering. In the moment that I made myself wrong, the world got small and tight. I was in the trance of unworthiness.

Several years ago, at a meeting with a group of Western teachers, the Dalai Lama expressed astonishment at the degree of self-aversion and feelings of unworthiness reported by Western students. I know many friends and students who have found, as I did, that even after decades of spiritual practice, they are still painfully burdened by feelings of personal deficiency. Many assumed that meditation alone would take care of it. Instead, they found that deep pockets of shame and self-aversion had a stubborn way of persisting over the years.

Carl Jung describes a paradigm shift in understanding the spiritual path: Rather than climbing up a ladder seeking perfection, we are unfolding into wholeness. We are not trying to transcend or vanquish the difficult energies that we consider wrong—the fear, shame, jealousy, anger. This only creates a shadow that fuels our sense of deficiency. Rather, we are learning to turn around and embrace life in all its realness—broken, messy, vivid, alive.

Yet even when our intention in spiritual practice is to include the difficult energies, we still have strong conditioning to resist their pain. The experience of shame—feeling fundamentally deficient—is so excruciating that we will do whatever we can to avoid it. The etymology of the word shame is “to cover.” Rather than feel the rawness of shame, we develop life strategies to cover and compensate for its presence. We stay physically busy and mentally preoccupied, absorbed in endless self-improvement projects. We numb ourselves with food and other substances. We try to control and change ourselves with self-judgment or relieve insecurity by blaming others. We are so sufficiently defended that we can spend years meditating and never really include in awareness the feared and rejected parts of our experience.

Often those who feel plagued by not being good enough are drawn to idealistic cosmologies that highlight the sense of personal deficiency but offer the possibility of becoming a dramatically different person. The quest for perfection is based on the assumption that we are faulty and must purify and transcend our lower nature. This perception of spiritual hierarchy, of progressing from a lower to a higher self, can be found in elements of most Western and Eastern religions.

When we are in the process of trying to ascend, we never arrive and always feel spiritually insufficient. This was clearly the case during my first years of practice in pursuit of becoming a more perfect yogi. The temporary and passing states of peace or rapture were never enough to soothe my underlying sense of unworthiness. I felt continuously compelled to do more. An alternative face of such insecurity is spiritual pride. The very accomplishments—like improved concentration or periods of bliss—if owned by the self, reinforce a sense of a deficient self that is moving up the ladder. With either pride or shame, our awareness is identified as an entity that is separate and afraid of failure.

In my own unfolding, as well as with friends, clients and dharma students, an intentional spotlight on shame and unworthiness has been enormously revealing. Many people have told me that when they realize how pervasive their self-aversion is and how long their life has been imprisoned by shame, it brings up a sense of grief as well as life-giving hope. Fear of deficiency is a prison that prevents us from belonging to our world. Healing and freedom become possible as we include the shadow—the unwanted, unseen and unfelt parts of our being—in a wakeful and compassionate awareness.

For a child to feel belonging, he or she needs to feel understood and loved. We each feel a fundamental sense of connectedness when we are seen and when what is seen is held in love. We habitually relate to our inner life in the same way that others attended to us. When our parents (and the larger culture) don’t respond to our fears, are too preoccupied to really listen to our needs or send messages that we are falling short, we then adopt similar ways of relating to our own being. We disconnect and banish parts of our inner life.

Meditation practices are a form of spiritual reparenting. We are transforming these deeply rooted patterns of inner relating by learning to bring mindfulness and compassion to our life. An open and accepting attention is radical because it flies in the face of our conditioning to assess what is happening as wrong. We are deconditioning the habit of turning against ourselves, discovering that in this moment’s experience nothing is missing or wrong.

The trance of unworthiness, sustained by the movement of blaming, striving and self-numbing, begins to lift when we stop the action. The Buddha engaged in his mythic process of awakening after coming to rest under the bodhi tree. We start to cut through the trance in the moment that we, like the Buddha, discontinue our activity and pay attention. Our willingness to stop and look—what I call the sacred art of pausing—is at the center of all spiritual practice. Because we get so lost in our fear-driven busyness, we need to pause frequently.

The Buddha realized his natural wisdom and compassion through a night-long encounter with the forces of greed, hatred and delusion. We face the shadow deities by pausing and attending to whatever presents itself—judgment, depression, anxiety, obsessive thinking, compulsive behavior. Because shame and fear often are not fully conscious, we can deepen this attention by inquiring into what is happening. Caring self-inquiry invites the habitually hidden parts of our being into awareness.

If I pause in the midst of feeling even mildly anxious or depressed and ask, “What am I believing?” I usually discover an assumption that I am falling short or about to fail in some way. The emotions around this belief become more conscious as I further inquire, “What wants attention or acceptance in this moment?” Frequently I find contractions of fear under the story of insufficiency. I find that the trance is sustained only when I reject or resist experience. As I recognize the mental story and open directly to the bodily sense of fear, the trance of unworthiness begins to dissolve.

There are times that the grip of fear and shame is overt and vicelike. At a retreat I led a few years ago a young man named Ron came into an interview with me and announced that he was the most judgmental person in the world. He went on to prove his point, describing how scathing he was toward his every thought, mood and behavior. When he felt back pain, he concluded that he was an “out of shape couch potato, not fit for a zafu.” When his mind wandered, he concluded he was hopeless as a meditator. During the lovingkindness meditation, he was disgusted to find that his heart felt like a cold stone. In approaching an interview with me, he felt caught in the clutch of fear, embarrassed that he would be wasting my time. While others were not exempt, his most constant barrage of hostility was directed at himself. I asked him if he knew how long he had been turning so harshly on himself. He paused for quite a while, his eyes welling up with tears. It was for as long as he could remember. He had joined in with his mother, relentlessly badgering himself and turning away from the hurt in his heart.

The recognition of how many moments of his life had been lost to self-hatred brought up a deep sorrow. I invited him to sense where his body felt the most pain and vulnerability. He pointed to his heart, and I asked him how he felt toward his hurting heart at that moment. “Sad,” he responded, “and very sorry.” I encouraged him to communicate that to his inner life—to put his hand on his heart and send the message, “I care about this suffering.” As he did so, Ron began to weep deeply.

In Buddhist meditation, a traditional compassion practice is to see suffering and offer our prayer of care. Thich Nhat Hanh suggests that when we are with someone who is in pain, we might offer this deeply healing message: “Darling, I care about your suffering.” We rarely offer this care or tenderness to ourselves. We are definitely not used to touching ourselves, bringing the same tenderness that we might to stroking the cheek of a sleeping child, and gently placing a hand on our own cheek or heart. For the remaining days of the retreat, this was Ron’s practice. When he became aware of judging, he would consciously feel the vulnerability in his body—the place that for so long had felt pushed away, frightened, rejected. With a very gentle touch, he would place his hand on his heart and send the prayer of care. Ron was sitting in the front of the meditation hall, and I noticed that his hand was almost always resting on his heart.

When we met before the closing of the retreat, Ron’s whole countenance was transformed. His edges had softened, his body was relaxed, his eyes were bright. Rather than feeling embarrassed, he seemed glad to see me. He said that the judgments had been persistent but not so brutal. By feeling the woundedness and offering care, he had opened out of the rigid roles of judge and accused. He went on to tell me something that had touched him deeply. When he had been walking in the woods, he passed a woman who was standing still and crying quietly. He stopped several minutes later down the trail and could feel his heart hold and care for her sadness. Self-hatred had walled him off from his world. The experience of connection and caring for another was the blessing of a heart that was opening.

The Buddha said that our fear is great, but greater yet is the truth of our connectedness. Whereas Ron was able to rediscover connection and loosen the trance of unworthiness by tenderly offering kindness to his wounds, we might feel too small, too tight and aversive to open to the pain that is moving through us. At these times it helps to reach out, to discover an enlarged belonging through our friends, sangha, family and the living Earth. A man approached the Dalai Lama and asked him how to deal with the enormous fear he was feeling. The Dalai Lama responded that he should imagine he was in the lap of the Buddha.

Any pathway toward remembering our belonging to this world alleviates the trance of separation and unworthiness. After his night under the bodhi tree, the Buddha was very awake but not fully liberated. Mara had retreated but not vanished. With his right hand, the Buddha touched the ground and called on the Earth goddess to bear witness. By reaching out and honoring his connectedness to all life, his belonging to the web of life, the Buddha realized the fullness of freedom.

We are not walking this path alone, building spiritual muscles, climbing the ladder to become more perfect. Rather, we are discovering the truth of our relatedness through belonging to these bodies and emotions, to each other, and to this whole natural world. As we realize our belonging, the trance of unworthiness dissolves. In its place is not worthiness; that is another assessment of self. Rather, we are no longer compelled to blame or hide or fix our being. When we turn and embrace what has felt so personal, we awaken from feelings of separateness and find that we are in love with all of life.",6
217,Advice on how to be there for a possible NPD,7,7xavay,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/7xavay/advice_on_how_to_be_there_for_a_possible_npd/,14,1518541788.0,"TL;DR at bottom.

My boyfriend (30/m) hasn't been diagnosed as NPD (he went to a therapist for about 3 months a couple of years back - not sure if therapists are the ones who can diagnose?) but he definitely exhibits a lot of NPD traits.

I've lurked this sub for a few days and am encouraged to hear that people who have been diagnosed (either professionally or by armchair) with NPD are aware of their behaviors and their effects.

My boyfriend is currently at the beginning stages of this 'awareness', I think. He's admitted he's beginning to realize that a lot of behaviors are in the vein of self-sabotage and has said he doesn't want to be like that. Example: anytime he realizes he's wrong, he gets extremely angry, and blames what he did on everyone and everything but himself - he's admitted this is a problem of his, he doesn't know why he gets so defensive, and wants to change.

I truly believe he isn't aware of a lot of what he's doing - I don't think he's intentionally behaving narcissistically most of the time. Sure, when he's at his most pissed off, he's admitted he intentionally says and does things he KNOWS are making things worse, but does it anyway. But most behaviors, such as initially responding with extreme anger and sarcasm when it's pointed out he did something wrong, is not something he was aware he was doing until after the fact.

Before he used to just go for days, unable to admit what he did. Now, he'll actually be able to admit what he did once he's calmed down from his initial response of anger and sarcasm.

If he does have NPD, I know it'll be a long road to recovery with a lot of ups and downs - if recovery is even possible. Or maybe it'll be more like a physical illness where you won't really ever be cured, and maybe that affects whether or not you can get through certain things in life smoothly vs having to do more work than most others - but that doesn't mean that the limitations of the illness means you deserve to be broken up with, right?

I don't want to give up on him. I truly think he's a good person and wants to be better, but he is kinda stuck on getting past whatever it is that's making him behave narcissically, only to realize it after he's calmed down some.

I really want to help. What can I do? What should I not do?

TL;DR: For NPDs who are aware and want to get better, what can those closest to you (esp your gf/bf) do to help? And by extension, not make things worse?",7
218,Fight Flight Fawn or Freeze?,11,a9q0o5,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/a9q0o5/fight_flight_fawn_or_freeze/,3,1545842422.0,"**The Fight Type and the Narcissistic Defense**

Fight types are unconsciously driven by the belief that power and control can create safety, assuage abandonment and secure love. Children who are spoiled and given insufficient limits (a uniquely painful type of abandonment) and children who are allowed to imitate the bullying of a narcissistic parent may develop a fixated fight response to being triggered. These types learn to respond to their feelings of abandonment with anger and subsequently use contempt, a toxic amalgam of narcissistic rage and disgust, to intimidate and shame others into mirroring them and into acting as extensions of themselves. 

The entitled fight type commonly uses others as an audience for his incessant monologizing, and may treat a ""captured"" freeze or fawn type as a slave or prisoner in a dominance-submission relationship. Especially devolved fight types may become sociopathic, ranging along a continuum that stretches between corrupt politician and vicious criminal. 

TX: Treatable fight types benefit from being psychoeducated about the prodigious price they pay for controlling others with intimidation. Less injured types are able to see how potential intimates become so afraid and/or resentful of them that they cannot manifest the warmth or real liking the fight type so desperately desires. I have helped a number of fight types understand the following downward spiral of power and alienation: excessive use of power triggers a fearful emotional withdrawal in the other, which makes the fight type feel even more abandoned and, in turn, more outraged and contemptuous, which then further distances the ""intimate"", which in turn increases their rage and disgust, which creates increasing distance and withholding of warmth, ad infinitem. Fight types need to learn to notice and renounce their habit of instantly morphing abandonment feelings into rage and disgust. As they become more conscious of their abandonment feelings, they can focus on and feel their abandonment fear and shame without transmuting it into rage or disgust - and without letting grandiose overcompensations turn it into demandingness.

Unlike the other 4Fs, fight types assess themselves as perfect and project the inner critic's perfectionistic processes onto others, guaranteeing themselves an endless supply of justifications to rage. Fight types need to see how their condescending, moral-high-ground position alienates others and perpetuates their present time abandonment. Learning to take self-initiated timeouts at the first sign of triggering is an invaluable tool for them to acquire. Timeouts can be used to accurately redirect the lion's share of their hurt feelings into grieving and working through their original abandonment, rather than displacing it destructively onto current intimates. Furthermore, like all 4F fixations, fight types need to become more flexible and adaptable in using the other 4F responses to perceived danger, especially the polar opposite and complementary fawn response described below. They can learn the empathy response of the fawn position - imagining how it feels to be the other, and in the beginning ""fake it until they make it."" Without real consideration for the other, without reciprocity and dialogicality, the real intimacy they crave will remain unavailable to them.

I've been having depressive episodes for awhile and firmly believe I'm incapable of empathy. Awhile ago some drama happened and it led to me being labelled a narcissist by a friend who had a narc Dad and a big argument. We don't talk to eachother anymore, for the better. Since I've come to conclusion that I may very well be one. I've tried doing various tests but I know there's no way to know for certain. Unfortunately I don't have the resources in the real world to get a proper diagnosis, as the money and experience just isn't in the area. However I've tried getting all the help I can irl and will continue to seek assistance. 

Why do I believe I'm a narcissist? Well I've noticed various traits have aligned with who I am quite well. I get jealous fairly easy especially in relationships, I lie and overadvertise my skills, I can have quite a build up of anger occur and sometimes at the wrong times I snap. I'm aware of myself having a social mask, sometimes I feel like I have no real self-esteem I feel just a little dead when by myself. I'm also quite the perfectionist and force myself to be the best I can sometimes not often being pleased with my efforts. 

Honestly the only way to put this is I'm a confused teenager(I'm aware I can't get a proper diagnosis at this age) one of the reasons I want to know if there's any hope for getting better is because I'm aware my brain is still developing and that if I have any hope now for change, this would be the time. I'm scared I see others as just extensions of myself, that I can't feel true lover and that I'm just a fake. I'd really appreciate some clarification on empathy, object constancy and whole-object relations, viewing someone as an extension and knowing if I have a real sense of self. Any of this would be deeply appreciated if anyone's willing to share their knowledge. Thank you all if anyone has any issues of their own they'd like to discuss I'm down to chat.

They said it sounded like narcissism, and I wanted to see if these things ring a bell.  Or if they at least ring as highly problematic.  

1.  Wanting to know every last detail about me, super interested in everything about me, and initiating texting like twelve times a day. (I was very responsive and flattered, albeit self consciously).  For some reason was always very encouraging of sharing everything with him, to never feel like I need to hold back.  Despite the intense interest bestowed upon me, he was mostly very vague about his feelings towards me, whereas I shared my feelings a few times.

2.  When I set a boundary to not stay in such constant contact (my work was suffering and I felt this growing dependency) they thought I was losing interest, gushed all their feelings for me, disagreed that it was necessary though ""understood"" (""If things are able to work out with us without constant contact then fucking awesome and yay!""), didn't change constant contact at all but continued as usual the next morning, planning our next date a week in advance.  I was responsive and just got swept away again.  (But I also didn't give him a week or so to really see if he was in fact ignoring me)

3.  When I brought up the weirdness surrounding the #2 very gently the next day....and what I perceive to be excessive fawning from #1, they became very defensive saying, ""I'm not some weak, fragile being"", ""I can love but I can cut a bitch out"", ""I don't build my being on you"".  Maybe his intense fawning wasn't that big a deal and I made it one?

4.  Contradictory about describing self and past.  Disorienting for me. (""My intense interest  towards people in the past can come off as obssession and I don't want that to be misunderstood"" vs. ""My lone wolf nature in the past has made people think I'm not interested, so I'm especially mindful of this."")

5.  After #3, suddenly acts like they didn't see us as dating but just ""fucking around"".   Questions my affections despite the fact that I had told him a few times that I really liked him, looked so much forward to seeing him every week, was always attentive to his contact.  That same night he implies he wants to move in together in the future literally the same day he says he just sees us as ""fucking around."".  (I mean, I would too if things developed and I decided I wanted to be in a relationship.  I was very serious about dating for the purpose of finding a long term partner.)

Everything was going pretty great until #2...and after #5, I brought up my concerns about how it seemed he was manipulating me...that his communication confused me.  After I said we should give it some time and thought, within three hours he said something strange like, ""Quit analyzing me, we agree that we should move on from the honeymoon phase and into something substantial.""  I certainly never used those words or agreed that things were moving that way.  I had simply expressed that I was serious about finding a partner, and that an infatuation phase is temporary.

 It seemed to get worse, and I completely broke and felt all this anger inside of me (which I'm not used to feeling) and I got over reactionary and told him that he didn't really care about me....painted him as a deceptive, manipulative person.  He didn't back down but kept maneuvering to keep me in his life, seemingly unaware of how any of the above was questionable.  Was I just making something out of nothing, projecting something, or intuiting something dangerous?

He asked me to think honestly of why I was reacting this way, once saying he felt he was triggering me....and I really thought hard about it and I couldn't think of some ulterior motive.  I felt scared and betrayed.

As I was cutting things off, he told me all these things that I still can't get out of my head 2 months later:

""You don't seem to be led by love""

""Love gives one strength"" (implying I was overreacting from apparently bad experiences in the past.  In the past he said a couple times how he admired my strength for moving on from a cult experience)

""Love makes someone vulnerable"" (implying that by cutting it off I was being invulnerable)

""Maybe the universe has something else planned for us.""

""You can be mean and blind"". (never expressed before that I was mean and blind)

""You aren't the only one who has suffering"" (I rarely shared suffering with him)

""You should embrace experiences while you're still young and able to."" (...........I'm 33?  What?)

""You have learned a lot, but you still don't know shit."" (Previously had said how frighteningly perceptive I was)

Etc.  He had never said things like this before, but only after I had challenged him.  After I had said it was over.  He told me he felt I was attacking his character, maybe he said all these things out of hurt.

A week later I felt terrible for how I had painted him as a manipulative person (however, I never went for his vulnerabilities...I accused more broadly)....I was scared I had abused him in some way or influenced him in a negative way...that, perhaps it was just insecurities or something, but not a real issue...and I apologized.  I had no interest in pursuing him any further.  He first said he ""of course"" forgave me, and then it devolved into how much I hurt him and that I was just apologizing to remove guilt so I could move on.  He also threw in a doubting I ever had feelings for him again, as the icing on top.

For four months this whole experience has consumed my mind and entire being.  I've felt so much guilt and shame and confusion.  I can't seem to decide if I did the right thing, which things I did right, this feeling of needing to atone to him, that he is a better and more advanced person than I will ever be, that I'm a crazy person, that I ruined something.  I feel like he could take what unfolded and easily say I was a toxic person for having become so hypervigilant against him at the end.",2

So yeah up until recently I acc had no clue I was narcissistic until someone pointed it out, even since I was younger I had inflated sense of self importance, but it was far more spiritual than physical. I had very low self esteem but I always believed my personality was great, it's fun, but I am probs too selfish. My sense of self worth only came recently after a long long string of rejection from boys which just emotionally fucked me a bit. Then gradually I started to gain this amazing self confidence and sort of appreciated my worth, started respecting myself more, and then even began seeing myself as better than others. But before I was wondering what was wrong with me and thinking I was not good enough for most people. Now I do feel empathy. Not for everyone. A lot of people no. But I feel such empathy for certain people, and also even if I don't. I still give advice to someone reaching out to me, but now I'm considering if that's just because I want to feel like a good person. I fall madly in love with people very quick, and sometimes I think yeah I want validation and affection - but a lot of people do. But I genuinely care about the people I love, I do love them and feel sad if I think I have upset them. I am so needy and feel anger and envy at others for having what I don't. But maybe others feel this too. I don't know. Some people just don't worry about what they feel and tackle life with physical action, while I go into my brain, analyse my feelings, analyse my thoughts, my reasons, my intentions, I need to know why I'm doing these things and make change if it's not helping me. If I'm a narcassict then I'm basically fucked because my life will change continue to be as problematic as it now and it's not too enjoyable. I notice always talking about myself I'm fucking obsessed, I mean not good things but like I'm just so concerned about myself all the Fucking time LIKE I'm so fucking "" precious"". I hate alone time I indulge into myself too much. I prefer to be with people and distract and feed off others energy and not my self. Even now just talking about myself on Reddit has made me furious and feel like shit I hate thinking and analysing myself sometimes I just wanna live in the fucking moment and laugh??????
Oh and also I'm attention seeking often. Very loud and am just known as an attention seeker, not intentionally.
I also get upset when people don't like me, and get angry and anxious when people can't see my potential. I am not controlling at all and value my friends and a lot of people in my life the exact same as me, and do not need to win an argument and all that malarkey. I have heard that I can be manipulative but have acc never even tried to manipulate someone, however I am aware that I can be very persuasive and can be quite hard on someone if they are frustrating me. I DONT WANNA BE A NARCASSIST I NEED TO BE ABLE TO EMPATHISE AND LOVE OTHERS AND CARE MORE I do not want to live my life so focused on myself and I even think that me not displaying some narcassitic traits is so that I don't look or think bad of myself, it's all in my head and thoughts that counts. 
  I think I'm just a very very confused teenager and have extreme overthinking skills. ",3
224,why do i feel angry at every one and why do i Want to devalue things??,2,8l0jso,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/8l0jso/why_do_i_feel_angry_at_every_one_and_why_do_i/,7,1526906858.0,"is this a narcissistic trait?? i simply feel angry at everyone because i automatically assume they can't and won't understand me. i have built so much walls to the point i see myself as a misunderstood rare gift from the world. i don't feel special but i do feel like no one can understand even if they tried to. i feel being misunderstood contributes to my anger. for example i just seem to devalue everything, today i went on the BPD sub and just had a urge to act mean and insult everyone there, i saw them talking about gaslighting and i thought to myself ''you're all the same pathetic filth pfft'' and then i felt angry at them and at the world. one minute i am for acceptance the next i am completely devaluing said thing and talking about it in such a disdainful way. i feel everything at the core is just pure shit, i sometimes get defensive thoughts like ''i should die'' when i get into this thinking. i pretty much have most BPD traits yet i am over here feeling so angry at the disorder and wanting to devalue everyone who has it. i feel i am subconsciously devaluing everything because it stems from the part of feeling misunderstood. i am not a misanthrope, i actually love going out and being around people but i just feel so angry at the world and certain groups, is this apart of the autism spectrum? or is it more related to BPD/NPD?",2
