0,How do I empathize with anger instead of being defensive/escalating?,avo1dant,13,qb8e4f,2021-10-19 10:09:32,10,"(Idk if I have npd, but this fits w symptoms)



When someone is angry at me and says things in a certain way, instead of listening to them I lash out and escalate the situation, making them even more upset. I was told that what I do is tone policing. I think I do this because I perceived it as an insult. I find it difficult to be sympathetic or understanding of someone when they snap at me, are short with me, are visibly annoyed, etc.",13
1,Anyone ever get in large social settings and just get upset for no reason violent tendencies or thoughts and anger this happens to me sometimes not always.,typicalmethead,8,rhl91y,2021-12-16 07:10:19,3,,8
2,Do you get angry or upset when you make a mistake?,synthshook,19,g19wr2,2020-04-14 17:31:44,7,"Even though I am self-aware in a situation like this, I sometimes get really pissed off when someone asks me something and I mess up answering their question. Like I misunderstood or missed part of a question, now it's my fault for giving an incomplete or wrong answer. It just makes me super angry at the person who put me in that position. The only thing that makes me feel better is if they themselves mess up horribly, or sometimes if I get to correct my mistake, otherwise screw them for cornering me like that and I hope they perish slowly and painfully.

I know there must be a better way to re-frame the situation, but it's unknown or unnatural to me.",19
3,I've realised I don't feel anger,Sufficient-Side,9,pqzus1,2021-09-19 02:46:54,22,"Hi,

Throwaway account for obvious reasons. Not diagnosed NPD but pretty sure I am, or at least have traits. 

As a kid and early teenager I was really naughty and I guess had a temper. Quite rebellious etc. Now I'm always trying to please people (to a fault). 

I've realised that as an adult, I never get angry. I'm not sure exactly when I stopped feeling anger. I do feel some other emotions (at least envy, self-pity, frustration and guilt) but noticeably anger is missing.

Can anyone else relate to this? I think anger is probably a healthy emotion to feel sometimes, so the fact I don't concerns me. Did anyone find anything that can help?",9
4,the pain of shame,majiira,11,r5u4o4,2021-11-30 18:41:00,6,"I want to ask for advice/perspectives/any help you can possibly give.

I am usually a pretty calm person but there are incidents where I can experience narcissistic rage. it's pretty rare and only happened twice in the past few years. but it's usually the same situation: I am vulnerable and trusting of someone and then I find out that person lied to me over a period of time and/or betrayed me with someone else.

something that anyone would be angry about I suppose. but the pain this specific situation brings me is so overwhelming, that it can almost immobilize me for a few days and usually drops me into a suicidal spiral and intense rage.
I don't let it out on anyone but it boils in me and kind of eats me from the inside

what hurts me the most is a) the fact that I was lied to and believed it and b) that there is another person they chose, that is ""better"" than me.

I'm pretty sure the reason this pain feels like it almost rips me apart physically is because the underlying emotion is shame. and thats like what npd is mostly based on.

the thing is, in these situations I have a very hard time coming out of it. when it happened in 2018 it took me about a year to function again. there was a S attempt and I had to go to a clinic for a few months. the anger only slowly subsided.

now I'm in a similar situation and everytime I think about it my nerves feel like they are filled with hot water. and thats basically constantly.

I am very angry but also resigned because I know I have no way to get ""justice"".

I try to deal with this in a logical way but as of right now it feels impossible. I can try to calm down a little but the second I think about it again the paralyzing pain comes back.

any tipps? insight? ways to deal with the chronic shame inside us?",11
5,"Rant. It’s difficult to both face anger issues and face narcissism, because I want to believe my anger is valid. Looking at it as a reaction to my childhood helps.",n0000onemustknow,11,o3teou,2021-06-20 00:17:40,9,"The other day I talked one on one to a family therapist. She suggested the role I was playing in my family growing up was to get upset about all the problems no one else was addressing. She said that by getting upset, I was actually doing the emotional work for them, so they didn’t have to deal with it (unconsciously ofc). They could say I was just crazy and completely ignore the problems at hand. This makes sense to me.

So. Apparently, I would lash out because of problems not being addressed due to neglect. So all these years, my anger has been valid...

But, it’s obvious my behavior and reactions to that anger is “inappropriate” and I HATE that word, because *i* feel my anger is appropriate. It makes me feel so invalidated. And yet, there’s obviously a problem. I want to face that problem without submitting to the idea that I’ve just been crazy. I want to feel valid. But it’s really hard when my family still treats me like I’m crazy. I’m SO sensitive, and yet I hate to say that because truthfully, I’ve just been gaslit into thinking that. 

But also...EVERYTHING upsets me. Tiny amounts of disrespect put me into a rage. I’m just so angry and exhausted. This stuff is so hard, but I think I’m improving slowly.",11
6,Is my irrational anger towards my bf potentially NPD?,wakaouji,15,hd1c75,2020-06-21 05:21:53,13,"I get really angry at my boyfriend when I'm trying to tell him something and I expect some kind of admiration or praise for it. I want him to tell me how interesting  what I said is but instead he always turns it to some other related fact about the topic. It's as if he wants to one up my fact about it with another fact of his. I don't think that's what he's intending to do but its how I feel. It pisses me off and I sit there annoyed trying to get him to acknowledge me but it never feels like he is. Is this potentially a sign of NPD? I'm really sensitive to criticism and I feel different from everyone else. Kind of like they all are able to connect with each other in a way I can't. I realize the relationships I like are ones where the other person admires me for some reason and I can't really get close to people otherwise (unless I'm involved romantically). I have a hard time being equal to someone else. I feel like I have to be in a position where they need me to help them or that they admire me. I don't know if I'm being irrational but I get really angry and hurt when it happens and I usually hang up then go on to say outloud how much I hate him to the empty room (even though I don't mean it)

I really don't know what's going on when I get angry. I know it doesn't make sense logically to get as upset as I do about it. I don't know if it's NPD or something else is wrong. Does anyone else feel this way?",15
7,"Get upset when people aren’t constantly chasing me and giving me attention, but ignore them and take them for granted when they do and only view them as an ego booster",anonymous19272,45,pigiqq,2021-09-05 16:45:25,25,"How the fuck do I fix this mindset?! I literally FEED off of admiration and being chased by others because it gives me a strong sense of self worth and superiority, something I feel I need otherwise I feel unimportant and worthless and that there’s something wrong with me. 

But this is the issue, when people are giving me this fuel, I don’t give them anything in return, usually I just ignore them, or give a little response and then drop it. 

This obviously in turn makes these people think I’m not interested and they leave me alone. But then I get upset that nobody’s paying me any attention and start to feel really lonely and angry like I’m entitled to all of this kind of attention and can’t understand why people aren’t giving me more.

I can’t stand this feeling, but it’s inevitable to avoid, and I mean it is absolutely impossible. This is why I limit the amount of people I come in contact with, so I don’t go insane on them and get myself into trouble caused by anger. The feeling of seeing someone having the upper hand on me eats me alive. At this point, all I care about is admiration and positive attention. I don’t know why, and I know these things only fuel my ego and nothing more. I wish I didn’t give a fuck about having people admire me, but I can’t. Do any of you all deal with this?

10,DAE have a fit of rage and then ruin things for themselves?,Peeperpants,22,pjqa1b,2021-09-07 16:17:23,11,"I get these ""fits"" where I completely can't control myself and get super passive aggressive. Then, after it passes, I massively regret it.
For example, yesterday was my birthday. I have no money and few hobbies, so I couldn't think of anything I wanted to do when my fiance asked. Since I had no ideas, he decided that in the morning we would take his little brother fishing, then mayne do something else. I was secretly hoping that when the morning came, he would decide he didn't want to go fishing, and would rather stay home, but I couldn't tell him that because he had already made all the preparations and I didn't want him to be upset at me. Morning came, I went with them, and I was angry and nasty the whole time because he didn't read my mind and realize I wanted us all to stay home and cancel the trip. After we got home, I wanted his brother to go home, but there was nobody home to watch him so he had to stay with us, so I got mad again and hid in the bedroom watching tv by myself.
During these episodes of anger, I felt that I was totally rational and had been wronged. After they passed (the next morning) I realized that I had just been upset for no reason and had not only made everyone else miserable, but I had completely destroyed my own birthday.

Does anyone else get these episodes of anger that feels completely justified until after it passes and then you realize it's completely wrong? How do you try to realize that you are wrong and shut it down before having a meltdown?",22
11,am I being narcissistic or I'm right about being upset with apathetic partner?,StockList2223,3,rvaip7,2022-01-03 20:00:20,4,"I'm in my 30s and I have a malignant mother that has destroyed our family. Growing up I realized I picked up some of her traits like inner insecurity, passive aggressiveness, mild entitlement and occasional self centeredness. My partner of 3 years hasn't always been the most open or social individual, for examples we never had a proper trip because he hates travelling, gifts/surprises are mostly mine (I gave him his christmas present but haven't got mine yet) even if he really doesn't care about these things so he wouldn't mind if I didn't get him anything.He's quite apathetic and most of the things we might have done together I ended up doing on my own. He's very upset every time I make him notice how wrong everything is and how hurtful it can be for me, but he just can't seem to understand, he says he's never asked me to be different or change, so I just should accept that he's like this. It's still beyond me and not getting the attention (that I think I deserve) makes me cry first, then rage, even if I avoid raging at him. But I'm super miserable and unhappy because of this.

13,I'm angry for treating myself like a garbage,Miss_miserable_,16,pzlhc4,2021-10-02 01:16:06,1,"Everyday I feel drawn to my enviness and anger, I feel bitter and mean with everyone. Maybe I don't show it but inside I hate people, I hate how much they lack self awareness, how they don't recognize their mistakes, how dumb they are, how they judge everyone.

And yes I feel that I'm better than them but at the same time I hate myself for that. Because no matter my feelings inside, I'm nice, I always try to be respectful and I can't understand why others can't be.

I ditch myself everyday because I think that I'm narcissist and that for that I must feel guilty. That be a npd makes me monster and I'm the wrong one, I'm sick and I need fixing.

But then I see all these assh*les around me feeling proud about things that they don't even have, feeling that they are smart, beautiful, successful when they are just garbages who happens to lack any sense of empathy and being lucky in their lives while I always try tyo humble myself to the point that I invalidate me completely. I torture myself by overthinking my feelings and try to control me because I'm scared of being bad person while others are just ruthless and take advantage of everyone. I'm not good person but at least I know that I didn't use anyone ever.

I feel so angry because I see so many people on this sub blaming theirselves for their actions and maybe indeed they did something bad I don't really know but nobody recognizes the fact of how so many others have good time because they never feel remorse.

I'm confused if they are narcissists or sociopaths or just d*cks who only care about theirselves what I know is that self awareness and self improvement is a bunch of bullshits. I wish I could be like them use people and believe all the time that I'm the greatest of all not punishing me for feeling that I'm better in things that are obvious. I wish I could be delusional and believe that I never hurt anyone or im the prettiest girl in the world or I'm capable for things I'm clearly not.

And no it's not confidence to not care at all about what people say about you. Yes it's not healthy to depend your life on others people's opinions but to not care about what others say to you it's not good. It's not healthy to just only focus on you completely and forget others. We live in a society and it's logical to see what others do or to worry if they are better from you. I don't understand why things like ""I'm this, person and I don't change"" ""I don't care what others say"" considered healthy but if you are envious and jealous, or people annoy you you are the wrong one. Both approaches are wrong.

I'm tired treating myself bad because I msfe the mistake to believe that I have actually better traits and more depth than others. I'm tired hold my critisism and be judgmental inside me when others give they unsolicited opinions for everyone openly. Whatever I'm, I'm a person and I deserve to have a good life. I never hurt anyone intensionally, I never use anyone and I never told lies. Just because my thoughts are mean diesbt mean that I'm a bad person. And yes I have the right to be proud of myself for all those thinks and not be afraid that I will offend someone with my position. 

I'm sure that someone will come and tell me that it's like I think I deserve more than someone who is actually manipulative. You know what? I'm tired always take in consideration what the other side would think. I would never tell to someone that I deserve something more but I can't be afraid all the time to be proud of myself. Yes I want to feel proud for being a good person or I'm prude or I never cheat etc. I'm tired humble me down all the time. I hate myself for always have this voice in my head that saying but think about the other side, you lay offebs them. Nobody ever take into consideration my side so why should I continue do that? To be a descend person? 

Probably you will judge me for my statements a d probably they confirm that I'm a narcissist. But I don't care anymore I'm so done with life in general. Maybe people here online are more self aware but in real life things are different. It makes me mad seeing all these people in every mental sub suffer amdcstruuggje and feeling bad for even thinking that they may be narcissists or bad people just because they feel envy or something. And I'm mad with all these therapists who try to fix you and make you feel like the wrong one. Nobody in my opinion who is aware of his mistakes and feel bad about them and wants to change is the actual problem. The problem is all these monsters around us who bieve that they are the best and having the best time because they never did some self critisism while others like me we blame ourselves to the point of neglect. 

It's a very tupical npd thinking what I do right now by blaming the world end not me for my thoughts? It may seem this way but if it was actually true I wouldn't be here, wasting my time by hating me, I wouldn't want to die, i would be out there brag about how great I'm without caring if others agree with me. Sooner or later my gradiosity episode will end and I will return to my shameful state of mind of feeling like I'm the worst person and I don't have the right to believe that I'm better or different from others around me even if it is obvious.",16

This never happens, because I know even if my brains telling me is right, it's actually  wrong. I don't want to hurt anyone, so I deal with  confrontations like any other person would the best I can. I fear that these reactions leak out without me realizing though since i still do get in trouble surrounding those types of things and I don't even notice I said something like that until its brought up. and I wish it didn't happen at all, or at the very least ended after a minute. It goes on forever and I may never be over it. Same with when I'm comfronting someone about an Issue i have with what they did to me, I immediately want to bombard them with  shoving my own insecurities and claims into their mouth   and get pissed at them for thinking they're better than me, but again I know it's wrong and so i restrain myself, and in some shitty sense it kinda sucks having to stop doing something when you genuinely think its right.

It bothers me so much having to mask and keep in all of this bullshit  just so i can have a normal conversation  with someone and value what they say.  Does anyone else have advice for controlling this rage? Should I just immediately ask for some space to breathe until I calm down?",5

19,Unpopular opinion: codependents are toxic as shit,reverent_blu,17,plwoka,2021-09-11 00:01:23,37,"I have a codependent in my life, and I’m really done with his shit at this point. These people have just as much toxic anger as narcissists but they stow it away until it explodes. And when it does, they want you to feel pain believe me. The codependent person I know admitted to me that when he was angry, he wanted me to feel exactly the way he does at that point. (Like shit, destroyed.) It’s like he doesn’t even recognize me at that point.

And when they do get upset, it’s usually a result of something simple you did that triggered their mountainous trauma that they refuse to face because they’re so busy being the victims and feeling depressed for themselves. And even worse, they feel the full range of guilt and shame and then they’ll blame that on you too when THEY lash out at you, because they can’t handle feeling it themselves. Many of them can’t handle being seen as an angry person so all the anger is blamed on me. 

When they get angry it’s full on abuse. They also project all their insecurities onto you during fights as well and telling you that you’re making them feel like a burden or abandoning them, when you didn’t say that at all.

They also basically can’t do barely anything for themselves and expect others to do it and when others don’t they get panicky and controlling. Then they are “horrified” by why people avoid them or why the help is never enough and why “no one cares”. They also won’t even ask for help in the first place because they’re embarrassed but then just magically expect you to know what they need.

20,I don't know if I am a narcissist or not,Thesadstrangetomato,5,pn9xl3,2021-09-13 06:25:05,43,"Ok so I think I may have NPD or some traits of it. I will list some reasons why I think I may have NPD:

1. I HEAVILY rely on fantisies ( I actually think about myself like this almost all the time) so I can idealize myself.
2. I go from thinking I am better than everyone and comparing myself to other people to thinking I am worthless and deserve to die or something like that
3. If there is one thing that I heavily base my self esteem off of (smarts, being able to make anyone like me ) that turns out not to be true, I have a breakdown. Like, I literally feel SOOO uncomfortable with myself and because of this, I can't go into my fantasy world which I need/use so much, making the breakdown all the more worse.
4. I had an upbringing where my parents fought all the time (tried to kill each other, but for awhile I got used to it), I was in contact with the legal system all the time) I felt like my mom looked down on me ( in a pitying oh she's so pathetic, poor thing way) and my dad relied on me for emotional support like there was no tomorrow ages 6-11 ( also called parentification) and neglected me from the ages of 0-5. When ever I testified in court ( I was 11 when I testified, about the time my parents got the most violent towards each other) about who I would live with, my mom and dad ( in a much more covert way) CONSTANTLY guilt-tripped me into picking them ( I remember a conversation with my mom and I had after I went out with my dad, she basically said that I was a bad person for ""choosing dad"", I was 10 by the way.
5. I had serious codependecy issues when I was 10, I ""dated"" someone who was abusive and said things like ""go fuck yourself"" toward the end ( he felt insulted) when my mom broke up with him for me (over text, so he thought it was me). And then he went off to his little friends and a called me a bitch and told his friends his version of the story to make them hate me, it worked. I was bullied, but in a different way than you expect ( spreading rumors, gossiping about me). All of this made me develop social anxiety and being paranoid and distrustful.
6. When I was 11 I felt like a completely different person, like a switch had been flipped. I was VERY envious, angry, resentful, very easily offended, had a serious victim complex, wrathful, and hateful. I was angry because I felt like the world was against me, that someone like that could win and I would always lose, that everything I wanted depended on people who had all the power in the world against me, that people could do whatever they wanted to me and they would never be punished, not even by me.....
7. When I was 11 1/2  the issues above continued but I had one more thing to deal with, on top of him and his friends, severe depression and suicidal thoughts. I had to deal with these because I was grieving over the loss of a childhood that I never had and never will, but I couldn't face that fact, I turned to delusions.
8. When I was 12 I had assigned myself the mission of defeating him (socially). But it was different than from the time I had been 11 1/2, it was like another switch had been flipped, one of constant happiness seeking, and self- esteem ( more like grandiosity) seeking. I was not depressed, I was not hateful, I did not feel unloved, I felt no pain, I just felt high. High from everything I had been doing to feel good, high because in my mind, if could be just as bad as him (which made me feel good), I could be his equal ( because he taught me that was what an equal was), we could be bad together, I thought.
9. My empathy works a little different: Whenever I see someone who is going through what I went through, I have empathy, but I have to be in their emotional state myself at the exact same time, otherwise I have no idea what they are feeling and cannot empathise.   Or, I am going through a breakdown and disregard other people's emotions.
10. I think of myself in the 3rd person often (""oh she's so amazing"")
11. I feel attacked and lash out at people who make feel socially stupid ( I am EXTREMELY insecure about this, and will literally think of killing myself if I feel like that).
12. I self harm and have mood swings
13. I have a lot of paranoia sometimes
14. I like it when people feed my victim complex.
15. I feel entitled to be mean and passive aggressive when I'm angry.
16. I feel VERY uncomfortable with love and confessing any emotion to anyone.
17. I don't percieve someone as the same person I normally would when I am angry with them.
18. I go from idealizing other people and not thinking highly of them quickly
19. I have a very unstable view of other people, if they do one thing that looks even a little suspicious, I question their entire character.
20. Sometimes when I have breakdowns, I question my sanity, my view of reality and my character
21. feelings of emptiness",5

23,What's the Deal with Masking?,ImperiousAnarchist,6,roj4d4,2021-12-25 22:40:18,14,"I feel like many people on this subreddit have this neurosis about masking.

I don't understand why. Masking is needed for our kind of society to function. If your boss pisses you off at work by assigning you to work over the weekend, you don't curse out your boss. You suck it up, smile, and work. Well, you can quit or organize a union, but that's for another day. ;)

Likewise, you narcissistic peeps have to cover up your grandiosity, envy, or whatever. That's not bad. That's just a survival skill. If you get entitlement rage, are you gonna display your anger and drive people away? Of course not.

Be advised that *masking* is similar but different from *image management*. You can manage your image through masking negative feelings. That way, people won't think you're neurotic. I suppose that masking is a technique that helps you manage your image.

It started with much more frequent and more violent fantasies of hurting whoever upset me and often ends in killing that person either by choking them or stomping on their skull until nothing's left of it and while i hope to know that I could bever do it in real life, these fantasies are so cathartic to me  even though it's objectively messed up and I know I need to talk to someone about this but haven't had the chance. I also feel nervous about sharing this information because I don't want to get in trouble for this, there's also the worry about how I'll be judged by whoever I tell (in part because looking at me from the outside no one could guess that I'm this angry inside).

The fantasies aside It's also much harder to control my actions when I'm angry. Not getting what I want when I was sure I'd get it resulted in damaging some property pretty badly and the police got called on me. I've never had trouble with law enforcement before so I didn't get charged with vandalism but if anything similar happens again I'd get in trouble and I don't want that even though it felt good kicking the shit out of this object until it broke (not specifying because I don't wanna be identified through that)

Thing is I know that in that case I was frustrated because I was stressed and feeling disappointed and maybe even hurt, but it still came out as anger. Then again, I know that even if I managed to express these original feelings it wouldn't help anyway so that fuels the rage even more! I think 'they're against me anyway, they don't want to listen or help' and past experiences actually helped solidify those thoughts...

In the end though I don't want to have all this anger and emotional decadence. I don't want things to slowly build up like and then rapidly be let out like some sort of inner helter skelter.
But what can I even do about it? It feels like it's out of my control at this point and  I feel helpless",3
26,I pissed off an NPD...is there hope?,Nycticorvax,2,kq30ui,2021-01-04 06:27:26,12,"I got into an argument with an NPD and was visibly angry with her. Now she has completely written me off, cut me off, and refuses to communicate. I have extensively apologized, made phone calls, and written letters. No matter what I try, she is unwilling to cooperate with me.

 Is there hope for our relationship? Or is it doomed forever?

 Any advice on how to seek a resolution with an NPD who is scorned?",2
27,I'm a good person. I'm a goddamn communal,VisualExtra,18,rkm1f4,2021-12-20 12:18:52,6,"I have to write it down so that I can remember. I need to stop having different opinions about myself everyday.

Taking the whole of me into account, I'm a good person -- and not a criminal, not an abuser, not a monster, not a sociopath.

And I'm not forgetting things here. I'm not trying to make up excuses nor rationalize mistakes of the past. I fucked up a lot.

Firstly, each time I fucked up - it was mostly self-sabotaging. I'd damage or get out of relations with people who were beneficial to me -- like friends, who are necessary for the sake of good mental health. It's obvious that I did not want to work against my own self-interest and I hated myself for ruining things.

**We can't blame the disorder for our actions, but only disordered people do self-sabotaging things compulsively.**

Secondly, I have to be realistic and think in terms of statistics. I ""narc abused"" maybe one or two people. In my defense, I also contributed a lot to their lives. I immediately began asking the question ""why am I sometimes going batshit crazy"". Kinda became conscious and avoided socializing for years.

**I did almost nothing that I could get arrested for. No crime that would have an impact on others or would be considered ""immoral"".** Never beat anyone, never threatened, never blackmailed. Intimidating someone is another story, but only in retaliation or self-defense. Drug abuse does not count.

Things like tax-evasion are in the grey area, but struggling to make ends meet is a mitigating circumstance. And it's the goddamn cultural norm.

I made hopes for some people. I considered them ""temporary"" friends. Disappointed or abandoned them. That's the thing that pisses me off about myself. From another perspective, I entertained them for a few months.

I looked at people as objects. Fuck me for having no empathy. I sometimes fuck up because logical thinking is not the best way to approach humans.

**I make up for the lack of empathy by thinking. I do ""checks"" and heuristics.**

It fucks me up sometimes. In the past, I tried to help someone. I knew that they might get pissed off by what I was about to do. But those things are hard to process for me, so I resorted to rational thinking. If I do what I want to do, will I cause them any damages or loss? Would I be considered strange or weird? No, so they shouldn't get angry. Well, guess what - they got angry as fuck. 

**All in all, I’m not a bad guy. Maybe not amiable. Definitely not malignant.**",18
28,"So fucking confused. Breakups suck, fuck me fuck her fuck everyone",Paganistic_Emperor,8,rk5hth,2021-12-19 20:53:35,9,"Just venting to like minded people don't mind me. 

So recently I went through a ""breakup"". We weren't officially dating which makes it even more humiliating that I feel like this but whatever. It wasn't super long lasting but it was the first time in a long time I allowed myself to try and be involved with someone. Obviously it didn't work out. 

I was a mess for a couple days. Self isolated and all that jazz. I thought I loved her there for a sec, then I texted my BPD ex out of a need for attention under the guise of ""closure"" (shitty I know. But I wasn't even 100% sure of my intentions at the time.) And when she started gushing how she'll always love me and all that shit it made me almost completely forget my last girl. Of course that didn't last for too long. Unfortunately people only shower you with affection for a little bit. Since then I've been doing anything I can for attention and admiration. Hooked up with a girl at a party last night and it didn't fucking help the way I wanted it to and I'm pissed. Why does she keep popping back into my mind? I'm not used to this. 

Been lashing out a lot more than I usually do. It's too humiliating to actually tell people I'm suffering right now. I'm so angry at myself and others. I just wish they'd see how desperate I am for attention. But I know that's my own fault. I wish my own intentions were more clear in the moment. But I don't even see what I'm doing until after.

I stopped dating out of fear of hurting others. I really didn't consider that I might be the one that got hurt. So pathetic ugh I'm pissed. I'm an idiot. 

Obviously I'm not looking for any sympathy or pity. Maybe attention who knows. But how do you guys get over shit like this? I'm very confused cause I haven't experienced this in a long long time. Fucking humiliating. I'm all over the place I apologize.",8
29,getting a npd diagnosis,friendlyloon,7,rwe4cv,2022-01-05 04:31:11,4,"hi guys. I made a post in the BPD subreddit:

>idk this is weird. I've been diagnosed with BPD since I was 17 (I'm 21), and I have agreed with the diagnosis until a few months ago. but whenever I see or hear people talk about their experience, they're an emotional, empathetic, and kind person. Like, they love and feel so much. I am not like this. I feel like I don't have emotion towards others or empathy. it's actually something I struggle with a lot. I don't care about people. but I do have BPD...? I have most of the symptoms, but I don't idolize people (or, have a favorite person). I feel like I manipulate and manipulate and manipulate and don't care about those around me. I only like someone if they like me. they give and I don't have the capacity to give back. symptoms wise, I feel mostly dissociative, grandiose, and impulsive behaviors. I also have delusions and angry outbursts, which I call 'raving episodes'. I'm kind of always living in a daydream and I get angry when people talk to me or engage with me. I like being alone, because I simply do not care about people. and this is sad to say, but my friends are my friends, but I don't have a lot of emotions towards them. when they're upset I just sort of shut down. like what do I do? I don't care that you're crying. is this normal for someone with BPD? or should I ask my doctor to reevaluate me?

That's what I wrote. I am wondering if I should get reevaluated and look into a NPD diagnosis. What do you guys think? no matter what I'm talking to my therapist, I just want to see if this has any backing. I'm tired of living like this and want to change my behavior.",7

31,Dealing with anger outbursts,mercury__girl,5,pr8h3e,2021-09-19 14:00:41,0,"Hi,

What are everyone’s tips for dealing with anger outbursts that stem from entitlement?

I always regret whenever I have one and am repulsed by my behaviour as it reminds me of my father, who has this inherent sense of insolent pride.

Yet I don’t know any techniques that can help me when I’m in these situations.

I seem to have no shame in raising my voice or making someone feel fear if I feel I’ve been wronged, slighted or if someone has done their job incompetently.

E.g today I thought the bus driver lost my suitcase and I went insane, turns out it was somewhere else and I could’ve just remained calm.

The ‘scene’ that I made was definitely beyond what was needed.
It’s like in those moments I’m running on something I can’t control.

This is maybe not a good example as it could be written off as mere anger issues and not NPD, but it’s the way in which I treat people as if they’re not human — people I don’t even know.

I have seen therapists before although not specifically for anger management, I know that would be a good logical step, but I wondered if anyone had has some practical tips or resources to share?

Thanks",5

34,Does it sound like I have Covert NPD? (18+),Tricky-Chocolate-836,7,pmjei3,2021-09-12 01:19:21,2,"Hey guys, I’m posting to this subreddit because I feel like I have covert NPD. I’m not in therapy or anything but I’m in the process of finding a therapist. I know obviously I won’t know until I see a therapist but I’m curious what other people think. These are the following symptoms I’ve experienced that I can think of at the moment:

- I’m very selfish and focus on myself and how I look or are perceived yet I also hate myself and think I’m disgusting, I’m also disgusted by my behavior but I can’t control how I feel in certain situations 

- extremely displaced anger, I also have difficulty taking no for an answer 

- I get obsessions with romantic partners, non-stop talk about them, get upset when they leave, I know that’s a bpd trait 

- I push people away because I feel bad for how I act 

- I feel like I deserve the bad things that come to me 

- I try to make myself look smarter than I am but I’m actually really dumb

- I’m overly sexual, which I know is an hpd trait

- manipulative and want things out of people

- black and white thinking

- very erratic and impulsive also have emotions that are all over the place

- sometimes have to mask how I feel

- this probably goes with displaced anger but I hate everybody and I’m angry with everything, at least recently, but I’ve also been very stressed out 

- I should mention I do have extreme ocd and I also disassociate but I don’t feel as if those fully affect why I act the way I do. I also have a parent clinically diagnosed with npd that didn’t seek treatment. (Granted diagnosis was from a sibling but she has her doctorate in psychology)

- I want to fall in love with somebody so bad but I don’t feel as if I could treat my partner correctly. When my last partner wouldn’t contact me I’d freak out and also gaslight them. I didn’t notice my behavior until later on. 

- I’m shy and I hate the spotlight but my brain tells me I want attention from everybody, it’s weird 

- I talk bad behind peoples backs/gossip 

- upset when I don’t get what I want 

- easily hurt and offended. Difficult receiving criticism 

- compulsive lying 

- difficulty admitting fault but overly apologetic 

- self harm occasionally 

- I know this is wrong but I’m critical of other people internally. Like in my head my brain goes oh this person is embarrassing I don’t want to be seen with them etc. including romantic partners. 

- I just don’t feel like I fit in with people generally

- I have suicide bated before, specifically with my mother. I didn’t in the moment see it as suicide baiting. I would just sort of do it out of anger. I would honestly hurt her feelings a lot and I didn’t care. Until I really noticed what I was doing. I don’t know if it’s my possibly npd or disassociating from my feelings or a mixture of both. But I know myself enough that I wouldn’t want to admit to it being npd so. 

I overlap with a lot of cluster b traits, I know for sure I don’t have ASPD though because I feel a LOT of guilt, mainly from my ocd. 

It’s also difficult to admit that I think I have npd, I know that’s a trait as well. It sucks because I want to be a good person and I want to change I just don’t know how and it’s difficult. Sorry for this being so long, umm but yeah. I never know how to end Reddit posts but thank you guys in advance for your advice. I really appreciate it.",7
35,Is reassurance due to fear of abandonment and trust issues a narcissistic tendency?,ravensparrow,2,rqdrgd,2021-12-28 11:26:42,6,"To start off: I’m not asking for a diagnosis. And I’m almost sure I don’t have NPD since I can’t relate to 100% of anything about its symptoms but I won’t straight up say I don’t have it because I don’t want to be “that person”. I’ve been a victim of narcissistic abuse before and have been routinely gaslight throughout my life and relationships so I’m weary of what I’m told and whatnot.

My husband wanted to show me a youtube video on the differences between traditional narcissism and covert/non-traditional narcissism specifically for the covert narcissist section that explains their traits (to which he later explained) because I’m friends with someone who carries those traits and I could never really pinpoint what exactly felt off about them and why they did the things they did.

In the video (it was a Dr K video, he’s the psychiatrist on Twitch), 1 of the many traits/symptoms of the covert narcissist is “reassurance”, and my husband pointed out that I tend to ask for reassurance sometimes which in his words “is a narcissistic trait”. I explained to him that my need for reassurance comes from a place of abandonment and trust issues, and that for example my reassurance 97% of the time is when I say something like: “Are you mad at me?”,  because I’m genuinely worried he is mad at me sometimes and it’s not “just to say it”; in my relationship with him it sometimes feels like I’m walking on eggshells because I need to be careful what I say or do in order to not upset him depending on how his mood is, because when he does get angry/frustrated it can get really bad (not physical, just verbal).

He claimed I was being defensive when I calmly explained to him I did not think it is a narc tendency or that it comes from a place of narc (as if it’s implied I am a narc) and he said he wasn’t downright calling me a narcissist or that the tendency is inherently narcissistic. I had trouble understanding the term “narc tendency” as well since it wasn’t explained properly. I kind of started doubting and questioning myself afterwards that it may very well be a narc tendency and asked him again his thoughts on what he claimed and he said “I don’t know if it’s a narc tendency or if it comes from a narc place I just wanted to say that”, and I started to have anxiety because it just felt like he planted a seed of doubt in my head; I suffer from CPTSD, OCD, ADHD, ASD, (and possibly schizo-affective/psychosis due to a cannabis-induced psychosis I had last year) and it just gave me a full-blown anxiety attack.

I’ve had times where I’ve asked myself before if I was a narcissist and I’m actually not an empath even when I feel a lot for others, mainly because of my issues concerning reality. I’m seeing a therapist and psychiatrist at the moment and I’m going to tell them about this but my appointment is so far and I’ve just been up all night worrying about this and kinda freaking out so that’s why I’m coming on here to ask for a third-party opinion.

I told my husband how that seed of doubt kinda messed me up and although frustrated he apologized and said that he didn’t mean to. Other things happened and topics were discussed that I might touch on later, but that’s pretty much what happened and I’m questioning my reality right now and pretty much my whole life.",2

Made the other huge mistake of googling my current issue, which as we all probably know by now, simply resulted in hundreds of articles about the effects of narcissistic abuse, what monsters narcs are, how to spot a narc, etc etc etc. Meanwhile I was trying to actually find articles ABOUT narcissism and self help, not about the victims of it. It's especially nauseating since everyone's taken to claiming their ex is a narcissist and overusing the term Gaslighting, and these articles just feed these people. 

(I felt compelled to Google something like ""repulsion fatigue"" because I'm dealing with a long time customer in my small business right now that is so persistent and annoying I've literally started imagining her being hit by a bus or something. She's done nothing wrong but she's so goddamn constant with her messages that I literally have lost all patience toward her and only interact with her for the consistent money flow. To any normal person I'm sure the level she's messaging me would be a little unusual but manageable, for me every time I hear the message ping I want to throw my phone across the room lol. I'm so exhausted.)

How does one not absorb this messaging and sift through the crap to find something useful? I avoid researching generally because the resources available just make me so angry and upset.",29
38,"The ""Silent treatment"" as an act of self control",-TraumaQueen,17,qj7fd8,2021-10-30 18:26:49,19,"This is both a question, and a collective rambling of thoughts. 

Silent treatment generally isn't my go-to. I'm pretty aggressive, and I'm pretty loud when I'm upset. Lately though, I've been trying really hard to sit with my rage, and to pick it apart as finely as I can, to establish the core reasons/thoughts that lead to my behavior. I've found that most times it has to do with control (will give details on that in another post another time) but when I can't figure out the root, the rage just kind of sits there, and stays, and it seems my best bet to prevent conflict and an explosion, is to be silent. 

Because if I say something to whoever my rage is directed at, it's going to be something mean. I'm probably going to degrade them, blame them, tell them off, whatever.  Internally I feel pissed, like pressure waiting to be released, so to not release that on a person that I'm unsure is deserving of it, is somewhat of a favor to them. 

Which got me wondering (and distracting myself) about whether other people do ""the silent treatment"" because they know that nothing good can come from talking, so they're practicing self control that's unrelated to the other person, or is it always as some sort of punishment towards the other person?",17

I get really angry when people I consider beneath me in looks show romantic/sexual interest in me. I have someone interested who I thought was happy to just be friends whose behaviour is now beginning to border on harassment, but that’s not even what bothers me. It’s that he’s overweight, not attractive facially, has questionable hygiene and is autistic (before anyone accuses me of ableism I myself have Aspergers, I’m just uninterested in dating another person with it or regular autism - I’ve always been more drawn to neurotypicals and think two people on the spectrum together seems like a terrible idea). He also doesn’t have my ambition and intellect and those are the 2 things I prioritise most in a prospective partner (also money lol).

I should stress it’s not just annoyance I feel by this but pure rage. I have been having a lot of dark thoughts about this person as a result.

42,My therapist just told me that I no longer have a personality disorder. Here's a summary of the past ~ 2 years of recovery,i-beat-hot-men,405,lkodju,2021-02-15 22:02:30,59,"I first started therapy in May 2019 due to suicidal ideation and depression. At the time, I didn't know that those were symptoms of my NPD. I was officially diagnosed with NPD in March 2020, but it's likely that I suffered from it most of my life. 

Recently, my therapist told me that I no longer fit the criteria of someone with a personality disorder. I have requested a few tests to confirm this news. Regardless, I have made significant progress since I first started therapy and I wanted to share my growth with everyone. 

**Note: this is not therapeutic/clinical advice. This is just my personal experience and what has personally helped me.** 

Now, straight to it.

&#x200B;

**Pre-NPD diagnosis**

***Suicidal Ideation, Control, Anxiety***  
The first order of business was dealing with my suicidal ideation. After many conversations with my therapist and introspection, I learned that it was a coping mechanism. I was trying to control my anxiety with the comfort of knowing that I have 'a way out'. It was also exacerbated with black-and-white thinking that always resulted in extreme choices (i.e. suicide). So if I wanted to take a risk that would cause me anxiety, I would think ""Whatever, I could always just kill myself"". This would make me feel calmer, but it would repress my anxiety instead of dealing with it. It was a final act of rebellion that no one could take from me. This need for control also manifested in different ways. For example, I would feel like I had to do everything myself. I wouldn't trust anyone with important information, jobs, chores, etc. I would also always act invulnerable and unbreakable to keep my emotions in control.

I had to let go of this need for control. I started this by being more vulnerable to the trustworthy people in my life. It was so difficult. I felt weak, ashamed, and powerless every time I honestly opened up to someone. I would even be thinking of those conversations days later and regretting every word. I would imagine them thinking less of me, feeling embarrassed for me, or even making fun of me. But I knew I had to do it. This was for me, after all. Slowly, those feelings began to fade. I started to feel more confident about my emotions, and my relationships with my friends and family started to get better. I noticed that they started to open up to me too. It felt like by opening up to them, I gave them the green light to do the same. It felt good to have someone that trusts me with this kind of stuff.

&#x200B;

**Post-NPD diagnosis**

***Denial, Dishonesty, Self-Image***  
This happened at the start of the pandemic, which was very convenient for me. I had so much free time to work on myself, and I was forced to be alone with my thoughts much of the time. After asking them multiple times, my therapist finally diagnosed me with NPD. It felt like a death sentence. I couldn't believe it. I kept thinking of all the times where I thought I displayed empathy. ""What about that one time I comforted a crying stranger in the street"", or ""How come I felt sad when my cat was hurt?"", or ""Why do I feel bad when I see a disabled person?"". Of course, this was all conditional empathy. But, I am a scientist, and I had to get this information from a source that I can 100% trust. So, I went on Google's scholarly articles section and searched articles on NPD.

After much reading, I realized that the NPD diagnosis did fit my profile. As much as I wanted to pretend I wasn't Narcissistic, I knew I shouldn't fall into the trap of denial that some of the case studies referenced. I cried a lot that night. The next day, I swore that I would be as honest as possible with myself, and with my therapist, no matter how shaming the truth is. I didn't mind lying to everyone else, though. I just saw no point in being dishonest with myself and with someone that I'm paying to help me.

So, during my next session, I told my therapist every single emotion I felt since our last interaction. It was horrifying. I felt the image I built over my entire life crumble to pieces. All the lies I told my therapist were now obvious. I was ashamed of how weak I sounded. I was worried of what they might be thinking of me. I wanted to break down and cry after every sentence. Despite that, I related all my experiences so my therapist can help me in the best way possible. I then managed a genuine apology for how I treated them the past year. I can't begin to tell you how difficult that apology was. It felt like my chest was tightening after every word. I later learned that this sensation was just a tiny reflection of the overwhelming guilt I felt for everything else I've done in my life. 

I learned an important lesson during that session: I should always be honest with myself. Otherwise, I risk building up a fake self-image that will become tougher to shatter as I progress in life. Better to rip the bandage now.

So, I started keeping a private journal where I could be completely honest with my thoughts and feelings. I paid particular attention to some of the doubtful things I did throughout the day. Example: *Did I just try to manipulate that person when I said that irrelevant fact? Why did I exaggerate about my accomplishment to my friend just now? Am I purposefully trying to make my mom upset by ignoring her?* I would then have an honest discussion about those thoughts with my therapist. Session after session, I challenged myself to be more vulnerable with my therapist. This lead me to realize that they didn't care that I had a 'dark side'. They just wanted to help. They were happy to feel trusted and they were glad I was utilizing their hard-earned skillset and knowledge. I also found myself caring less about what they thought of me. Not in an arrogant sort of way. Rather, it was in an unconcerned sort of way. It felt good. I started to understand that most people don't think of my flaws as much as I think of them.  


***Guilt, Victim Mentality***  
With this newfound awareness came a price. The more aware I became of my actions, the guiltier I felt. I would feel so guilty from all the times I've manipulated people, even unintentionally. I felt guilty about my streak of lies and broken promises. I felt particularly guilty about how exploitative I was of my family. I remember recklessly spending my money and then making up reasons and excuses so my family would send me more money than I needed. And they did. Not because they're doormats, but because I constantly victimized myself and I knew how to manipulate their emotions and their love for me.

While I was glad for the guilt (because it proved that I knew what was right from wrong), it was still very difficult to deal with during my treatment. I believe this was because it compounded with my insecurity and victim mentality. It's like the guiltier I felt, the more insecure I became of my actions and choices, and the worse my victim mentality got. Which then made me feel guiltier because I felt like a burden to everyone around me. Which then made me feel more insecure as I would continue to view myself as an evil monster, which then... you get the picture. It was a vicious cycle that kept getting worse until my therapist very directly told me that I was victimizing myself during one of our sessions. I wanted to argue. I really felt like it doesn't apply to me. I felt my anger rise up at the accusation. But, I knew I had distorted thinking from my NPD, and my therapist is just likely to be more objective than I am.

So, I did some searching on people with victim mentalities. I found that I fit the profile of negative self-talk, self-sabotage, overthinking, making excuses to avoid responsibility, resentment, etc. It was a lot. I felt overwhelmed. This was a whole new thing that I had to deal with on top of my NPD. I started to feel hopeless as I focused on how long it would take me to get my life back on track. I then felt angry at my parents. Angry that they contributed to my past trauma and that they likely caused me permanent psychological damage. This went on for days. Then, as I was self-reflecting, I realized how I was falling into the trap the symptoms described. I realized that I was actively victimizing myself, even in describing the root cause of my victimization. So, I began to tackle those symptoms by using brute force.

One by one, I would google the symptoms and read about scientifically-approved therapeutic approaches. For example, practicing mindfulness was a big one in dealing with overthinking. So, whenever I found myself overthinking about something, I would immediately shift my focus towards what I'm doing at the moment. Am I cleaning the house and I started to think of that one time I was caught in a lie? Then I better focus on reaching every nook and cranny. Am I at work inputting data and I just remembered a particularly humiliating rejection? Then I better focus on finding any trends or deviations in this dataset. I became good at this. My worry and general anxiety subsided significantly. I also became more focused on the work that I'm currently doing over fantasies that may or may never happen. Even my manager noticed this, and has started teaching me new skills and giving me better projects. It felt great to be valued at work.

I just kept making my way down through the list of symptoms while trying to be objective. The most difficult symptom to tackle was resentment. Mainly because getting over resentment requires forgiveness which, in turn, requires acceptance. I was bad at that. Very bad. But, I had practiced relinquishing control over my anxiety when I was trying to deal with my suicidal behavior. Logically speaking, if I can accept anxiety, then I should be able to accept other negative emotions. With this mindset, I first set to work by learning more about those emotions.

Guilt, for example, is a negative emotion with an important purpose. Guilt tells me when I've done something wrong, and when there's a lesson to learn from it. Thus, if I'm feeling guilty, it must be because there's a lesson that I need to learn. This realization allowed me to discard 'useless guilt', which is guilt over things that weren't my fault. For example, my guilt over my previous trauma. I was a child when it happened. What's the lesson to learn from this feeling of guilt here? That I shouldn't trust my own parents as a child? That's nonsense. I would never expect this of another child and I shouldn't expect it of myself. Thus, I shouldn't feel guilty about this.

I then started to calibrate my guilt. I used a technique where I would close my eyes, project an emotion in front of my imagination, and visualize it. I would determine the emotion's color, shape, and size. Guilt was always purple irregular blob for me. The worse my guilt would get, the bigger and more irregular this purple blob would be. I would then relive previous memories that are causing me guilt, and try to recalibrate and determine their importance. For example, is there any point to feeling massive amounts of guilt for that one time I stole a Snickers bar from a grocery store 10 years ago? No, I've already learned my lesson. Thus, the guilt from this memory is overinflated.

  
**Insecurity, Need for Attention**  
I then started practicing the acceptance technique with all my negative emotions. Whether it was anger, sadness, jealousy, shame, etc. The irrelevant regrets from previous years started to matter less. I also noticed that it became harder for me to feel overwhelmed by those emotions. As in, I no longer had the urge to punch walls whenever I got angry. Instead, I would let myself feel the anger, honestly reflect on why I feel that way, and then calibrate as necessary.

This newfound acceptance was also key in practicing self-advocacy and getting over my insecurities. For example, I was very cowardly. My dad was very concerned with self-image and he always shamed me for making mistakes. I was also always expected to shut up, take my punishment, and move on. Any attempt to argue would lead to more abuse. This made me terrified of standing up for myself over the years. Deep down, I always knew I was a coward. But, I also knew that I didn't want to be a coward. To solve this problem, I had to start by accepting the shame of being terrified all the time.

Once I identified my insecurities and the feelings associated with them, I had to find a way to work on them without messing up my current relationships. I remember thinking *""Man, I wish I had someone who understood me that could give me advice"".* I then realized that this was a role I had to fill for myself. So, I used a technique wherein I started to think of myself in the 3rd person. I would pretend that I'm just another friend who needs genuine advice. I would then try to objectively consider the situation, think about a rational solution, and then follow through with my own advice.

Essentially, I became my own personal hero. Basically guiding myself and nudging myself along whenever I reach a roadblock. I would push myself further every time to do necessary things that would usually scare me. At first, it was little things like voicing my opinion whenever I disagreed with someone. Then, it became saying no to my controlling roommate whenever he had an unreasonable demand. Then, it became standing up for myself whenever I'm insulted. This was especially challenging because I also had to be rational, fair, and polite while self-advocating. But, one incident at a time, I saw my confidence grow to new heights.

This confidence boost was important in dealing with my neediness. I started to notice I no longer cared for an external supply. That I was my own supply, in a way. I didn't need someone else's attention to feel good about myself. I had myself to do that. I was confident in my ability to guide myself, and in my vision of who I wanted to be. And, since I accepted myself and my feelings, I no longer cared as much about what other people thought of me. Getting attention from someone else seems like a step-down at this point.

TLDR: A ton of self-reflection and therapy helped me in overcoming my NPD.",405

I can't break things or other people because I need them and deep down I want them and probably want to break them in a way to break myself. Tonight I really wanted to just get fucked up and fuck off because the only ways I want to let out my anger are unproductive, unrealistic, illegal (like that's ever stopped me), or just straight up evil (don't even get me started on the bone that I have to pick about my cruel thoughts). i didn't end up doing drugs but instead I stayed up 5 hours longer than I should have and my head hurts more.

44,Getting treatmeant for Narcissism,SylveonBoy,13,nx9icy,2021-06-11 06:49:12,11,"Which kind of therapy, is there a way to talk about Narcissitic/NPD traits to a therapist without ending up getting diagnosed, any there any self-help sources? (When i try to look up help its all only for people around the narcissist and not for the narcissitic person)? 
My main problems are:

I dont really care if i hurt other people unless i have chosen that person as my equal/an extension of me then i really care

I do think its fun to make people upset/angry/sad but only if i dont like them/are neutral about them. I especially want them to hurt if they did something harmfull to me or one of the people i care about (mainly because thats an attack on me aswell)

I dont feel like i have a real personality, i only have an intense need for validation, praise, love and recognition

When someone annoys me i want to hurt them, i usually do this by changing my tone to make it clear that I dont like them, i usually want to do violent stuff aswell but i can hold myself back

I lie a lot, and its very hard for me to stop even when i try

As soon as a person (even one i did care about) is out if my life/is not really any use for me. I completely stop caring, cut the connection and find someone else

I get extremely depressed, like actively considering to kms, when i dont have people around me to think i am great, it only takes 3 days without people actively admirering me before i get to this state

I believe i dersevere better than other people and that i am better, this leads to a lot of disappointment and anger when people around me dont recognize it.

I try to manipulate sometimes, but I am bad with social cues and often fail and just anger people or upset them

When i dont want people to be upset or anger them or hurt them i often acidentally do

I get extremely jealous of others, especially if they are getting recognition for something i should be getting it for instead. I get very angry with the person who got the recognition instead of me.

I will choose an authority figure who i believe is superior in some way and really try and make them like me, I will plan stuff around making them notice me and think i am special. When i realize they are just a person who isnt special i completely loose interest

I feel like i am the most worthless horrible person in the world, i feel like i am just like my dad who violently (emotionally and physically) abused me because he had similar traits

I dont really feel any emotions exept rage and anger or intense emptyness or sometimes satisfaction when i get recogntion.

I feel no remorse when i do something to hurt other people that didnt hurt me, sometimes (often) i even find it kind of funny

When people get upset with me or are upset around me i usually dont feel bad and i dont know how to react to them or make them okay, my go to is just kind of laughing ackwardly, or i will go full empath mode, exept i dont care about them i just pretend i really do, when i do that i feel better about myself for being a good person and i will think about it for a long time and make it a really big deal i did that for them. I dont expect anything in return, except they should think i am a good person aswell.

I really dont function in social situations, i am very ackward and introverted and i find it very hard to communicate with people and just have fun with them(might be more autism related)

I dont want to talk to people unless there is some kind of endgoal with it, usually my goal will be recognition, higher social status, or in general me obtaining something.

When i am with a group of people i feel superior too and i havd higher status than i will exploit that to put them down and have fun with saying incredebly rude and devaluing things, though if i believe it will start to have a consequense for me i will stop.

I do have a compass of what is right and wrong, but i am also very aware that i can just disregard it if i want to with no consequences and it is very tempting for me at times, but i feel superior if i dont do morally wrong things (this is mostly through the lense of social justice) its not that i dont care about the people, and if i am advocating for a minority, especially one i am a part of I do mean it, but a lot of that probably cones from me builiding my personality on being morally superior

I cant take critisicm, it makes me feel completely worthless and very angry/upset.

If i am hurting someone i dont really want to hurt, but they are disagreeing with me and i want to make my point, it doesnt really bother me that they got very upset, i do feel remorse if it hurt me indirectly (like my other friends being mad at me) but me making my point matters more to me than them not being upset

I dont really believe any of the relationships i have had that failed have been my fault, but i am starting to question it after learning about personality disorders.

I also have sone traits of narcissim that just dont really bother me so i havent listed them here, but the ones i have listed i feel like are making me hurt others which i do know is bad even if i dont care that much, but it will also hurt me in the end. I would like to feel empathy, i did when i was younger (like 3-4) at least i think but i am not sure. I mainly remeber traumatic stuff from before i was 12. I think people who dont feel like this are a lot happier and live better lifes.

I am currently trying to get an autism diagnosis because of other stuff but also because of some of these traits, i am 17 rn so that might make it easier for me to just talk to a therapist about these things without getting a diagnosis for a personality disorder? Also autism (especially aspergers) treatmeant does focus on not hurting other people and fitting in, at least i think so? But i dont know if that will fix the underlying problem. Also im not trying to claim i have a personality disorder as i am 17 and just have not done wnpugh research on all the traits of one, but i really do struggle with these things and i want to get better and i dont know how.

45,WTH.,unknownpls2,0,r1fzpf,2021-11-24 21:42:36,8,"Hey everybody!

I just wanted to share my story.

&#x200B;

After breaking up with my **ex narcissist**, I decided to take a **""mini revenge""** and show them that I'm dating another person to make them feel pissed and easily replaceable. They sure got angry, but that's not the subject. I, also, wanted to know what did it feel to be my ex, so I started copying their behavior and doing it on the current person I picked. I started it off by love-bombing them for two months or so. Once I felt like I locked them in, I started ignoring them, I emotionally cheated on them, I'd start arguments on purpose, I'd imply the silent treatment, I'd gaslight them, make them feel bad...etc.

The thing is that I don't feel bad about it. The only reason that I am with them right now is that I am **severely afraid to be alone**.

I've been thinking about taking revenge on my ex obsessively, and I can't control it. 

**P.S.:** *I'm unsure if I'm a narcissist, but the thought that I might be is haunting me right now.*

46,Stop Beating Yourselves Up: A Communique,ImperiousAnarchist,75,r2oqc0,2021-11-26 14:31:40,27,"I've read enough of the navel-gazing in this subreddit to see a common pattern. NPDs here beat themselves up for past abusive behavior, lack of empathy, self-centeredness, and so on.

The truth is, a lot of non-mentally ill people in the world don't have affective empathy either. If they did, then we wouldn't see things like genocide or homelessness. What, you think all the Hutus that murdered all those Tutsis in Rwanda were NPD or ASPD? Beating yourself up for something that a lot of normies don't even have is not only counterproductive, it's also self-absorbed. Woe-is-me kind of shit. Typical of vulnerable narcissism.

What separates us from the normies is that normies hold themselves accountable (for the most part) and they stay true to certain values like kindness in their daily lives (for the most part). A lot of narcs around here don't seem to have any values at all beyond being famous, wealthy, or having a bunch of groupies. 

Even the narcs that seem regretful: no real values. The narcs that castigate themselves see themselves as unfixable. Let's be honest: if you work hard, you can be kind, considerate, and trustworthy in the long run. You might even have intimate and loving relationships. Enough of the pity parties, guys.

They aren't going to validate my family and I, so why would I exactly care to have any kind of, ""friendship,"" with them after having been very kind and caring about their pets?  Whom are the only ones I have fond memories of from that period of my life (and I know they are happy in heaven).

53,Let’s be real about the suffering that comes with NPD,reverent_blu,111,paupuh,2021-08-24 19:45:31,31,"I don’t think most people will be able to be real with me on here or understand and relate what I have to say because we are all at different stages of self awareness, but oh well I’m still going to post anyway. Also a lot of people on here also only have traits and are not diagnosed like me. And I understand that. But I’m talking about the internal suffering of what it’s like to be a true pathological narcissist. At least when you’ve had an ego death like I have, it finally uncovers all the suffering. 

I bet you thought one of the first things I would mention “suffering from” is “insecurity”, because there’s this whole gag about narcissists secretly being insecure. Let me tell you, I don’t feel insecure at all. I love myself intensely, to the point  I feel incredibly superior daily, (feeling like I have achieved enlightenment has only made this more intense if anything). But I’m absolutely tortured internally. 

No let’s talk about missing out on my entire childhood, completely. I had a really warped, disturbing fucking childhood and there’s so much numbed suffering there that even slightly re-discovering it in therapy as I am now, is incredibly horrific. 

Growing up without ever experiencing love or safety. Nothing was safe and now you’re constantly on high alert, you can never truly relax, 24/7, on such high alert that you lash out at things that have nothing to even do with you. You’re exhausted.

And lets not discount all the blacked out gaps in memory spanning years and years, the bittersweet never-ending feeling of emptiness, the realization that you don’t have a core, and even if you do, it’s warped beyond belief and the internal experience is so uncomfortable. Fragmented.

Let’s not forget the realization that you don’t know what the fuck will happen to you if you go in to therapy, because no narcissist has really come out the other side. They all quit, and then their “disorder” completely overtakes them by the time they’re in their 60s and they become a walking personification of narcissism itself with nothing else to them. And you wonder if that’s going to be you too but you know you can’t stay in this hell.

And what about the anxiety? For me PTSD and GAD, and after my ego death it turned into full-blown Depersonalization disorder. 
The nightmares every night, how you can fall asleep but yet you never really get a good nights rest. If you don’t have an actual nightmare, you wake up sweating from night terrors instead. 

Or you just wake up feeling empty and not quite right. Dreams of wandering forever through wastelands completely forgotten by the world, dreams of being trapped in-between the floorboards of abandoned houses rotting out in the woods, never be found. Reoccurring dreams of overflowing waste or just filth for some fucking reason, dreams of fragmented childhood memories that make the sleep experience incredibly uncomfortable and make no sense, and you just wish you could get some fucking rest. 

And what about the anger? Man that used to be what I felt was such a strength. My anger, I was so good at protecting myself, but what happens when you’re like me and accidentally get yourself into an ego death, and then you find out that half the time you’re angry, you’re actually misperceiving the world. You’re feeling insulted for no reason. You’re misperceiving. 

The realization that you’re going to have to work through bouts of rage the rest of your life that can easily destroy others with the blink of an eye, i mean if you actually want connection in life so be prepared for that. Knowing you have to constantly watch yourself and second guess, just to see what the hell’s really going on. 

What about how it feels to not ever know what you’re feeling at any given moment in time? That you don’t know how to name your own emotions because they’ve been so repressed you can’t understand what the fuck you’re feeling. A lot of times you don’t feel anything at all anyway. Not much. Just kind of... dull imitations of feelings.

What about the complete and utter lack of passion. There’s just nothing in the world that interests you outside of yourself. All the human causes this world has to offer, all the beauty and strife, it’s mostly just boredom that you’re left with. 

Unless of course you’re having a dramatic day and everything is revolving around you. Everything‘s super exciting and people are all over you. Why is that the only time life feels worth it? Oh yeah and on that note we can add in the depression that results from pretty much all of this. 

Now this, this is NPD. At least this is what it is for me. This is the dark side of it. 

People online, all these “narcissistic abuse gurus” who think they know jack shit, it just makes me laugh. They’re so blind. They’re more surface-level and shallow than I was before I was diagnosed, and that’s saying a lot.

But I’m not going to go without listing how good I feel sometimes. How strong being a narcissist makes me. The strongest. I have literally defeated unspeakable things that would have caused most people to break down or lose their shit. I have overcome the worst circumstances a child could’ve been given, I have completely re-created myself into everything I loved and admired, and I am successful at work, I am adored by pretty much everyone I meet. I’m charming. I’m extremely good looking (off my own hard work to be that) and I usually get what I want. 

I’m capable of taking on things that many people are not. I am ambitious and smart as hell, and my emotions don’t get in the way of my decisions which makes me very clearheaded and able to accomplish a lot more than many.

But let’s just for a moment give light to what being a narcissist is really like. 

Because in terms of the amount of hate and the horrific things I have seen online, the complete invalidation that people like me experience when facing the world, 

(there are articles out there claiming that narcissists don’t even suffer or have real emotions, articles detailing how ppl can MAKE them suffer too on top of it all, just to give you an example) 

and with all the misinformation spread far and wide, I would go as far as to say this is the most misunderstood thing on the planet.

56,How I dealt with anger issues,verminpeople,27,g3n2ie,2020-04-18 12:56:00,4,"I posted this as a comment in another sub and thought some people here could find it useful:

I used to have very little self-awareness. When I wasn't attuned to my inner states, anger felt like flipping a switch. I was calm one second and the next I was flipping out. The truth is that I wasn't ""calm"" but completely disconnected from my emotions until they got too intense to ignore. At that point, any attempt at self-restraint or appeal to logic was useless.

When I started seeking therapy, at first I was suggested to do CBT but for someone alexithymic such as me, it was too frustrating. In my case, keeping a journal worked far better.

This is how I'd usually write about my day: I'd start merely describing the situation that had elicited a strong emotion or conflict, and what had led to it. Then I'd start writing a list of plausible explanations, whether I agreed those were the cause or not. I paid special attention to those that either clicked with me as in 'oh, that makes sense!' and those who elicited strong negative reactions such as 'no fucking way!'. Kind of like trying to reverse-engineer my feelings.

Keeping a journal helped me in these ways:

* It made me more vigilant of my emotions, since I knew I had to write about them later. It started as a conscious effort, but it became easier eventually.
* It led me to realize that most of my outburst were preceded by jealousy, shame, indignation, or disappointment.
* It helped me pinpoint the early signs of an anger outburst. This is useful to find ways to resolve the anger before it becomes unmanageable. For example, I noticed that many of my outbursts started by relentlessly questioning the other person. I didn't know why I did it, but I knew I did it, so when it happened, I knew it was time to take a time-out and reflect (now I know it was a passive-aggressive tactic to punish a person who had elicited any of the aforementioned emotions in me. I'd ask to find faults in their logic and make them feel foolish or guilty. Whether they fell for it -to me, showing weakness- or confronted me -making me even more furious-, rage ensued).
* It made me conscious that even if in the moment it feels like you will never get over it unless you act out, it's not actually true (as long as you don't dwell on it on purpose when you feel yourself starting to let go, which is something I used to do to make sure that no one who wronged me left unpunished and to not admit I had overreacted).
* It changed my relationship with my negative or vulnerable emotions, from ""avoid/suppress at all costs"" to ""this is important information"".

I think it's important to state that the journal remained 100% private, even to my therapists. If not, I think I would have been hesitant to write about situations or drawing conclusions that painted me in a bad light. Ideally one should feel comfortable enough with their therapist to share everything, but reality is a different matter.

So that's it, basically. Learning to unpack the experience of anger as in, identify the emotions that led to it and learn to resolve them in non-aggressive ways (my to-go strategy nowadays is avoiding situations that cause them, which is not very healthy but it's better than being an abuser), detect the early signs and take time-outs to reflect before logic flies off the window, and realizing that I was causing long-lasting harm from temporary feelings.

Sometimes I require really long time-outs (at least 2-3 days) to calm down again. I often don't allow myself to talk to the other person during this time. Sometimes I tell myself that if I'm still mad after 3 days, I'll allow myself to lash out or punish the other party in some way so I can resist the temptation to do it in the moment, and fantasize about how I'd do it, but I don't. As with suicidal intent, the trick is to delay action until the emotion has receded. Other things I do during this cool down periods are:

* Write about it as I used to do in my journal. It usually helps me put my ideas in order before I talk to the other party about what happened (because the idea is not to put away the problem forever, but to deal with it when you're in the mood of doing it in a productive way).
* See people I'm not angry with. Socializing puts me in 'performing mode' and changes my mood easily.
* Listen to music that matches my mood, watch/read fragments from people/characters I identify with. Stuff like that. It calms me down a bit. I think it makes me feel understood or something.
* Distract myself with activities to let time pass ruminating as little as possible. Things that don't require mental effort (because I'm usually in no condition) such as going for a walk, watching TV, playing video games, etc.

Something I still struggle with to this day, is when people keep bugging me after I've made clear that I want to end the conversation. I rarely have any anger outbursts nowadays but when I do is usually because of this. So I kind of need people to cooperate with my problem. I think it's a good idea to tell your loved ones, while you're not angry (because when you are, you may find it tempting to word it in a way that is hurtful and punitive), that this happens to you and that you need them to respect your cool down period.

This is what has worked in my particular case of being someone with terrible emotional awareness (SPD+NPD) and extreme sensitivity to shame (NPD+AvPD).",27
57,The woman (his tenant/disciple) who my NPD ex kicked out of his house when I moved in tried to warn me about him but my anger and lack of empathy made me ignore her pain. Karma.,allisonewithall,1,gycmss,2020-06-07 13:43:40,8,"When I met my now ex boyfriend, he had a boyfriend-girlfriend couple living in his home. As a person with communal NPD (I think), they were one of the many people he benevolently counseled about their life problems. When I rebuffed his attempts to counsel me, rather than just be my empathetic boyfriend, he'd tell me I was missing out on his advice because he'd helped so many people with their problems and was ""really good at it."" 

In reflecting, I realize there were plenty of times when I'd acted the same -- thinking I had all the answers for other people's problems. I can still be this way, arrogant.

In any case, when I moved in with him, I looked forward to having another woman in the house. I figured we could become friends. But, a few days after I moved in, I asked her boyfriend if I could use one of his microphones and the girlfriend blew a total fit. She told me to stay away from her man and if I needed to talk to him, do it through her. This all culminated in my now ex telling the couple they had to move out. They were both angry at first but the boyfriend came around, realizing that for two years they'd paid incredibly low rent. But the woman stayed furious. At one point, my ex yelled at her in, what I thought then, was an uncharacteristic way.

As she prepared to leave, she glared at me and said of my ex, ""You watch. The same thing is going to happen to you. He's not who you think he is."" 

I thought she was just bitter and mentally unstable (I told a social worker how she behaved and he said it sounded like BPD). 

But 18 months later, her words ""He's not who you think he is"" came back to me. She was exactly right. She saw what I had been blind to when I was the idealized newbie and she was being discarded as one of his pet projects.

I realize how I had no empathy for her plight. I was just happy she was leaving because she was consistently mean to me after the blowup, sometimes overtly so, other times passive aggressively. But now I see that, even though she was that way, I could have cared about how it must have felt to be in her situation -- to have someone you thought was your friend throw you out with malice. On the one hand, her behavior was off the charts, on the other hand, I still could have cared about her. But I didn't really show her that I did. For instance, I could have said ""I'm sorry things turned out this way"" and really meant it. But, even though I prayed for her, in my heart, I felt she got what she deserved. 

Eighteen months later, the table turned.
I broke up with my ex because he didn't defend me when my daughter (24), who was living with us, hit me. She still lives in his house. He's temporarily living with the ex before me.

I couldn't understand how my daughter could be so callous towards me and pro my ex after he gaslighted me, traumatizing me. 

But now I see. She could care less about how he hurt me just like I didn't care about that other woman's feelings. After my ex discarded me, my daughter ignored me when I tried to warn her that he isn't who she thinks he is. In the same way, I ignored the warning I received about him by the woman he discarded before me. All I cared about was what benefited me -- having her gone. I'm sure that's exactly how my daughter felt when I left.

59,Unloading frustration on random people. [aka coping by being an asshole],Nervous_Passenger698,7,rcux3e,2021-12-09 23:59:38,7,"I don't know if anyone is struggling with a similar habit. Whenever I face difficulties that frustrate me, I find that I have a tendency to be an asshole to those around me. Does it mean that losing control of some area of ​​life increases the need to control or humiliate other people? I would like to understand this mechanism.

I had an example of this today - one person in the morning irritated me because she refused to admit I was right and insisted on her opinion. Then I had a huge problem with asthma all day (the attacks actually started the night before). I couldn't smoke all day, I couldn't drink alcohol in the evening. Basically, it made me pissed off with the whole world all day and was a mean bitch to every, even the most random person. Although I try not to be like that on a daily basis. It turns out that I have a hard time trying, pretending and being a pro-social person when, for example, I have a health problem, feel unwell or something is not going my way. If you have something similar - how do you deal with it?

EDiT: I could add that being an asshole I am definitely more ""authentic"" and more myself / whatever that means /. But I like myself less in this role.

* I was an abusive piece of shit as a teenager. I could not control my anger like at all. The ways that I talked to and treated my family were wayyyyyyy past the excusability line. 
* Yes I have matured a lot and have better self control, yes I feel ashamed, yes I feel bad for my parents sometimes, but no on the whole I don't feel bad, because I'm still angry. I still feel justified in some way. I'm terrified I don't have the self control or awareness to prevent repeating the behavior of my childhood. For when I was younger, I can make excuses and say ""Oh I was just a dumb teenager"" but as an adult there would be much more serious consequences. 

Grandiosity/vulnerability:

* Ok yeah, I secretly think I'm the shit. Over and over again I can impress people. I've always been smart, pretty and talented. 
* Yeah I hog conversations, talk about myself too much, don't care enough about what's happening in other people's lives. Put people down, get into unnecessary disagreements, get easily offended. It's not that I don't care at all it's that there's always something more interesting to focus on. I want to share my opinion more than I want to hear other people's. 
* I'm insecure af. I've also been bullied, excluded and abused over and over. Just as many people have thought I was weird as have been impressed by me. The result is I really want admiration and crave positive attention to make up for those times where I was hurt unfairly. More to prove to myself that I'm good then to anybody else. 

Ok, that was hard, but I feel a bit better. Maybe it will be easier next time. Maybe I'll actually be able to talk to my therapist about it. Self sabotage is fun /s",16

Do you ever split a person back in white, when you have that person ""locked inside the black box"" ?

Please, be honest and think before answering. Just because you still hangs out with that person that you´ve split in black, doesn´t mean you have forgiven the person. You could still be ""friend"" with a person but at the same time have anger/hateful feelings towards him/her.

64,Lost a friend,Unusual_Staff_4822,16,oqr1oz,2021-07-24 14:25:45,6,"I'm new here and desperate for advice.

I cannot stand getting ignored. I completely lose.

I made a new friend six months ago. We got really close and talked for hours everyday. For a while we were more than friends until he stopped having feelings for me about a month ago and all hell broke lose.

Fastforward to today. I wrote to him last night asking to start over and just be friends. He said yes. I wrote ""yes, I would like to go back to how it was before"". No reply. So today I wrote to him again and we started talking and it turned out he wanted to go aaaall the way back to the beginning of our friendship where we barely talked and he said he didn't want to be close friends with me again. 

I lost it again and I should have just let it be but I just couldn't. He has blocked me everywhere and he doesn't want anything to do with me ever again. 

Has this happened to anyone else and how did you deal with it? 


I tried to remind him that I am not well and he got angry and said ""but you don't do this to people even if you're not well"" but I feel like that is what's wrong with me. I treat people like shit and then get sad and want to kill myself when they don't want to talk to me anymore.",16

i understand many people there are teenagers, but isn't it common sense???

it makes me angry that there is so much people here who aren't as tough as me.

68,"Some DAE questions, i guess",KevinTheKoop,3,gdn0sy,2020-05-04 23:50:59,4,"I have BPD with several other mental illnesses and narcissistic traits on top of it all. I mainly struggle with entitlement, extreme sensitivity to and aversion to criticism, feelings of superiority and lack of empathy. But my empathy is weird. I have it, but at the same time in some situations I don’t at all. I try to avoid situations that’ll upset me and make me go into what I’d assume would be “narcissistic rage.” I haven’t been diagnosed, but I do have pretty bad narcissistic traits. So, I was wondering, can anyone relate to any of this:

I lack empathy in some situations. For example, I’m unable to feel happy for others. If someone is engaged, pregnant, in a happy relationship etc I’ll get angry and bitter. I try not to be fake and be all like “oH iM so hAPpY foR yOU!!!” because that’s not the case, but I do respond in a socially acceptable manner that isn’t overly disingenuous. Other examples include certain issues in general everyone seems to get all up in arms about but I shrug off and am confused about why exactly people are so upset about it. However, in other situations, I experience empathy to a very high, inappropriate degree that’s capable of ruining my day or week or whatever because I’ll feel it so strongly. Such examples include loss of a loved one and animal abuse among a few others.

I’m very entitled. This is a tricky one though. I repeatedly thank my parents over the tiniest things (I’ll thank them more than once just for making dinner or I’ll even thank them in passing just in general) and I’ll feel very guilty for receiving presents, especially when I don’t have anything for them in return. On the other hand, in some situations I’m very entitled. I become enraged when others are getting more attention than me. I expect everything to be about me. An example: In high school, there was this awards ceremony type thing. Some people got a few, others only got one. I got one. It was a pretty significant one, but I sat there silently seething over the fact that some people got more than one and was thinking about how I’m entitled to pretty much all the awards, despite some not even applying to me. I knew this was irrational but I was in a bad mood for the rest of the day because of it. On an even more pathetic note, I’ll feel it with social media. Some people manage to get hundreds of likes despite being just an average person I went to school with. I’ll get super pissed about that and will expect hundreds of likes from people too and will tell myself, “Clearly they bought their likes. At least I’m not that pathetic.”
I freak out when I see that someone unfollowed me. Even on Reddit, if I see that a post gets a lot of upvotes or awards, I’ll be angry.

The tiniest disagreement will lead to feelings of rage. Sometimes I struggle to hold back. A few weeks ago, for example, I posted something on social media. Someone said they agree with me but that I shouldn’t say it a certain way. I said something snotty then immediately deleted it before they saw it (but it showed in the chat that a message has been deleted), and I unfriended them. Someone can agree with me but not like the wording and I’ll go into a rage. It’s tiny things like that that set me off. And an actual disagreement? Oh my goodness. I’ll be unable to see straight and will shake from the irrational amount of anger. Actual criticism is the very worst. In the past, I have been guilty of giving the silent treatment to those who have disagreed with me or criticized me. I’ve even ended friendships because of that. It’s not something I’m proud of, but I’d say this is the right place to mention it to see if anyone else relates. I’m also not above blocking people who disagree with me. Yep, I’m one of them. Again, not proud of it, but I feel like this is the place to say it. I always have to have the last word in every argument, or else I’ll never let it go and will have attacks of intense anger when looking back on them, and having what I feel is a “gotcha!” moment by having the last word and refusing to read their response or blocking them altogether is a huge relief to me and that’s the only thing that pacifies the rage. I will admit, it’s the exact equivalent of a child covering their ears and yelling “I’m not listening!!!!”

I feel like a shitty person for all of this, but I was wondering if anyone here could relate at all. In general I’m a good person, and I have plenty of traits that would suggest that maybe I’m not a narcissist, but this is some of the stuff I struggle with. There’s more, but I think this post is long enough. Thanks for reading this far!

Edit: my old therapist would also talk about “rejection sensitive dysphoria” and also brought up the term “fragile narcissism” a few times and they seem to fit me to a T.",3
69,Birthday meltdown,taway7440,6,nk8688,2021-05-24 20:56:32,43,"Hi all,

Just need someone to talk to. Every bday I have a narcissistic meltdown because I feel like I didn't get what I deserve or what I imagined. And I fight myself so hard on this but year after year same shit happens and I feel so down in the dumps.

What triggered me this time - I opened my gift from my boyfriend and I saw it was a 30 min massage certificate.

My first thoughts: ""30 min? is this a joke? everyone knows 60 min is a minimum massage duration. I have to go all the way there to the massage place for a 30 min session? what a waste. he is so fucking cheap. My presents for him are so much better and more expensive....""

This triggered a meltdown and made me cry. Logically, he organized a bday lunch for me and spent 2 days hiking with me and then half a day helping to prepare for my bday lunch with friends. He also got me cake and flowers.

But right now I hate him for being such a cheap ass for my present.

It also majorly triggered me today that at my bday mini golf I was the last of 8 people to pitch and no one was watching me, everyone moved on ahead and I was alone. Then when it was time for cake the park was closing and we had 2 min for people to sing happy bday and cut cake. I got so little attention and in the photos of me blowing out candles I look pissed. 

I dont want to be this way. Please go easy on me.

I can try to hide how I feel but inside I feel awful.",6

I can’t understand emotions properly nor my own, I’m autistic and been told I can lack empathy. Sometimes I’m controlling because I’m scared for the person and want them near me so I can give them love

When other people are sad they also make me feel bad because I want to cure and be their relief but I can’t. But sometimes I just blatantly think they’re being soft and need to suck it up 

I don’t feel any pain when others on the news are reported injured, I feel cold. At the same time I love dogs and I have tremendous feelings of sadness, connection and love with people close to me, and I would help a stranger, I sometimes give them money and get upset that bystanders just walk away

When I argue with people I always need to gaslight or make them feel like they’re insane :. 

I also scream and spend time writing hurtful things on Twitter to people I disagree with, I get thoughts of harm.

71,Anyone else able to just “switch off” their empathy for certain people they dislike?,anonymous19272,37,pq1xcg,2021-09-17 15:06:10,11,"Just want to know if anyone else gets this and why I feel this way. To clarify I can and do feel empathy for the people I’m close to (family members, partner, close friends).

But I have an extreme pet-peeve for needy, clingy, sensitive people. When I meet people and get this vibe from someone I automatically lose all respect for them and think they need to grow a backbone, which is completely ironic because for most of my life I’ve been this person, up until a few years ago when I realised it made me annoying and I never had any luck with men because of it.

Anyways now I just turn off my empathy for people I perceive as weak, then after that when they react to something I’ve done to hurt them, I think they’re just using fake emotion to manipulate and guilt trip me instead of them being actually upset, which in turn makes me angry and I hurt them further.

72,Impulsiveness and emotionality. Does anyone also have a problem distinguishing between these concepts?,Nervous_Passenger698,3,qy6dkb,2021-11-20 14:11:39,11," For a long time I have described myself as ""very emotional"". I considered myself to be so. By this I meant that I often react quickly, spontaneously and ""follow my heart"" or my intuition/gut feeling without considering the pros and cons.  In one word, I do what I want on the spur of the moment. Now I think it's more impulsiveness than emotionality, although I still don't get the exact difference. Or is it that emotionality is not about action, and impulsivity is primarily about reacting by doing? I don't know, maybe someone can understand it better and explain it to me. Because I'm more and more sure that I was wrong, that is, I was mistaking these concepts ...And if I told myself I should be ""less emotional"", it was rather that I wanted to be less impulsive. But are these concepts not related to each other?

>Emotionality is the observable behavioral and physiological component of emotion, and is a measure of a person's emotional reactivity to a stimulus. Most of these responses can be observed by other people, while some emotional responses can only be observed by the person experiencing them.  
>  
>Impulsivity is a multifactorial construct that involves a tendency to act on a whim, displaying behavior characterized by little or no forethought, reflection, or consideration of consequences. Impulsive actions typically are ""poorly conceived, prematurely expressed, unduly risky, or inappropriate to the situation that often result in undesirable consequences,"" which imperil long term goals and strategies for success. A functional variety of impulsivity has also been suggested, which involves action without much forethought in appropriate situations that can and does result in desirable consequences. ""When such actions have positive outcomes, they tend not to be seen as signs of impulsivity, but as indicators of boldness, quickness, spontaneity,

73,I hate my mother,leftover-pizza-,12,prdqxv,2021-09-19 18:41:16,8,"Hey,   


I’m 17 F and undiagnosed. This is just me venting but there’s a question I have for you as well. If you don’t feel like reading this far too long rant, I suggest you scroll down to the end lmao.  
   
The relationship between me and my mom is really unstable and I've overthought it so many times that I've become entirely clueless about what's happening.  
   
First some context. My mom is a very worried person, and a huge control freak.  
 To make sure everything lives up to her idea of ‘the right thing to do’, she wants to manage everything, including other people’s lives. On surface level, she just seems like a very caring and invested person, and she is. She wants nothing else for me than to be okay, but she’s never given me the room to experiment with life myself and I feel completely incompetent as a result. I never learnt to make decisions or think about what I want. I never learnt to deal with setbacks. I’ve never had to feel the consequences of my actions, because she’s always been there to save my ass. She has never taught me to do any chores around the house whatsoever, and now she complains that I don’t feel a responsibility to do chores; often accusing me of being lazy and taking everything for granted. Every interaction I have with her these days seems to end up as either a power struggle or an annoyingly long lecture where she says the same things she always says, yet nothing ever changes. Either of us corrects the other, who gets offended and passive aggressive. The situation escalates, she starts yelling at me, I ignore her, later she comes up to apologize. I've won, but at what cost? Every week again. It is honestly suffocating.  
   
See, I AM fucking lazy. I am an entitled and selfish asshole, I guess. I don’t clean my room when she’s been telling me to do it for weeks. I don’t study for tests whatsoever. I am late for school all the time, I have ghosted more people than I can count on my fingers and I forget appointments and birthdays. Part of this might be because of my ADHD but it’s also because I just couldn’t care less and feel like the rules don't apply to me. Now, I know I do all this, but God forbid that SHE calls me out on it. And the thing that’s weird to me is that I never get that angry when other people tell me to get my shit together, just her. My dad doesn’t really care about what I get up to, or at least isn't constantly in my face about what and how I should do better (which ironically leads to me being more responsible). With other people, I either convince myself that they're unimportant and I don't have to care about what they think, or I don’t get angry at them, but ashamed because I feel inferior to them.  
   
She makes me angry like nothing else can. I can feel it in my entire body, I get tense, irrational and feel like I could explode. Like I could lose control any moment and start yelling at her, cursing her out with the ugliest words I can think of and smashing stuff around the house. But I never explode. Instead I put on the most emotionally flat face I can manage, ignoring whatever she says until she leaves me alone, which of course makes her even more annoyed. She has asked me if she's doing something wrong and told me that she feels nothing she does is ever good enough for me and... I won't let it affect me, but deep down there's this sting of guilt. It bothers her that I can't be open with her. I’d even say it hurts her. But I feel physically unable to get the words out. I feel physically unable to get vulnerable and apologize to her, or ask her for support. And it has not always been like this. In fact, there was a time where I was extremely clingy with my mom. My parents separated when I was 7 and I saw her 5 days a week but would still cry every night I didn’t see her. But today, her entire… being… triggers the shit out of me and I’m just not entirely sure why.   
   
So alright, I guess that was just me venting. But there’s another reason I made this post. I am curious about how you guys experience anger. Do you experience it around certain people or situations? Do you get angry a lot, or maybe not at all? What happens when you do get angry? Please feel free to share anything you think is relevant or want to get off your chest in general.  
 

Thanks in advance,

Recently I have one friend who used to jump on on the bandwagon for years start to give very ‘to each their own’ neutral responses and it’s pissing me off bc I love bonding over shared displeasure/disapproval lol. I can’t even say anything about her recent change without showing how fucked up i am bc ‘why won’t you talk shit about people with me anymore’ sounds awful. I am sure this is why it’s so hard for me to make and keep friends. They probably assume I do the same to them back…. Sigh why am I like this 😩,18
76,How much longer can you stand violent thoughts ??,Dimethylchloride,30,mq0pdt,2021-04-13 11:55:40,66,"I don’t know wtf to do. I’m surrounded by people who make me want to at the very least put them in chokeholds. I have common instinctual visions of me sinking my teeth into people’s necks. I constantly fantasize about burning buildings down when I’m angry. Even the thought of killing someone’s pet as revenge seems appealing.

I’m not even a strong person. There’s nothing iamverybadass about this. But my mind veers towards violence so easily it’s going to drive me fucking insane, to the point of tears when I can’t do anything about it because social repercussions. I feel like I’m trapped in a hot air balloon and can’t escape from the pressure. It takes me so much not to hurt people who tilt my mood off. And for what? The stupidest thing sometimes. I don’t even have good reasons to be so angry most of the time, I’m just mentally fucked.

I try listening to music. I try meditating. I try distracting myself with friends. But the moment I’m exposed to the stimulus once again, I swear, I’m so tempted to hurt these people. I don’t know what to do.

77,Vehicle for Hatred,itshasssannn,10,rsdrpm,2021-12-30 22:14:09,6,"Sometimes I feel like I am a vehicle of hell and hate. It's gotten to the point where that's all I really feel. 

Fear, anger, jealousy, and lust but that's not really an emotion in my book, just a need to release something and let my thoughts melt away and get horny tunnel vision for a few minutes until its replaced with cold sickness. I have a need for violence. Orgasmic fast violence, to myself and others. My head impacting with some hard red object at the speed of an ejaculation, my teeth embedding themselves in it and ripping out of my mouth leaving a hilarious gummy open mouth smile, my eyeballs embedding themselves too but they stay attached to the socket so when my head rushes back from the sheer force of it they stretch back. Its happens so fast that everything overlaps each other like frames in a cartoon, it happens in the blink of an eye. I can see it clearly. There's an orange sky behind me. And I'm smiling. When I think of that I feel a little loose in my legs, brings a little shiver to my spine, it's the kick I need, it brightens my day. Maybe if I was more violent I'd be more close to myself. If I lost everything, every bit of self control, and slammed someones head into a wall I would wake up from my coma. Just one violent act would make everything make sense. I'd break down crying. 

Does anyone else indulge themselves in success fantasies that titillate them but then when you think too long about them, they start to become terrifying? Does anyone else feel like they'd be happier if they just accepted being a loser and stopped chasing things, but also stopped relying on other people for anything? Disappear from the people you know and love and the people who's eyes you imagine when they are not near you, go somewhere where no one knows you or there is no one there to know you, stop talking to others and overtime stop talking to yourself and then just, blip. In the nothing, the big white light in your head will sink down to the size of a slowly spinning, small pulsing dying star, and then it will sink down more and more and more until it disappears. 

And then you'll walk out of the forest and you won't remember a thing about yourself, you won't remember a thing about your past or your present or your future, you won't understand those concepts to begin with, you won't know words or bodies or actions, you won't know and you won't care. You will walk out, and your mind will start over. Unmolded. And on the way back to nothing, you'll be molded only by the woods you walk through. And it will heal you and it will build you stronger walls. 

 Cover yourself in dirt and shit and grime. Being nothing feels like the only way to be happy.

78,How do you get diagnosed with NPD? What is the process and how long did it take?,rraa94,13,r2acz9,2021-11-26 00:21:04,3,"So, I am new to all of this. I am wondering about the process of being diagnosed with NPD. For example, if and when an individual confronts the need to have a psychological evaluation, is it common to receive a diagnosis from the first evaluation? Will lying - which is a common trait - obscure and prevent a diagnosis? Basically, what were your experiences of getting a diagnosis?",13
79,"Questions about Possibly having NPD, going to reach out to a specialist (have confirmed ocd and need guidance)",FrOCD1998,7,p2tq0j,2021-08-12 05:48:40,35,"Alright y’all, it seems a lot of who I thought I was is a lie. I’ve always been super selfless, but throwing myself over for people seems to be a way to get praise. At one point in life it was so bad that I’d masturbate to me achieving (scoring a touchdown and everyone cheering), things like that. I’m the center of attention always, and love that. 

Now, I’ve been with and recently moved in with my partner. We’ve been together for almost 2 and half years and alot has gone wrong. When we first started dating, I was head over heels like “yay I can finally be happy” (DPD, expecting others to make me happy I presume). It was going well until some of her issues peaked through, some of her issues that were related to a toxic ex as well as may be related to BPD. But anyways, I felt very isolated (nothing was awful like she didn’t hit me or call me names or things like that), so I reached out to an old fling who would be nicer and more communicative to me. I met up with said fling and didn’t do anything out of respect for my girlfriend and I returned back to her (we’re about a month in at this point). Eventually I came clean (like the next day cause I can literally never lie/keep a secret - idk why) 

Needless to say she was pissed and since then we’ve been together and for the first year I constantly compared her to said ex, which I believed was rocd (relationship themed ocd) since it was constant for about a year and I have ocd diagnosed and take meds for it. Through it all though, and after I quit worrying about that I was just always on her case. 

The thing is it feels/felt so okay to do. 

-she would be logically upset towards some of my harsher dark humor 

-she wouldn’t get rowdy at parties with me  (felt this made me look uncool by having the girlfriend who’s logically not an alcoholic)

-she wouldn’t do oral/kink sex all the time like I wanted

-she would be “right”, aka she wasn’t fitting the image in my head. 

-I’d constantly say to be more like person xyz (whether someone in a movie, a person I just met, or said old fling)

Eventually she broke and said she didn’t even feel like a person and I had continually beat her down to chase some image and I’d never find someone to fit it because I can’t compromise on anything. She says that I never ask how she is, what she likes, what I need to work on etc. every thing I do, whether buying a gift or a long talk is in efforts to get her to change her behavior to fit my needs. It’s all very selfish and this is where I fell upon NPD and I seem to fit the description. Insight much needed, would love to hear what sounds like NPD and why and what to do and if it gets better etc. thank you in advance.",7
80,Feels weird coming to this sub asking this question; But what the hell is wrong with /r/raisedbynarcassists?,nhelpthrowaway1,8,roghtl,2021-12-25 20:10:07,17,"So, I had a sort of revelation the last couple days about that sub, and I am now banned for victim blaming Kevin, of Home Alone.

Yes, the fictional character Kevin, from the fictional and slapstick silly universe Home Alone is set in.

[Here's the thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/rndpc1/kevin_mccallisters_family_were_narcs/hpv5wr0/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

EDIT: Forgot that the link above, the first comment is deleted, here's a copy/paste of it:

>I saw the same thing you did.  
>  
>Although, on the flipside, Kevin was also a HUGE fucking asshole of a kid too. I think this is an ""Everyone sucks here"" situation if Home Alone was real, and someone bitched about it on AITA.

And the one they deleted when I replied to them, that got me ""banned for gaslighting"" officially:

>You apparently didn't read my responses to the other guys in this very comment before slamming that button. I obviously retracted my statement after they rightfully corrected me.  
>  
>Just like last time, ironically.  
>  
>I get it, and I don't victim blame, and I don't ""have a problem"" with it. I'll try to avoid pissing you off more though.  
>  
>Merry Christmas, ya filthy animal.

I honestly don't think I was wrong here (although I'm totally aware I was basically ""asking for the ban"" in my reply, dude was being an idiot), and I was so beside myself in confusion for the 4th or 5th time on that sub as to how they expect to have any meaningful, worthwhile discussion.

So, in my confusion trying to figure out if I was or ever have been actually wrong over there, I googled the sub and the top mod (who has now banned me). A LOT of the results brought me to this very sub, ironically what should be the bastion of evil to those guys. But I started reading your posts and comments about the sub in various places throughout the months and years, and it all rings true with me.

So, I dare say, after some real sit-down thinking - I think their top mod is a full blown ""worst kinda type"" covert narcissist (EDIT for mods: Sorry, not looking to diagnose, this is just for discussions sake. Apologizes if this is out of line!), and many people in the community seem more willing to bitch about things than do anything about anything. Every post is ""GO NC!"" or ""You are 100% right no matter what period even if your story kinda makes you sound shitty too, it doesn't matter, you are a victim and thus perfect.""

I noticed these patterns over time, but mostly ignored them. Like you guys (whom are almost all also products of abuse yourselves, and very self aware of that fact) I assumed some of the hard nosed reactions were defense and coping mechanisms. But I'm starting to wonder if it's far worse, far deeper. To me, it kinda sounds like a lot of them have NPD and refuse to do any introspection of any kind.

I'm starting to think that sub is actually mostly people whom belong in *this* sub, and are not self-reflective enough to realize that they themselves could in fact, be the problem in some cases.

Could that sub be mostly angsty teens just mad they're being parented? I hate to think that way, and there's plenty of legitimate posts about abuses. But man is it hard to not shake that feeling of ""maybe you guys are all just immature assholes yourselves."" and ""maybe you should also consider the person with NPD may also need/want help too.""

Anyways, I'm not really sure how to go about discussing this, so I apologize if this post sounds like a rambling rant. I can't quite articulate what's going on I guess, and obviously I'm a little peeved I've been ironically ""victimized"" by a top mod. But maybe I have not?

Anyway, I'd love to discuss it with you guys. :)

EDIT/Random Thought: I also had a stray thought that somewhat scares me, but I'm having trouble not seeing it this way, as it seems factual; I think /npd might be the /raisedbynarc people who actually grew up and realized they're not perfect either, and want to be a better person themselves, rather than just blame their parents for everything. Sure, their parents may have been horrible, abusive crazy people themselves. But I feel like many of them refuse to acknowledge their own shortcomings and issues irrelevant to who/why/what caused it. You guys are self-aware, they are not?",8
81,Scared I have NPD.,takemylifeback4,8,rljvsq,2021-12-21 17:42:07,23,"Hi everyone, more so asking to see if people relate to some of these things. I have been diagnosed for OCD but haven’t done proper treatment and am starting next month hopefully. 

This Thanksgiving, it hit me that I’ve done a lot of not great things in my life and have justified them. So the past almost month, I’ve been obsessively and desperately trying to figure out and diagnose what I may have other than the OCD. I actually went to a therapist after convincing myself I have NPD, then convinced myself I have BPD. She said no, those things don’t sound like it but in a 50 minute session how much could she actually find? 

1. I sometimes lie to get out of things I’ve messed up. This could be “have you paid the car bill yet” and I say yes! Even though I haven’t. I’m convincing too and I feel bad about it.

2. I have taken things that aren’t mine from roommates. They are small things, like tampons or shampoo in the shower and I always tell myself “I’ll replace it!” And I have replaced some things, but other things I haven’t. Worse, if it’s from a roommate who has done annoying things like not helping with chores, I don’t feel as bad. I’ve also taken money from my family with the intention of paying it back, but I’m slow to.

3. I’ve exaggerated illness for attention. Once, I threw up because I was jealous and wanted my almost-partner’s attention on me because he was talking to a different girl who I thought he liked. Another time, I wasn’t feeling good and thought I may have a kidney infection. When my then-partner offered to take me to the dr. I felt emotionally better. Still went to the dr though and had something else wrong.

4. Fantasies/ daydreams. I daydream I’m either helping someone and look really good/knowledgeable after, or that they’re helping me in a situation I’m vulnerable in.

5. Love bombing? I want to do everything for my partner. Buying them small gifts that remind me of them, helping them with chores, taking care of them if sick. I just wonder if I do this to be self serving and make them feel like I’m so giving. I do love really hard. 

6. Not thinking things through fully. At times, I think that what I’m doing is fine and will work out because I’m solution oriented. However, some times it affects other people. This has not been out of malice or to hurt people.

7. Being awful at doing tasks at work I’m not interested in. With the OCD, small tasks become overwhelming so not sure if this is related. But still, when something is a boring task, I put it off. 

8. In high school, I would sometimes flirt with guys other girls liked because I could. I’m ashamed of this and don’t do it anymore. I guess I was 16 and 17 but still. I also remember in high school, I “needed” someone to talk to everyday and impress.

9. My mind picks out the smallest thing to obsess over in relationships. I think this was the OCD and it has gotten better, but still odd. And then I wouldn’t be able to sleep very well because of it. And then ruminate on it. 

10. Insisting I’m right when I know I’m wrong. On occasion, I’ve tried to prove a point to my partner when he’s clearly right. The specific instance I’m thinking of, he got worn down and said okay fine. I think I gaslit him and I feel awful. 

11. Terrible anxiety over things when I think people are upset with me. Again, this leads to not sleeping at times. I’ve also been known to text my partner when I can’t sleep even if it’s 4 am, not to try to wake him up but so they know I’m struggling. I’m now wondering if this is manipulation to make him feel bad for me. 

12. Quick to move on from relationships. Once someone has hurt me, or told me they don’t want to be with me, I’m really upset and mourn, but then move on. I try to find someone to distract me, usually just to talk to but just to help soothe the pain. 

Thank you for your help. I’m feeling very lost and confused. The OCD obsessions and compulsions have all been related to this and have made any sort of happiness impossible.",8
82,Are these Cluster B symptoms or am I just a tweaker?,PrimarySuit858,9,rlbeyt,2021-12-21 09:58:12,20,"Why I think I am BPD/NPD:
1. Domination of conversations (used to do this way more before someone pointed it out, now I make a concerted effort to allow others to speak)

2. Inability to lose (literally ask anybody in my life)

3. Grandiosity - people around me always think I am a visionary with huge aspirations (which is true), but tbh I see nothing wrong with this one at all… why would I want to live a normal life? I want to help humanity as much as I can so why would I think small?

4. Suicidal Ideation
    1. Planes (every time I fly, I don’t pray for it to go down, but I definitely think about how it would be nice to die in a plane crash and be remembered for my potential, while also never having anybody realize I was suicidal) and Cars (same thing, ugly car wreck freak accident)
    2. Hitting myself after losing a stupid hand (poker) or hitting a bad shot (tennis)

5. Cannot stay in a relationship or get close to anybody (nobody knows how I feel inside my brain except for me, lied to my therapist too because I didn’t want her to feel upset about my suicidal thoughts, plus didn’t want her to freak out because “I’m doing okay”)

6. Constantly thinking about how to avoid getting pushed in front of a train (because I also think about what if I just pushed somebody in front of a train)

7. When news comes out about bombing, shooting, etc, my first reaction is always “what an idiot, they could have killed so many more ppl if they did X, Y, Z.”, never remorse or empathy for the victims. Watched the NZ shootings and frequent subreddits that show murders and I don’t react the way I think I “should”

8. Most ironic one: the more I learn about NPD/BPD the more I feel like nobody understands it well enough to treat me except for myself, I feel like all the therapists I have tried are too stupid to understand (logical rational conclusion would be that I am not letting them in, thus they have no clue how to diagnose/treat me)

9. Aggrandizement of my life — this one actually fucks with my head because I don’t have a correct perception of things (grew up going to beach club/country club, mom/uncle are trust fund kids, sister/myself also likely have trusts, went to private school ages 3-18, grew up with multiple homes, nice vacations) however, I feel like I make it seem more elite than it was (mom lived in tiny house from 7-12 grade, dad house 7-8th grade was shithole, never felt “rich”). There’s no transparency on my mom’s side of $, I know every asset my Dad has because I had to pay his bills when he was in rehab for alcoholism. All super confusing but I definitely make it seem all plush and comfy.

10. Obsession with a having large family. I didn’t think this was a symptom until I learned about the family being a way to have security and loyalty because you are blood bound. Makes sense, I always have said the trait I value most in a friend is loyalty.

11. Weird thing, idk if it’s a PD symptom but have always been curious. I have to listen to everything on numbers that end with 0 or 5. This includes wake up times, bed times, the time I leave the house, tv volume, etc. Anything you can think of, also have to leave perfect tips (47.78 -> 47.78 + 7.22 = $55)

12. Whenever someone gets “cancelled”, I am always anxious that everybody is out to get me and I’m next. Causes extreme anxiety and at some points could not sleep unless high.

13. Weird things: 
    1. do a lot of random nice favors for people on the street, but why? 
    2. Super easy to convince to go out? Is this low self esteem? What causes this? Abandonment? FOMO?

14. Always forget birthdays/don’t get gifts. This one changes when I’m dating someone though, I am always great at finding thoughtful gifts.

15. Massive womanizer; less so recently but had a 4 year stretch where would cycle through women like nobody’s business and lose interest as soon as I had them in my grasp. Also “love to play the game” with women.

16. The celebration of death: I hate when people celebrate the dead and leave out their flaws. I don’t know why, this is something that makes me super mad and also makes me feel like people are stupid and don’t want to admit that people aren’t perfect. My preliminary analysis on why I feel this way is probably because of how shitty I feel about my own self esteem and how shitty of a person I know I have been to people, yet how highly people would see me if I were to die today.

17. Mom always called me “the peacemaker” because I always tried to keep the peace in the household; when I wasn’t short fused about losing a game that was

18. I’m not into social media hardly at all, and I don’t really ever feel the need to “flex” on people in my life. I put people in their place when they flex on me, but I don’t feel like I flex hardly ever

19. An obsession with people who “get it” for example, Beth Dutton in Yellowstone or Mickey Pearson in The Gentlemen.",9

(fyi im planning to go to therapy, and ive been doing some research about the disorder)(well its impossible for me to look into articles cause of demonization of the mental disorder.)

So for context:

It has been manifesting since the beginning of 2021? I've been a little bit disorderly, obsessive and compulsive. The fake fantasies in my head has been playing and playing.

My ego has also been inflating, like alot. Like it's unhealthy self love and obsession. I'd range from being like ""I'm god! I AM TRULY GOD. I AM GOD, everyone loves  me, I will play out this obsession will throw the people who have wronged me under the bus and they will cry and beg for a million apologies, while I stare at them angry and disillusioned at them, and I will be reborn new again"" while holding back my tears. Or my switch will be flipped and I will straight up feel suicidal, and play up a million scenarios where#I want to straight up commit suicide or feel like shallow, and nobody's going to help me.)

I didn't have a outright violent childhood, it was somewhat normal, but it's toxic.  My dad isn't that sympathetic towards me, neither my mom if I experience some sort of distress, and don't know what to do with my suicidal behaviours.  Sometimes my dad would treat me like garbage and hurt me with his casual ""do you need to go to the mental hospital vibes"" the place I'm in is toxic and somewhat distressful. I just relived a memory where he assaulted me and just yelled at me a year ago, while I was crying, and it was so painful for me that I had to block the memories. And they just take it as me  being manipulative, which i dont want to vent about my problems to a bunch of strangers, but i didnt have that much support in my years. Also i got backstabbed and stomped upon, so thats even worse

last but not least, im starting to be angry and resentful like my dad. he has alot of temper issues, anger issues (i think) and he is often scary when he gets really angry, which means i dont feel this safe in my home/. which manifests my unhealthy clinging problems towards others and the need to vent and the massive adoration to feel this loved and in constant euphoria is getting to my head. maybe my love is manifesting toxic, maybe im not this good at loving even now, and i just want the pain to stop.

what should i really do..........? tell me?",8
86,Bitter,slumberqueen_,9,q4suc8,2021-10-09 20:01:59,0,"Does anyone else feel like they're becoming bitter just like their parents? In the beginning I felt justified for doing it because I saw it as me finally sticking up for myself. Now I'm realizing it's just getting out of hand and I'm behaving childishly. My mother rarely tries her manipulative behaviors with me anymore because I've just become so defensive and controlling, just like she was with me when I was younger. I hate it. It's not what I wanted. I wanted respect, but it seems like she's only calmed down out of fear instead of actual respect. I feel like I'm slowly becoming my mother. The passive aggression, temper tantrums, random outbursts, not being direct when I feel frustrated and then being angry when I'm not understood or being listened to. I actually feel like a huge bitch and I don't want to exist anymore. I can't handle problems the right way. The way I always hoped I could. No matter how hard I try my anger gets the best of me and I react inappropriately. Then I have to look like a fool and apologize after realizing it was inappropriate. Sometimes I don't even apologize when I fear it'll just happen again and then I'll let someone else down. I've changed so much these past years and my progress feels like little to none. I don't feel like I'll be able to survive in the real world.",9
87,"How do I stop being so fucking insecure, CAN'T STAND JEALOUSY",ensnsowpforke,8,rpcgu2,2021-12-27 02:34:35,7,"

I can’t stand feeling jealousy!!! 

I’m not that jealous of other peoples appearances but it’s like other people are probably attracted to someone else over me.. you get me?

Like I can’t stand seeing someone who I probably don’t have a chance with (if I’m the opposite of their type for example).

It makes me BOIL! I get so angry and get this burning feeling in my chest. Please give me some tips, mediations etc ANYTHING

Jealousy is that one feeling I wish I could remove",8
88,Vent,_ilikebread_,3,rqlydt,2021-12-28 18:15:29,4," I posted an insta story asking if anyone would like to invite me to a/their Sylvester party.. well 30 ppl read it and I got no answer. To add to that I'm the kid who never gets invited anywhere, an I mean NEVER. Growing up I've never had a friend group, now I have no one that I feel emotionally close to. Also the fact that they do this partying  and friendship thing implies that they're better than me which is something I can NOT let happen. 

Like wtf am I doing wrong? I don't look bad, I maintain proper hygiene and I'm smart, smarter than kost of them (IQ) and I act friendly towards everyone and even pretend to care about what they're saying. So why am I always the worst or the last choice or simply the girl that gets overlooked?
And honestly, I don't know I should feel about that: I've already thought about multiple scenarios that I could initiate:

1. I pretend to be very mentally unwell (which I am btw) and thus score sympathy points just like I tried from the 7th grade on where I was considering jumping out of the window and having the fantasy that someone would stop me and everyone would dramatically gather around me and shower me with apologies and sympathy.... but it didn't work so I'm not certain that it will this time

2. Isolation. Completely retreat from society and play the 'mysterious loner' that means on new years eve I'll go into the city on my own, buy myself a bottle of wine and proceed to drink it while sitting sad on a bench or something. I'd start going to the gym again and maybe they'll finally pay attention when I look better than all of them (now I'm about half way there) Like why do I not have a boyfriend? I'm skinny, have visible abs and my face is not that bad too but for some reason I've never even had my first kiss. Plus hearing people rank about whom they've already made out with at my age makes my blood boil, like 'why does this not happen to me' and 'now I am even lower on the social hierarchy and look even worse in front of everyone'
Also btw am somewhat incompetent at maintaining relationships since idk what the hell people talk about. Is it life experiences? Too bad, because I remember almost nothing before 10th grade (13years). Like how do people keep that up? I seriously wanna know? Because in one hand, my therapist told me that affective empathy is only possible if you like yourself, even though a lot of people dont like themselves and they still got friends somehow. Hell, some don't even deserve the amount of friends they have which means at even those who are much less worth than me still have a better social life.

3. Revenge: The amount of anger I feel is pretty high ngl, which is kinda weird because I feel both like I can't feel any anger but then at the same time I have the urge to tell them to just go fuck themselves and get revenge for what they've done which may make them fear me which in return finally gives me some ounce of respect and maybe then ppl will start to associate with me.
Because for some reason I don't care about emotional intimacy, because you can just fake it and because I know that that'll never happen to me lol and the othe. And furthermore friendships or specifically having a social life kinda builds this image of yourself in which you are worth something because you're somewhat high in the social hierarchy which ofc makes you look good and thus you're better than other (which is like my only legitimate goal in life, to be better than those people I come in contact with and yes it's unrealistic but still, can't allow myself to be worse no matter which aspect of life lmaooo)

Holy damn this was long.. if you made it to here: wow you're bored/ but also thank you cause I feel that this is the only place where I can vent my thoughts that some would probably understand . 

FYI IM NOT CLINICALLY DIAGNOSED!! I just feel like almost everything in this the most relatable shit I've heard lol so// also because I'm a minor too

89,NPD Journey: covert narcissistic rage [+some facts],mushymarshfellows,8,mg1ipy,2021-03-29 22:38:25,2,"Today was an interesting day indeed. I got triggered by what was said last about my partner is regards to a relative (she's somewhat passive and seems to be weak, at least to me, because she always seems to over explain herself). I cried and felt angry even. I knew my partner was right but still. I threw stuff and exited the room to another bathroom. I sat there and thought about how unsafe I felt regarding my 'mother' and how I felt upset about crying/expressing emotion. The main jist is that it's not weak to show emotions...maybe it's just who we choose to trust. Anyways, this the 2nd rage since almost a month ago.

I think the last intense emotion I expressed was sadness and anger while I was in the bathroom, just wanting to be left alone. This was also near the time in which I browsed r/raisedbynarcissists
As of late, I've cared more about people and had a sense of solidarity towards people coexisting. There was a period of time where I tried to work on empathy but that felt worthless but it's for sure not. It's nice to feel like everyone is at least decent to each other. 

Also felt very homicidal after said blood relative moved my food out of the microwave but I know it's my fault for leaving it there. 

Digressing, I've been told my own worst enemy is myself and I really hate it. To think I felt like I wasn't a narcissist anymore haha. I really hope I don't ruin a very good thing I have going in my life and I've made progress (5% in the overall I'm betting). If you'd like to talk about your experiences or chat, I'm here. Thank you for reading all of this if you have. I plan to be more active here and I'm interested in making either a youtube channel dedicated towards NPD and education but also trying things out that may help. So much B.S. out there and not all of it's accurate but I understand where the hate comes from",8
90,A fucked up and undeserving mess.,stupidthrowaway5678,12,lt05os,2021-02-26 15:36:02,3,"Hi, Im 21 and struggling with intense shame and self hatred with the person I used to be. Im not diagnosed with npd, but i am bpd with narcissistic traits. Ive changed a lot over the past couple years, but thinking back to the turbulent chaotic being I used to be fills me with self hatred. I feel like for the first time in my life Im finally sober, and as painful as that is Im also very grateful to finally be free. I grew up in a broken home with a narcissistic father and and a bipolar mother. their marriage fell apart and there was intense fighting where things would sometimes get physical. I was already a bit of turbulent kid, probably due to genetics but my dysfunctional parents combined with my shitty school life turned me into a disaster. Both me and my sister ended up becoming very toxic individuals, just in different ways. My sister become very emotionally and occasionally physically abusive towards people, especially my mom. I became a very emotionally stunted and angry teenager, and while I rarely ever lashed out at people, I treated my pets incredibly poorly. 

I had would hit my dogs occasionally when they misbehaved, especially my one dog who was very hyperactive and frequently created large messes and chew on my belongings. It was such a bad combination and not a day goes by that I dont hate myself for how I treated her. We werent at all prepared for a dog like her and I was probably the worst to her. It was so bizarre because while I was capable of being a very empathetic person, when my dog would upset me it would all vanish. One day I got so bad I must've had some kind of psychotic meltdown and almost stabbed her. I knew even in the moment that I wouldnt actually do it, but still what a fucking monstrosity I was. I was so messed up and every time I mistreated her I always felt awful afterwards and promised to be better, but I still had moments where my anger would get the better of me and I would yell or hit her. I had also hit my other dog a couple times, though this was mostly as a kid. though even as a teenager I would occasionally take out my frustration on him. I also had a few occasions where I hurt my sister, usually in defense of my mother whom she would abuse but still it was always excessive and completely unnecessary. 


What makes it all so much worse is that every time I did something like this I would always feel so awful, and yet I had almost no control over my emotions. I know now that I had some pretty significant mental issues that had gone untreated, but that will never excuse what I had done. This isn't even all of it, but probably the worst of it. Some things were done just out of not knowing any better, others were not. I hate myself because there are those who have gone through far worse than me and yet have caused much less harm than me. I guess I just soaked up more evil growing up. I was usually surrounded by toxic people and was very impressionable. I also had very little self discipline and control which I think was the biggest contributing factor. There have been some especially bad times where I was with some very gross and malevolent people but I would prefer not to go into that. I'll be honest with you, while Ive improved a lot Im still a pathetic, emotionally stunted and neurotic little child. Im diagnosed with adhd and ocd as well, and there's a decent chance im autistic. As crazy as it sounds, all Ive wanted from the very beginning was to be a lovable, normal and good person. I still want that and Im so scared Im being alone and unlovable. Thats why it hurts so bad because I know I deserve to be alone. Im surrounded by friends who love me but they dont know the real me, and what Ive done. I cant accept their love and affection abd every day I want to just cut them off, but Im too scared to make new friends and Im terrified of further isolation. I've spent most of my adolescence in isolation, avoiding the world and barely talking to people including my own family. I think that intense isolation also did significant damage to me. I was essentially living the covid lifestyle except pre covid, though it was probably much worse than even that.

 Im so screwed up, more screwed up than I could ever convey with my words. I dont know why or how I ended up this way, all I know is just want to be a good and normal person. I treat my dogs and all the people in my life as well as I possibly can, and Im always trying to go out of my way to be a better person. All I want is a chance to change. I have so many mistakes, too many and the shame I feel is insurmountable. Every day Im consumed with self hatred. But perhaps thats a fitting punishment for someone like me. I like to sit with the pain now and try and feel it in its entirety. Its satisfying, in a way. To suffer because of my mistakes. It feels like Im getting what I deserve.  I feel like its through this pain that one day I might feel Im worthy of change and forgiveness. But for now I must live with the pain and regret and soak in it. I dont know, maybe this post is just another desperate cry for attention. Ive always loved attention. Im not sure what the point of this was honestly. I just hope one day I can heal my broken soul. What do you guys think? I have so many problems but a lot of the time I think Im just making it all up and that Im crazy. I feel crazy a lot of the time due to my bpd and ocd so its so hard to tell if Im processing my feelings and shame in the right way. Im constantly second guessing myself and gaslighting myself. Im kind of a paranoid mess. I dont know.  This is mostly just a ramble at this point but if you've read this far, thank you. I appreciate it.",12
91,I think this is a narc trait that I really dislike,redditred88,14,k1nr6h,2020-11-26 21:26:50,18,"
If I am interested in a guy or like a guy & he treats me wrong.. I feel like I ignore it easily if I know/believe he has feelings for me. But if I imagine him having feelings for another girl or think he might actually like another girl more.. It makes me really mad. Even though this isn’t a logical reason to be mad except the guy is playing with my feelings- but that still shouldn’t result in anger. Like in my head I want to go up and scream/yell at them in rage insults and call him names. It’s really just out of my own hurt/shame that the guy could like another girl. But I don’t think it’s fair to get angry and want to tear someone down for liking someone else.

I do have adhd which causes issue with emotions but this isn’t a reason I should be upset. I actually score as 4 on the NPD test and as not a narcissist but I for sure have low self esteem to the point where if I never took adhd meds and sat and thought abt my narcissistic mom and how it put negative traits on me.. I feel like id have all the traits.",14

It’s like being on a drug to believe the delusions, to really believe you’re as special as you think. But it’s not reality. Reality fucking stings when you see you aren’t who you really think you are. But reality hurts. I’ve crashed hard into reality a few times an become incredibly suicidal.

You know they don't have it, they act like they do irresponsibly. You get overly upset.

But you behave this same way sometimes. And deep down you know it's because you hate that about yourself.

Or even projection itself. You see someone behaving in a manner you are familiar with, and then you assume they feel a certain way. Eg. Someone sitting calmly and quietly at an event where everyone else is socializing. You assume they are nervous and have social anxiety.

94,"Repressing my emotions gave me this raging, childish mentality in older years.",aiowaitre,23,nnk1q4,2021-05-29 09:47:32,4,"I was severely traumatised when I was two by basically what one would consider a kidnapping. After that, my parents noticed I'd cry at everything. Since a child's brain is very much developing at that age, I'm pretty sure that event caused me permanent damage and wired my brain to produce tears at stresses normal people would get simply annoyed or inconvenienced by.

My father saw crying as ""evil"" and ""weak"". If I cried, I'd get yelled at, hit, and more details I won't go into. I never was taught to deal with my emotions, and never was allowed to even express them. My narcissistic traits definitely come from the attention I was given as a child (being accelerated, everyone put me on a higher pedestal and worshipped me at school, and I had good creative talents people would fawn over back then).

What came out of that, afterwards? Whenever something wouldn't go my way, whenever someone annoyed me, I wanted to put them in their place. I'd lie and cry and fabricate stories to get them in trouble—the equivalent of throwing a tantrum. Even now, I have raging desires to do that, but the risk of the law keeps me in check. 

I may have typical academic and lifestyle knowledge of my age, and I may know how to communicate with others very well now, but inside, my ego, my anger and my fear and desire to be appreciated? It's always going to be a vulnerable, tantrum-throwing child, and my narcissistic traits are there to hide that child.",23

I’m thinking about either cutting it off, yelling at her or fucking some other girl. Just so I can walk away on top. 

I was pretty damn happy as of late, and when I’m with her in person everything is great. But I can’t fucking deal with it anymore.

99,Starting to get scared of myself,TemporaryCorner5688,25,rc28uz,2021-12-08 22:05:57,3,"This is going to be really long (sorry in advance). So basically, I'm not diagnosed with NPD, but my psychiatrist says I have strong traits, and from what I've researched I am the definition of a covert narcissist. Also I'm dyslexic so the spelling and grammar is horrible. The first bit is just background for context and not necessary to read:

Background (not super important): 

I'll give some background. 2 years ago I started dating my ex boyfriend (we are both in our early 20s, I'm a female). He was really sweet, had some mental health problems, and 'fell in love' with me almost immediately. He had allot of relationship anxiety and unhealthy attachment issues, and so did I. We dated for a bit over a year. In this time I completely lied about everything. I pretty much reinvented myself to match someone he would want. At first I didn't really like him, but soon fell in love and I became completely obsessed with him. Our relationship was super intense and unhealthy, as we both had so many issues, but at its basis I really do think I loved him. I loved spending time with him, I loved talking to him etc. but now I'm starting to wonder if I actually loved him, or was it just obsession because I had no one else and I liked the way he made me feel. I'm not sure. 

I had immense relationship anxiety, but I'm starting to realise that allot of what I thought was 'anxiety' was just moments where I couldn't control him, and these moment where I had no control over him, and I felt powerless made me anxious.

He thought I was the sweetest, most honest, girlfriend ever, when in reality it was just a facade. I was super toxic and manipulative, and was really good at hiding it. I would purposefully go out of my way to invent stories about guys flirting with me, made up exes, told him I had pervious relationships even if he was my first, show him pics of guys I had things with in the past that were hotter than him to make him insecure. All of this just to make him jealous and insecure. To create this image that I was hot shit. I was using dating apps and talking to guys I had things with in the past throughout the entire relationship, purely for attention, and moments when I was super anxious and thought he was cheating on me. At its basis all the things I would do were because I was just so insecure, but wanted to feel like I had power and control over the situation.

I had just moved to a new city when I met him, and didn't know anyone. I had a few friends, but all of them knew a 'different' part of me, as I just mirror the people that I'm around, plus I was embarrassed of them and was scared that my ex would not like them or think they were 'cool' enough. So he never met any of them. I made up so many people and friends, would talk to him about people that didn't exist just so he thought I was super popular. I also grew up in a different country, and never made friends there either (because I'm clearly just not a pleasant person and everyone irritates me after a while), but would still make people up so he thought I was this super popular person in highschool, when I was actually the lame, weirdo with  no friends. It was easy to keep all of this and my family hidden, as there was lockdown. I was terrified he would meet my family or anyone I knew and find out about all my lies. 

We dated for a bit over a year, until I ended up cheating on him with his brother. This happened a year ago. I had met his brother briefly once, he was older and didn't live in the same city as us. The night before I cheated, I went to a party with my ex, his brother, and some of their friends and cousins. That night I became obsessed with the brother. I felt drawn to him, like we had something that others didn't (I think he has NPD too actually). The day after, I saw him again and kissed him. I initiated it. That night my ex wasn't there, but there were some of their friends, and obviously his brother. I was completely drunk, and on allot of drugs (was the first time in the relationship I had ever taken drugs). I can't remember allot, but apparently the way I acted, and the stuff I said made the brother and his friends realise and tell my ex that I'm a sociopath. 

Background (a bit more important):

Looking back the emotions I felt after I cheated were not normal. I don't think I felt any empathy for him. I felt allot of shame. So much shame that my mask was ripped off. That people close to him saw the 'real me'. So basically all I have been doing since the cheating is trying to make my ex see me for who he thought I was, not who his brother is telling him I am. I told him I would start super intensive therapy to fix myself so we could get back together. In reality my intention for starting therapy had nothing to do with me trying to fix myself, it was to do with the fact that I wanted him to think I was, so he would take me back. I put on this personal to my new therapist, to come across as super innocent, that it was all a mistake. I would have my ex sit in the room while I had my therapist on loudspeaker over the phone, I would feed my therapist shit, so that I knew he would reply telling me how great I was, how much improvement I had made etc. all just so my ex would hear. It worked for several months, he was still completely obsessed with me. I would always tell him how we should stop talking and seeing each-other, how what I did was so fucked up, that I wanted to become a better person before we got back together. But I didn't mean any of it, it was just to see if he would fight for me. And he did. He would beg for me to stay. I was still tell him I was hanging out with all these guys so he would be jealous, still do all this manipulative shit even after I cheated. Through all this we were never officially dating again, but  acting like we were (he was keeping it hidden from everyone). After a while I think that the reality of what I did hit, and he decided he wanted to properly end things. Before he was always saying how in a few months we'd get together, that I was the one, that he was sure we would end up together as we're meant to be. Then he started saying how he didn't know if we would ever even end up together, that it was life, and shit happens. He started seeing the whole situation from a more mature place. I think his family also really ingrained this idea in his head that I was a sociopath. We went a few months without talking, however always end up talking and seeing eachother. But there's no desperation on his part anymore. He takes ages to reply, I have to literally beg him to come over, he only really talks to me or wants to see me when he's depressed or lonely. I'm still now I'm manipulating him.

Important part:

Now to the important part. A month after I cheated I did a shit tonne of psychedelics for the first time. It was horrible. The entire trip was just hallucinations telling me how I'm rotten to my core, my blood isn't pure, I come from a line of people whose blood is in-pure. That the only way to stop this was to kill myself. I was super freaked out after, but ignored it. A month after that I smoked allot of weed, and relived the entire experience in more detail. It made me realise so many behaviours I had that were not ok. Then I while after I smoked again, and again realised even more stuff. Before this I honestly thought I was a good person with good intentions lol. Around 6 months ago is when I started doing allot of research into my behaviours, joining this forum, researching about NPD etc. and I realised that this is what I have. That I lie, I manipulate, I'm a completely empty vessel, I just mirror then discard people when I don't need them anymore, I only care about myself and how I appear to others, nothing in my life or about me is real, because I live in a world of fantasies 99% of these time, I think I'm so superior when in reality I am and have nothing. All of these things, I have. When I first realised I completely broke down. I told my mum everything (she completely denied it and said that there's no way I have NPD. That's just how good my mask is). I started telling my therapist the truth, and we started working on it. I became completely suicidal, realising that I'm the reason that my life has always been horrible and I have no one. Then I would forget about it and stop going on this forum, and I'd be ok for a while. I kept repeating these cycles of forgetting all about NPD, and being ok in myself, and becoming obsessed with NPD, and wanting to kill myself. The thing is now, when I think about the stuff I did to my ex I actually think I DO feel empathy. He was such a pure soul and I hurt him so much. I physically feel how I hurt him inside of me. However, I still can't stop myself manipulating him. I've for sure gotten better, but I still lie to him about so much in regards to the cheating and myself, just to preserve the mask. He's the one I have it the worst with, because the mask I present him is complete lies. This brings me to last week, where I started watching documentaries of criminal psychiatrists braking down serial killers profiles, and psychopath's behaviours in interviews. And I do all the things they do. Everything they point in regards to their  manipulations, is stuff I do. Everything down to the rehearsing, the facial expressions, the tone, playing the victim, being charming. Everything. It's me. And now I'm terrified that I will do something like that one day. That I will actually truly hurt someone. Loose it and kill someone. I'm confused though because when I hear about what they did, I do feel empathy and feel completely sick. But what if I loose it one day, in the moment so blinded my anger that I kill or hurt someone. I have also been going on the narcissistic abuse subreddit allot, and it's been fucking with me. Reading these stories and how the behaviours of the people they talk about  are just as mine, realising how fucked up it is hearing from it from the other side. It brings me so much shame, and I think also  empathy for the people effected. At the same time, when I read it, I look back at my behaviours with my ex, making sure that I hid them well enough for him to never realise that I'm also a manipulative narcissist. I want. to get better so bad. Stop hurting people. Have a stable life. Not constantly live in fear that someone will find out about my many lies. I don't know what to do. No matter how hard I try I feel like at it's rooted in me. I have literally always been like this, and I think I always be, it's how I'm programmed and it scares me.

Please help me.",FrOCD1998,19,qtz4qn,2021-11-14 20:51:07,37,"Hey guys, so basically I have ocd and am very very codependent. Always have been, when my ex broke up with me I went to grippy sock jail for attempted forever box slumber. I met my new gf and shit was sick, I was attracted to her aura and boom we dated a few years later and now we’ve  lived together for 3 months. Pretty much our whole relationship has been hard. She’s very afraid to be vulnerable with me due to having lost almost everyone in her life unexpectedly, so I’m obviously just a potential loss. This means apologies, emotional conversation or talking much aren’t really on the table.

Currently shits been better, she’s been trying to be open but i have this one thing I’m stuck on. Throughout our relationship I always felt like I did communicating she couldn’t do. She’s not a big talker, like I said, so I would go and introduce her to people and help bridge a lot of gaps because I’m very very social. It’s paid off for her and she has a lot of friends now, but I feel like it’s all a lie and I should tell them what it was like behind closed doors? Because she was very resistant, kind of like someone snapping at you for being to afraid of getting on a roller coaster. They never saw the fights and I always told everyone she was an angel so are all her friendships lies that I created because I’m the awesome one who still chose to make her out to be great because I’m a good guy? And now I should tell them the truth? 

She’s gonna say I’m a narc if I say this but it’s how it feels. Like I’m the nice guy who stayed with the broken girl because I’m too nice and understanding and now I’m done and want to expose it all? I know she’s just insecure and hurting so it wasn’t a lie that she’s awesome, but more so me telling people “aye she ain’t gonna tell you but she’s a dope dude”, and now that I’m seeing that a lot of her behaviors, even if they are mistakes, are messed up and hurt me alot. I took away from interactions I could’ve had with my friends to help her be built up as this awesome person. I sacrificed my big giant moments I could’ve had because she was always projecting the insecurity of me drawing attention upsetting her. I feel like if her and my friends knew that they wouldn’t be her friends. 

I don’t know, I’m upset and I don’t know what to do and I’m depressed as all hell. Hair is legit falling out of my head with a slight tug. Finally, she has this new friend she made and I can’t tell if I’m idealizing her? She’s the usual tom-boy emo girl type I’m in to, but has more “social swagger” as I’ve called it than my gf and when I asked my gf if she wanted to learn that, she didn’t seem to care much for it. I feel bad, even today my gf said she wasn’t invited somewhere that her friend was and I was like “see she’d definitely say fuck your friendship to date me” but then that feels super fucked. 

Idk whats happening but it sucks. I do devalue my partner outside of legit issues with the whole “why can’t you be more social” “why can’t you drink more” “why don’t you dress more like this” “why don’t you laugh at this or enjoy these jokes all your friends love me telling”

101,I think I have covert NPD and I'll say why.,Rarefatbeast,8,r5cl0l,2021-11-30 02:39:30,17,"I get easily offended by certain things sometimes, other times I don't. It varies in my mood. I get very upset when I'm wrong. 

I have social anxiety. I seem to use self pity to gain sympathy. I can get very jealous of other people for certain things.

I take things personally when someone is talking about other things. Eg. When watching a movie about cheating, it gives me feelings of spousal cheating in my relationship. Or if someone is going through a divorce it makes me think of my situation 
I have some level of a self elevated ego. Sometimes im quick to blame others. I can be mean to others close to me or myself in joking ways. I care what others think but I'm often lazy.

What makes me think I don't:

I truly believe I'm not a good person, and there is a lot of self hate. I have empathy. I'm an empathy crier or whatever it's called. I can admit when I'm wrong a lot and question that it's me but not someone else in a situation. I can try to understand how others feel. I give without expecting anything in return (however sometimes I think may be virtue signaling).

I often have suicidal thoughts, but I vocally express these too often to those close to me.

I'm also very judgemental and hateful towards drug users or alcoholics, because I used to be one myself.

What opinion do you have on my thought process? I've seen docs before but I'm not sure I'm getting a proper diagnosis...",8
102,Narcissistic rage,ImfrenchThankGod,0,pgko4j,2021-09-02 15:55:34,4,"People say that narcissistic rage is not justified or that it's an exaggeration but that's ludicrous. I can't make others relate to it at all since only narcissists experience this overwhelming anger. Have you ever been in situation in which you were denied some basic right you're entitled to **at the expense** of someone who was truly less talented than you? The kind of situation in which someone who just happens to be a tiny bit luckier gets a promotion?...or someone from a slightly poorer nation gets access to a visa waiver whereas you don't,in spite of being richer? And reacted violently to that?
 But that's not even the real rage. The wrath comes when I iterate this utter injustice and someone gets angry at ME for pointing it out. I told someone it's fucking retarded and he got mad at me and insulted me or told me something like ""it's your fault"" or whatever. That very moment I nearly exploded. I wanted to punch headbutt him,then lunch him again and again and again untiI broke MY bones and could no longer clench my fists. Then grab a stone off the road and smash his head with it or bite off his face while looking into his eyes as I scratch his face with my fingers until I tear off all the fat in his cheeks only for me to rip off his tongue out of his mouth or his eyes. Words can't describe how angry that made me feel. It was like a neverending outburst of fury got into my whole body,it was so intense my left foot kept shivering  from the knee down. Could barely control myself and as I get older (I'm 20) controlling it gets more difficult. I want to do it and look at his shitty face as I do it then whisper that it's his fault into his ear. Idk if you have ever experienced something so intense but that's narcissistic rage for me.

And I struggle to make normal people understand it. Any tips?",0

I get angry to the point of shaking, my heart racing and not being able to see straight. This can be triggered by the tiniest criticism- or perceived criticism- and I’ll be so angry I’ll want to get revenge on the person. Not necessarily in a violent way, though.

I have BPD with multiple significant narcissistic traits that disrupt my day to day life, though I haven’t explicitly been diagnosed with NPD as of right now. It’s not fun. And my anger gets so out of hand it alarms me. I’m sure this post comes off as me trying to be edgy or whatever, but that’s not my goal here. I’m trying to see if anyone relates and because I’m curious about what narcissistic rage is like for others.

This year I’ve come to the realization that I’m either a huge covert narc or I picked up narcissistic fleas from my narcissistic father. I was an only child to a single parent and was consistently spoiled and babied by everyone around me all my life. 

I always knew I was self centered. But I’m having a come to Jesus moment in which i’m realizing that I’m a horrible daughter, relative, and friend and altogether just not as considerate or kind as I thought I was. I’m very quick to write people off when they upset me or don’t align with my projected image for my life. 

I don’t think I want to be this way anymore. There are parts of narcissism that I do enjoy and find a sick satisfaction in but overall, I don’t want to have such a fragile ego anymore and I want to be more considerate of others.

107,i wonder if i’m a narcissist?,lkeane20,4,pssu32,2021-09-21 21:40:53,1,"i’m not sure where to vent about this (therapy isn’t an option at the moment), so i’ll give it a whirl here: i wonder if i’m a covert narcissist. maybe someone can give me insight. i hope i’m not offending anyone by posting this, that’s the last thing i want to do.

i say this because i figured out that i’ve been putting in a facade for years that i’m this sweet, lovely, harmless person when my actions say the opposite. i’ve been problematic for quite some time. albeit, i was abused by my narcissistic boyfriend for 5 years (i treated him badly in return over time), and i’m still being abused by my mom who is also a narcissist. 

i find myself acting like my mom because she’s displayed her toxic behaviors to me since i was very young and still does. i learned all of my toxic behaviors from her. she used to gloat about being able to manipulate people and i thought it was an advantage she had. when in reality, it’s not. her and my ex have pushed my buttons in more ways than one so i started acting like them in return when i was hurt. i mirrored their actions. it also started happening even when i wasn’t appeared to be hurt. i’d act this way if i was just trying to get my way. 

a lot of the time i feel like the world should revolve around me, and when it’s not i become depressed. when the attention is on someone else i get jealous. it makes me wonder if i’m really good enough, and when i get into depressed moods like this it’s followed by anger. because feeling pain always made me feel weak. i want to be powerful. 

i’ve lost a lot of people in my life, and i’m beginning to believe it was truly my fault. i’ve victimized myself a lot, and i’m tired of pretending i’m a victim. the truth is, i stopped being a victim the moment i acted like my abusers. i have wronged many people. many people have also wronged me. it’s a vicious cycle. i turn into a nasty, nasty person when i’m angry or hurt. i say despicable things. 

i’m not sure who i am anymore and i’m wondering if someone can give me an opinion. i should definitely talk to a professional about this, but i don’t know if i’m losing my mind or not. i’m having a bit of an identity crisis at the moment.

edit: i want to mention i’ve been diagnosed with AvPD, PPD, and BPD by professionals. but this has never come up",4

109,How do you get past the shame -> failure cycle? How do you force yourself to stay sane and present?,much-clouds,40,npo23q,2021-06-01 07:10:31,23,"I'm a narcissist with both covert and overt behaviours, my life is a constant cycle of:

- Mistake 
- Defensiveness (Insisting I'm right, instinctively and involuntarily lying to cover up my failure) 
- Suffering (Loss, criticism/hate from others etc.)
- Shame, Fear, Frustration 
- Counter-productive Coping (Avoiding the person/situation/topic, forgetting information/the entire incident, blanking out and ignoring problems even with obvious physical evidence)
- Return to mistake 

I hate this. I'm stuck in this cycle and it's ruining my life, it destroys my ability to learn and grow (I repeat mistakes for decades), makes me ruin everything I touch (Furniture damaged from neglect, room reeking of week-old laundry, journals reeking from sweat and tears etc.) and worst of all, inconveniences and pisses off everybody I get too close to (Undone chores/tasks, insane forgetfulness, constant instinctive arrogance that I'm blind to unless it's pointed out which is obviously disgusting and irritating for everyone who notices).

I feel like my brain is actually somehow decaying from this. I do the cycle above, anger someone and subsequently break down in depressive and frustrated crying raging fits basically every night. If not physically then somewhat internally mentally. 

It's gotten worse over the years. As I slog on I forget more, I lie more and I'm arrogant more all without realizing because my stupid brain actually seems to think forgetting and being less aware of my flaws is a great survival strategy. 

It seems my brain has nothing but BLINDLY AGREE/FIGHT/CONDESCEND/PLAY VICTIM/ERASE MEMORY ACT DUMB/DUMB SILENCE mode. It's like these are the only options it chooses from, and I won't realize until it's too late and I've said something that everyone finds atrocious.

111,How to continue with this relationship? Advice?,Different_Ad8318,17,r8ymq9,2021-12-04 20:42:00,6,"I have recently gotten my official diagnosis for NPD and while it somehow is relieving, therapy has given me a lot to think about. 

My therapist and I have recently specifically discussed my current relationships and it has forced me to really think about my relationship with my partner. I had really convinced myself I genuinely cared and loved this person. Our relationship is pretty stable, we communicate well etc. I has been the healthiest relationship I’ve been in so far.

However, taking a deeper look at what I value about him makes me realise I just wanted to prove to myself I could have a healthy and happy relationship- like other people do. And how I enjoy feeling needed by someone. My boyfriend is emotionally quite dependent on me and because of that he lets some of my manipulative traits and laziness in doing chores slide. 

It makes me frustrated because I want to love like other people do. I see it- but it seems so out of reach for me. Like I can’t really comprehend what it is like to see someone and genuinely feel joy when something good has happened to them. Or genuinely value them as a person. 

Whenever I ask about his day I just don’t genuinely care, I just pretend. I have doubts about our future, for more reasons than just the fact that I don’t love him. I’m scared he’ll find out how I truly feel and I’m scared of being alone.

And even in all this I feel more ashamed and I’m wallowing is self-pity more than I think about his feelings in all of this. 

I don’t know what to do. I know I sound extremely selfish. But the realisation has made me very upset and I feel embarrassed and like a failure.

113,Anyone have stories of hope re NPD?,Ottowa-9,11,ov5p5u,2021-07-31 11:44:33,5,"tl;dr - can narcissists change, be happy, and still aspirational?

Been dealing with psychological upset for a couple of years now; first it was depression/anxiety (the easiest, catch all diagnosis (no wonder rates are so high)) but once those were solved I continued to feel dissatisfied and angry, which caused a feedback loop to the depressive and anxious feelings.   


For a while I thought it was PPD or something worse, but my internal feelings never quite matched up with them. Nor bipolar. The internal grandiosity, in my view, was always at a contrast to where I quite was/am in life, and has been that which causes my anxiety - the idea I am not where my mind demands I be. After coming across NPD in the DSM, a lot of my thoughts and feelings make more sense, and I'm getting an evaluation to either confirm or deny this so that I can improve on this situation.   


But at the same time, I wonder if that is just hopeless. The internet is awash with support groups for narc abuse, and the general vibe is that everyone should keep away from narcissists because they're beyond help. Personally, I would hope that (if this is indeed what I am dealing with) I'd be able to overcome the desire not to change. But then again, it all seems unfair that I am the one who is supposed to change when much of narcissism seems to come down to the fundamental idea that the individual is not satisfied with being dealt the cards they have in a life that they didn't ask for, and so the question becomes: ""why is it such an affront to humanity that in a sea of people who will mean nothing in the grand scheme of even short-term history that, if I am forced to participate, I should not want with every fiber of my being to be somewhat notable or significant? Why is it that I should just be content with having, comparatively, nothing when others are simply given by birthright (especially in the UK) the path to wealth, power, education, ability, looks...?""

I’ll leave why I think my  mom is a narcissist in the comments.. she says she’s only mean to my as a reaction to me and my own abuse. My whole family is against me and trashes me. It makes me feel like I really am the problem. But my dads head perks up when she walks by and he begins screaming at me and he’s afraid of her. I just can’t tell. Am I overthinking the things she’s done wrong? Have they all been reactions to me and my issues. They all call me a loser and make fun of me and laugh. I literally am mean to them so I get it. They all say I repeat my parents msitakes and that it’s embarrassing to call them abusive.  I was angrier tonight than normal and rambled for an hour abt how unfair my parents are bc I drank alcohol on top of my adhd medication which isn’t a good idea. I’m just so annoyed. I don’t get it. Everyone online says my moms sounds like she has mental health issues but my family acts like I’m crazy and mean. The thing is I am mean to them. I remember rambling mean things to my mom as a kid under my breath. They always pick on me and bully me and others and it’s so annoying. I just can’t stand them anymore. Once I realized they were abusive.. I just feel like everything they do makes me mad bc im so sickened by them. I think my moms gotten narcissistic rage bc when I calmly explained how I’d grown as a person and asked for an apology she went INSANE spewing insults at me and was talking in a creepy voice. She reacts calmly when I’m upset tho and I feel like I was mad in a different way than she is. Like I’m so mad I just need to let it out. I just get confused bc I can’t contain anger towards them anymore. My brother yelled and swore at me for stepping in his room to pet his cat .. he didn’t yell he was just talking cruel and said it’s not my cat to pet which I get but I legit just wanted to pet the cat. And that set me off to start attacking him and my family. But it’s like I feel like they deserve it. Ik it’s wrong and will never result in my parents changing or helping anyone and verbal abuse is never ok no matter what but I pretty much just sit their saying all the mean things they do to me.

I was just wondering if it's hard to explain Narcissistic Rage in vivid detail for anyone else. 

Personally, I think the way I rage (suffer) is extremely hard to describe and I indeed find it hard to articulate. It happened to me one week ago. 

* It lasted for about 4 days. I could not calm down for 4 days. I was thinking about the source of the injury for about 5+ hrs per day, could be 10. 
* All the time I kept thinking to myself: *this is irrational, out of proportion anger. Continuing to ruminate on this is not productive and I should have had enough 5 hours ago, yet I still can't stop raging, looks like I won't be able to fall asleep.* 
* Tons of weed do not help. Weed makes me fantasize more...
* ...and I have fantasies of aggression. Like, fantasies of power plays, ruining somebody in my workplace, uniting people against someone, physical destruction... But mostly, fantasies about ""what I could've said better. How else I could've won the argument"". It's not like I didn't win the recent argument. I just had to win it 50 more times in my mind...
* ...and re-living the events in the form of fantasies means that I am constantly in the argument, thus the conflict is not over, rage is prolonged...
* I also often wonder ""wtf am I feeling right now"". ""Is it anger? Am I sad? Am I anxious? wtf exactly is this?""
* I am trying to identify my feelings and emotions so that I can navigate them, but I fail to do so. They are strong as hell, but they are hard to understand. ""I think it's anger. But wait, if it was anger, I would feel it in my body more... it seems to be going in my mind only... is it grief? Am I grieving? Am I suffering from a loss? Maybe I am envious of something? When was the last time I was envious, how did it feel, is it similar to what I'm experiencing right now?""
* I mean, really, I wish I could know what I feel. 
* Perception of time (sense of time) is slightly off. I've been lying down and thinking for 5 minutes, I look at the clock and am shocked to realize that it was 2 hours.
* ""Why am I so fixated on this? Why do I care so much?""",12

Now he won’t speak to me I’ve tried saying sorry and I would never actually do what I said I just used it to hurt him because he hurt me. 

He said he’s done with me etc and told me to leave him alone , but im in a mess he was important to me and I do love him and pissed off that he’s gone now because I’m possessive over him, I can’t eat and can’t sleep etc I’m going to go on a massive depression

My partner is pretty upset and says she spoke to a professional who told her I was a narcissistic sociopath. Now I know I'm not a sociopath, but I thought the narcissist idea was interesting. But the more I read the more I can pick out specific things about me that don't seem to fit. I'm curious what you folks think?

**Traits consistent with narcissism:**

* Low self-esteem (not as bad as when I was a kid)
* Sensitive to criticism (not universally by any means, often times thing roll right off me)
* Love being praised
* Fantasize about success in multiple domains (health, profession, family). Previously I would have thought this was ambition, but it seems to be on the NPD lists
* I get frustrated when close family does not defer judgment in my area of expertise (I'm a highly specialized professional). This doesn't always happen, sometimes I just smile a nod and think ""let them believe whatever they want"", but sometimes its a fight, which I always regret afterwards.
* I'm pretty good at turning empathy off. It's not that I'm not empathetic, but I think I'm pretty good at convincing my self to turn it off if I want to. Similarly I'm good at cutting people out...not perfect, I still think about them once in a while, but I'm certainly better at it than anyone I know.
* Can come across as conceited, often thinking my thought process is superior. My IQ is pretty high (96-98th percentile) and I do believe that means something in terms of processing power (that's why the field exists), but I do defer often (probably not enough to her though). ***I think this would be my most narcissistic trait.***

**Specific examples of traits (I think?) not consistent with narcissism:**

* I took months/years out of my professional career to help my partner with hers, no questions asked. I tutored her for months, wrote her applications, did her homework etc... no selfish intentions, just though it was good for her, and I know it would come at a huge cost to my professional training.
* All of the big decisions in my life (where to live, what to live in, how to structure my professional schedule), I've chosen based on my partners desire
* I'm the breadwinner, I give my partner 2x larger budget than I give my self (and they often still don't stay within that)
* I will suffer to do what I think is right for the environment. No one knows, and I don't get any benefit out of it (ie: bus when I had the means to drive, even if it means waking up 30 min earlier on an already busy day, minimizing garbage, reusing as much as possible)
* My long-term roommates (4 years) never felt I had any narcissistic traits. I usually volunteered to take the crappy room to make things easier.
* I'm not a jealous person at all. My partner often complains that how non-jealous I am makes her think I don't love her. When she left, there was no rage. It bothered her more than I didn't make a big fuss.
* I'm super loyal. Loyalty is high on my priority list. If you do something for me, I won't forget it.
* I stay away from social media, don't like it. Not interested in getting attention on it.
* I do plenty for others without recognition. For example I've got a sick family member that now needs 24hr care. On the weekends I take over their care to relieve my family. I sleep in their bed (they can't be trusted to get up on their own), change their diaper, wipe their urine off the floor in the middle of the night, and then clean it up so no one knows in the morning.
* Almost every morning, I wake up in a loving mood and bug them for kisses (they don't like kissing before they brush their teeth).

**Edits:**

* I have the means to afford an expensive house, car, clothes, self-care etc....but I don't and I never spend any money on my self or make much effort in my appearances. I used to spend 2hours in the gym per day for 4 years power-lifting just to get stronger. My body never really changed, and I never even considered spending that time to work on bodybuilding or something else that would have made me more attractive.
* I instinctively give her the better side of things, and I don't think of impressing her or winning points by doing it, just seems like the right thing to do. Ie: I will bus to leave her a car. If we're at a restaurant and I get a sense she doesn't like her food, I switch our plates and pretend I like hers. I don't ask her to contribute towards the finances, instead to do whatever she's passionate about (arts).
* When she called me a narcissist I wasn't angry. I was a little sad, but I thought it was a very interesting hypothesis and started researching it right away.

So I think my partner is right, I'm sensitive to criticism, I want to be respected for my achievements, I can come off as conceited, and I'm not always emotional. But those can be traits shared by lots of different people/personalities, no? I don't THINK I do the ""good stuff"" for any sort of recognition, but who knows? I guess if I was a narcissist I would think that about myself? I feel that a lot of specific examples in my life seem to suggest the opposite...I don't feel like I'm 2 different people. Is it possible to often care for, and act purely in the best interest of others, but still be a narcissist?

**Edit 2:** Wow! Thank you guys so much! Wasn't sure I'd get anything. I know I need to ask a therapist, but this conversation is  really appreciated!",10
120,What do y’all think?,Interesting_Cup631,3,rtgzpt,2022-01-01 10:42:34,1,"I’m pretty sure like dead on that I’m suffering from NPD. Im going to try and summarize everything quickly. My dad passed away when I was in kindergarten so everyone always spoiled me and treated me better out of pity I’m guessing. So I always had a big ego as a child but once 6th grade came I burned away because I also had HGD which slowed down my development and puberty so there was a huge gap in development between me and the kids around my age. I was ugly, I had braces, skinny and was short. Everyone basically bullied me. I hated everything about me eventually and 7th grade comes around and my brain made a false ego as a defense mechanism and I felt better than god himself. I was so in “love” with myself. I had a workout routine, I was a huge prick, little to no empathy or sympathy and belittled everyone around me including my family. Anyone who people said were better than me I’d instantly hate and try to become better. I picked up other peoples hobbies like basketball just so I could be better than that at their own game. I would head to the cafeterias bathroom and fix what ever I felt was ugly, liked messed up hair. I’d stay up all night watching YT videos on how to stay fit, have great hair and become more attractive. I was very violent and angry. I would hit anyone if I was losing. It would be like 3 in the morning and I’d sneak into the bathroom to fix my hair so I could sleep feeling attractive. I was very materialistic. In reality I still hated myself but was blinded by the facade. I never realized how much of my life was focused on how other people view me. I was this “prick” from 7th grade to 10th grade. I didn’t become aware up until now, when a friends friend told me about NPD.
Now that I am aware of what is really going on in my head. I honestly feel horrible. I’m am very insecure. My closest friends still think I’m a prick. I sometimes don’t know who my reflection is, I take the best things out of my friends and replicate them. I base my personality off of more interesting people or characters. I hate myself so much but still feel more important than everyone else. I lie about most things. I want to be so different. I have a hard time being empathetic or sympathetic. I spend the entire day thinking about myself and my problems. I’d rather be the one talking especially if it’s about myself. I hate the fact there are others like me. I am very selfish. Most of my friendships have always been pretty superficial hence the fact I don’t have many friends. Does this sound like NPD?",3

123,My psychiatrist said my ex is a narcissist? Was it inappropriate?,salemaugustine,4,qwxrkn,2021-11-18 19:40:26,11,"So, I was at an ADHD center getting testing done 2 days ago. I am in basically the most difficult time of my 25.9 years on this planet. Way passed due for therapy, and seeing a doctor about my neurological issues. In my excitement for finally getting my mental health right, I really confided in my psychiatrist. She was very nice, and also had ADHD and sensory processing sensitivity (my diagnosis I got that day). 

I very briefly shared my current relationship situation. Maybe 5-10 minutes. She said with much conviction that he is a narcissist, and said it’s not good for me to still live with him. 

My initial (internal) response was that it didn’t seem right, or accurate to assess someone so fast who wasn’t there. I also am admittedly defensive of him and have a fear of messing up the image of him in other peoples minds, being too biased. Partly, because he’s so against talking to other people about our relationship, and says they’ll just take my side and make me hate him. 

He definitely has major issues. Lots of trauma from childhood, abandonment issues, sexual abuse from his last boyfriend before me, body dysphoria, depression and OCD. But I also credited him for being deeply compassionate and giving. He basically would buy me anything I need or want. He is very sentimental with gifts and holidays. Early on was very romantic. Thoughtful in many ways, and has a complex about being taken advantage of. 

But the lack of sex was always a problem. He refused to see a therapist for it. Then over time he became less affectionate altogether, treating me almost like a little brother he’d pick on/annoy. Everything was a joke. And we’d had some nasty arguments where he’d twist my words, take advantage of my bad memory (ADHD) and rewrite history. All while accusing me of being manipulative and crazy or like his abusive ex. He’d also have depressed episodes where he’d basically sleep all day. But then he’d have moments of extreme kindness, being a good listener, seeming really worried about me and my mental health. 

I assumed it was his depression. He is very self depreciating, saying often (sort of jokingly) I’ll leave him because I’m too good for him. Eventually those were the only sort of compliments he’d even give me. Ones at his expense. 

After 3+ years, and 2 days after signing a lease he broke up with me. He seemed super happy, normal and okay about it, while I was falling apart. He took me to Vegas, had sex with me, bought me stuff. But still insisted we’re just better off friends. I couldn’t understand how he was so okay, despite being scared I’d leave him for years. 

Yet we still sleep in the same bed, he takes me to his family functions, and he got upset when I said I might move out early. 

This entire relationship has been a mind fuck. And I’m still super protective of him, because I thought that charming, selfless, romantic gentleman I met would come back. Yet he blames me for most of his depression and why he’s gotten worse. 

I know we both have issues, but is it really possible he could be a narcissist? I’m terrified at the possibility because it’d mean I don’t even know him and everything I loved was a lie.",4
124,Sound like NPD?,FrOCD1998,1,p3xj39,2021-08-14 00:11:57,8,"So basically I’ve been thinking I have NPD, it lines up very well with complaints everyone in my life has made and I believe it to be true. I also am 100% diagnosed with ocd, but I still struggle. Essentially when my gf and I started dating, she was a dick to me out of her trauma (just snappy and rude) and I sought out someone else from my past and essentially emotionally cheated (this was 2 years ago) and if you asked the girl today she’d say it was nothing even close to anything more than friendly conversation. But anyways, this led down a long path of thinking I was in love with said girl and that she would do better in all the roles my gf wasnt etc. eventually we chalked it up to real relationship issues and worked through them, the biggest one for me was snapping and being rude. She also may have BPD btw. 

Anyways I know she’s a great girl and today in the car, she was telling me something and I said “wait what?” And she got very frustrated because she thought I wasn’t paying attention and ignoring her on purpose. This is from an insecurity of being unheard and she voiced this, then voiced that saying “can you repeat that I didn’t hear you” would be better all while very frustrated. She even opened up about how it made her feel, still very frustrated, but she NEVER used to do that so it went well. This is also the only time in a while this has been an issue. But, I then said “well I do something’s like that too as a defense for feeling a threat, see how that’s the same” and this annoyed her because again I’m turning it onto me like “hey well I struggle with that too” as opposed to just sitting there and letting her vent and letting it go. 

She was upset and for awhile and we were on our way to get a dresser for our apartment and I tried talking to her about other stuff but she was so focused on getting us to get the dresser that she didn’t respond, I got angrier and like shit came back about “oh old crush wouldn’t do this” and it infuriated me. I literally didn’t think about that shit for a year and it’s back cause she slipped up from what seems to be understandable. It sucks and I’m angry and feel the need to tell her cause she said if it came into my head again to let her know so she could leave me. Goddamn I feel like shit please help.",1

I’m angry that there is still so much work ahead of me. I am fucking angry about not being able to perceive people properly. I love them when they like me, I hate them when they don’t show affection and at the end of the day I never truly care for anyone. Being this way hurts. I don’t fucking know what caused me to be like this. What did my parents do? They tried their best. I feel like I’m playing the victim all the fucking time and I am, but why am I fucked up then? I wasn’t born this way.

Why do I hate myself so much? Why do I need attention so desperately from others that it takes over my entire world? Why do I feel like I’m such a bad person?

I'm not asking for a diagnosis, but feel free to say whatever you want. If you wanna spit some big psychological words at me I don't mind, who knows. Maybe it will help. Maybe it will put things into perspective for me. That's what I want. I just need somewhere to openly analyze myself that isn't r/therapy or something cause everybody there seems like a bit of a hack. I wanna figure myself out and I want to know how to deal with myself. Be a different person.

 I wrote something earlier when I was feeling a little upset, a bit more close to myself. I'll just paste it below:

&#x200B;

When someone laughs at something I said or I accidentally say something someone found funny I immediately freeze up and go into a silent daze. In my head I'm strategizing how I can keep this up, how I can keep this person laughing/interested in me. I don't know why I do this, I don't know how to just be a genuine person. I try to pick and choose everything I say or do meticulously depending on the people I'm with. I constantly think about fake situations, I'm always living in the invisible future instead of being in the moment. I try to plan my future, I try to plan everything that will happen to me and how I will react to it. Of course, that means I'm constantly setting myself up for disappointment. But no matter what I do I can't stop doing it. I don't know where I am. I don't know who I am. As far as I know, I have the brain of an insect. A sad little terrified insect and I am unable to help myself. Sometimes I fantasize about some horrible head trauma happening to me, or some kind of lobotomy, that zaps me back into shape. Suddenly I think normally. I'm like everyone else. I comfortably say what's on my mind while still holding my tongue when I need to. I don't think as much. I'm not living in my own head constantly. My head doesn't feel miles away from my own mouth. 

&#x200B;

128,How do I apologize?,Prestigious-Box-3001,14,p8sn3h,2021-08-21 14:42:17,28,"So, I'm not diagnosed, but I have some traits of covert narcissism. 

A while ago, I discarded a friend after name-calling him and being emotionally abusive to him. I apologized months later. He came back, we made amends. I was happy. Then it happened again. I insulted him again. What made me finally realize I was being abusive was that after the incident I told him ""How did we get so toxic? It wasn't my intention to get to this point"". Like what the fuck, it was my entire fault. Why am I blame-shifting? 

So, anyways, this has happened too many times. But, he's still there. Hasn't deleted me from his fb page or Instagram, hasn't blocked me. I can't get why. 

What do I do now? I can apologize but it won't matter because it might happen again. Should I encourage him to leave me? If so, how do I go about it? 

Thanks for the attention.",14
129,How can I believe so highly of myself and have such low self esteem?,Street-Extension5823,24,qi4ya9,2021-10-29 04:47:15,12,"Am not sure if this is a narcissist trait but I don't know how to identify these feelings. Maybe it's a way to protect myself to show me some love, I guess?

I feel very angry with myself for wasting my potentials. I see people online, I read stories on reddit and I get furious with me because I believe that I don't deserve to be here and feel this way. My thought goes like: ""How you accept from yourself to waste your time here with all these people who are maybe more mentally sick than you? You have so many talents and you sit all day trying to find someone to listen to you online? You expect people who clearly are failures to help you? And how you accept people in real life who are completely dumb and they don't have the 1/3 of your knowledges and your virtues be ahead of you? You are a person with values, who knows how to treat people, who don't lack social skills while others are animals and you are still afraid? "". I get also very trigerred and angry when people in other subs think that ""we"" who have a certain mental health problem we are mentally retarted, seriously I get very offended and usually I can't identify with this victim mentality .

But on the other side I'm so social anxious and afraid of people that I can't even do basic stuff. I say that I believe in my own abilities and I'm better from others but all the time I get affected from others opinions. I always try to make myself as others want and all the time I wonder if I'm the wrong one. I hear people ditching other people who do some shitty stuff and I get angry because I see the hypocrisy, because I was always the good kid and I never move forward. I see comments on social media how people who have the traits I have are rare and usually people who are like this become successful and I get mad because is not true,because people don't want humans who are like me. It's a lie.

I'm confused whether all these gradiosity feelings comes from narcissism or as a defence mechanism to protect me. But I can recognize that I have failed. I know that nobody owns me nothing. I'm mad with me for letting this happen although I know is the result of the invalidation I get all my life. I know that I'm better and I deserved something better but I also know that I didn't chase it and I'm mad with it.

I can't identify myself as a covert narcissist because is not that I try to make others say something good for me or I try to manipulate in a passive way. I expect them to give me credits but at the same time I'm mad with me for expecting them to be these people while I'm not to myself.

I feel like I'm the narcissist to myself. It's like I have a voice inside who says to mem: ""I'm so dissapointed with you. How low have you fell? You share your problems online and you humiliate yourself like that?"". And from the other side I look down to people who don't face any struggle and I think that I can't make any discussion with them because they are so oblivious to understand. But when they talk to me I crave their acceptance so hard and I give them so much importance.

People who know me say that I'm very harsh with my self and too proud. And when someone says that I should calm down and that other people are in my situation, that other people are 27 and maybe still don't have a job, I get mad and usually say that I don't care about what others do, I did the most effort from all and I don't deserve to be in this position. But at the same time I try desperately to find someone who may struggled the way I did and sometimes it's comforting to know that you are not the only one who are in this situation.

When people suggest me to take medication or go to therapy I feel that they invalidate and they think of me too low to believe that I'm so weak to accept these solutions. But in the past I followed whatever therapists said to me and whatever medication they suggested and I got worse so there is a reason I look so down on them.

Maybe I'm not narcissist maybe I just try to practice self love in a very unhealthy way. I'm confused because a narcissist is, supposed to be someone who takes at least care of himself at least psysically not someone who berates himself as me. From the other side, I think that I'm an incredibly intelligent person with many talents but no without a proof, I don't believe that I'm good at something I'm not. But I think I'm pretty when all my life people think I'm ugly so I'm not sure. Deep inside I really believe that I like me the way I'm, I always see myself as the main character, the protagonist, even when I read books and movies I identify with the traits the main character has and I don't believe that anyone else have them but at the same time I feel that I'm ridiculous, I don't have the right to think of me so highly and since nobody sees it how could I feel this way?",24
130,Could I have been misdiagnosed?,unknowngrrrrrrl,12,np8gqy,2021-05-31 17:19:57,10," 

I got the diagnosis of major depression at the age of 13. From then on I was the girl who must have low self esteem, who felt pressure to cut herself and who apparently wanted to die.

Let me start at my childhood. I was born in a somewhat wealthy family. When I was 2 my younger sister was born. I didn't like that. Growing up I would often hit her and intimidated her. One time I pooped in her bed and she got blamed for it. She was scared of me especially of my anger outbursts. Besides that we've played together a lot. In kindergarten I remember eating a piece of a birthday cake that was reserved for someone else. Of course I didn't admit to it but a different kid did even though he had nothing to do with it whatsoever. I like I wasn't blamed. However I often had stomach pain before going to kindergarten each day and often did not want to go. My mother says it was due to being anxious. In primary school I remember crying one time while giving a presentation.

My parents decided to get pets. So we had a dog who I loved. Despite that I would often beat her. I guess I took agression my father gave me out on her. He was prone to outbursts, shouting and slapping me. My mother did not like that but ended up denying it when I told the psyadric staff years later. Meanwhile my parents had a failing marriage. We also had two guinea pigs. I remember putting both of them into a tiny suitcase and throwing them down the stairs when I randomly got very angry. Upon impact the suitcases opened and the two of them were fine. You could say I abused my pets I would say. On the topic of that, I killed a pet snake after she escaped because I couldn't find her anymore and simply refused her water. I also got rats which I later released in the wild because my family was not happy with them. I don't regret what I did. In fact I have not felt guilt in my life ever. This is the main reason I believe I don't fit the criteria for depression. I don't think people know about this anyway so that could explain why I got depression and not something else. I think I got put into a box without looking deeper into my mind.

In fifth class I was more of a loner. My grades were okay but got worse over time. I then had to repeat seventh grade. I had a small circle of friends.

One day I remember a classmate opening a pencil sharpener and talking to other people how they could be hurtful to someone. That day I went home, opened mine and drew about four thin cuts on my arms. This lead to what I believe was more of an addiction. I had to hurt myself to feel better. By the way, I was never asked why I started it. People kept talking about some pressure which had to be released which apparently I did through cutting. I don't remember there being such a pressure. I just did it sometimes. Then my parents took me to a psychriatic hospital and I was interviewed.

So I got diagnosed with depression because:

\- I felt little emotion. Like a cloud was over them. Now (at the age of 22) I feel neutral most of the time.

\- I'd hurt myself

\- I did feel sad and cried often during my following teenage years. I also continued cutting myself.

\- My selfharm and frequent crying (main reason someone gets diagnosed with depression) just stopped apruptly. But I never received the therapy a person with depression and selfharm would need.

Another thing that surprises me that I had no problem with dressing heavily in alternative clothing, hairstyles and make up, I was also anxious and got a diagnosis for social anxiety. If people with anxiety care so much about how others view them, why would I dress in a way that says ""weirdo"" to begin with? At one point I got diagnosed with psychotic depression but that seems like a weak explanation at best.

The reason people believe I was depressed was that a lot of things happened at the same time. My parents split up, my beloved dog died (I never said goodbye or anything) and my ex was a douchebag. However this explanation does not resonate with me much and I just roll with it and the image of the struggling depressed kid who is now recovered.

I went through an emotionally abusive relationship during middle school. After about 9 months I was out of it and me and my best friend at the time both agreed he was a psychopath based on evidence but that is not relevant now.

Funnily enough though, one therapist I saw I showed potential signs of developing a personality disorder. The three ones that stood out mostly were schizoid, narcissistic and maybe antisocial and borderline. I now have the diagnosis that basically says you will sure have one in the future (my father is borderline). Still I have the diagnosis of depression and this other thing that is a lighter version of depression (can't remember the name).

I could ""become"" schizo according to her because I don't go out often even though I now have a boyfriend and we see each other frequently. He is an ideal marriage partner. I also would like to make friends however the ones I make are temporary and I am not regarded as a friend back? I have though about the possibilities of having autism as well, but I don't match the criteria in other aspects.

Realizing this made me remember I am surely going to have a personality disorder however it seems that looking over the diagnostic criteria of the ones I've mentioned don't seem to fit someone who was depressed. And I am certainly I am not depressed now.

Keep in mind I don't fit the criteria for any of the personality disorders mentioned (yet =)). I also don't think I ever fitted the diagnostic criteria for depression to begin with.

According to psymed this is a list of some criteria for a diagnosis and my experiences with them:

* Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day. (Not true now, but mostly true then.)
* Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day. (Low yes, but not ""diminished"")
* Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day. (Never true)
* A slowing down of thought and a reduction of physical movement (observable by others, not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down). (Never true)
* Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day. (Sometimes true then and now)
* Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt nearly every day. (I did feel worthless in the past sometimes. Not true today at all. Also I have never experienced guilt in my life, ever.)
* Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day. (Never true)
* Recurrent thoughts of death, recurrent sudicidal imagination without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide. (Never true. However I once told my abusive ex I tried to kill myself so he would care about me. That did not work as I later realized he never cared anyway)

I can see this is a lot for some of you to go through and I am looking forward to your feedback! Thank you to those who read all. Please let me know what you think. Who would know better than you?",12

And everyone's like"" oh you're just in your head"" no I'm fucking not cause look I was right again. I basically never act on it other than asking if something is wrong. Cause ya know I don't wanna risk looking crazy.

Or you're in a group of people and someone is acting off and they leave or something. I'm like what's wrong with them? Everyone else is like ""they're fine they just had to leave."" but then I text them (cause I'm worried it had to do with me) and yeah, they're upset over their dead dog or some shit.

133,"Advice for vulnerable narc breakups or ""going our separate ways"" (bpd included)",MDD678,8,pbkew8,2021-08-25 21:04:33,1,"Hi all, bpd/VN traits. This post is me asking for coping mechanisms, ig what doesn't kill you makes you stronger but still, I have to face the facts I am emotionally fragile at time, and emotionally reactive to certain situations which threaten my self-esteem, or cause some sort of like... ""loss"" in me or something. I have briefly opened up to my ex about this (I think she knew I had 'issues' and she dated another guy who also had the same 'issues' too), and friends, they said basically seek professional help however VN is obscure and from what is read, there isn't much help for borderlines or VNs. I could possibly at some point do that but in the mean time....

I have always felt kinda upset or angry with being ignored, with having slighting remarks thrown at me, my feeling getting hurt, triggering people and things of that nature. This however is a bit of a new ball game,

OK:

VN here, this irks upon the abandonment side of VN. In future relationships I am interested in hearing about the best way to tolerate separation from another, like for instance if a new partner were to say ""I am not happy in this relationship I am leaving you"" (fear of loss), or even worse ""instant breakup"". With my ex, I basically started acting out (not rage) when she moved on. I felt crushed, and part of the problem was getting too wrangled into her. Getting borderline-eske emotional and acting out after every end of a story isn't the greatest way, but I suppose for VN this is how it intrinsically is. Some of this is overthinking, but there will no doubt be a time when this will become real and I need the coping mechanisms (which I lacked with my now-ex) to cope with this in the future.

I can't even find much online about help with this, ig targeting the cause this my own time (like the underlying reasons behind abonnement problems, but despite all that I have read I am unsure about where to begin. A friend said it probably wasn't even worth the headspace.

There were just multiple times during the relationship where I'd be looking online for reasons why this was the case, like I vaguely recall something along the lines of ""triggers inner shame upon abandonment"" or something of the sort. Seems like most online resources on this focus more on the side of abuse not the fragility of the ego itself. Why though would the loss of the relationship trigger shame or panic (it is also related to the ""discouraged borderline"" description which I relate to vaguely, but only when with something. Yeah basically I need coping mechanisms or ways around that.",8
134,Romance Rant,AnasuiBalls69,13,qh8u7z,2021-10-27 22:54:32,16,"I'm a diagnosed narcissist with autism and ASPD. I always tell my partners about the autism and ASPD, as my low empathy, and antisocial behaviors can manifest in different ways. I tell them about the narcissism once the relationship is serious (as it has ties to deeper trauma) and warn them that I can act out and not to put their own safety at risk, as I can be extremely sneaky and manipulative. They always agree, and even say that they love me, with my disorders included.

The amount of girlfriends who think that they are the exception to my low empathy is insane. I literally cannot help the way I feel (or don't feel), I can't feel sad over the same things they feel sad about. My past girlfriends would be sad over something, and while I don't like seeing them cry, I won't cry over it with them. I don't really cuddle unless they initiate it first, even if I know they're sad. They honestly expect to be the partner who changes me from a cold and emotionally distant person into a teddy bear. I will never be the loving partner that they dream of. I always tell them this, and they always try to be the one who changes me. 

I get angry easily. I hate having my perfection challenged. I lashed out at partners before for this. I hate when they try to guilt trip me, so I guilt trip them back, harder. Some girls, specifically self proclaimed empaths, want to be more of a therapist than a partner. They claim to know what I'm ""really"" like, that I'm just a scared little girl, that I really am not a narcissist, I just have confidence, but none of that is true. They'll do everything to try and change me, but any narcissist knows that nobody can ""love"" away your issues. 

Speaking of love, I will always love myself more than them, it's just a fact. When they leave, I have myself, so of course I put my needs over theirs. If they ask me ""would you leave me if it gets too hard?"" I have to fight back saying 'Yes, I would leave if it gets to hard.' because it would break their heart and make them leave. Even though I tell them that my love is conditional, they still try to be the exception. I will never love somebody if it doesn't benefit me somehow. So when I leave once they stop giving me the thing that I stayed for, they act like this was a shocking turn of events that nobody saw coming. 


TLDR: I hate people who willingly date narcissists and think they they're the exception to our symptoms.",13
135,I need a coping mechanism other than just getting high for when my ego is punching me in the face,hellohellscape,7,r62zbg,2021-12-01 01:29:09,3,"My ego is so out of whack, when I'm hanging out with my girlfriend while she's talking with friends I feel so fucking anxious. I start getting weird daydreams where I walk in on her cheating on me, I over-analyze everything right down to her laugh, I feel hurt if she calls someone else a nickname that she usually calls me. 

I don't want to feel this way. I just get a tight feeling in my chest like somethings wrong. And then my self esteem drops.

I put on a happy face, laugh with her friends, tell her I'm so happy she found a group that she likes being in. And it's true, I do like that she has a friend group. I'm just struggling with my own unstable ego.

When I get high, my feelings can get hurt pretty easily. So it's easier to shrug things off like ""oh I just feel bad bc I'm high, it's probably nothing"". But it's not good to get high every time she hangs with friends. Maybe I could try ""oh I just feel bad bc I'm a narc, it's probably nothing"" lol 

I'm trying to approach of trying to become comfortable with not having control. I don't say much if I feel like a friend crossed a boundary (bc I understand that my boundaries are far too strict and unattainable), I resist the urge to take up her attention, I even act friendly to her friends despite feeling incredibly threatened by them.

I guess in the end, as long as she's happy then I'm happy. And I mean that genuinely. But I should still take care of my mental health, for her sake and mine.

I've already told her my feelings of jealousy. She was so understanding. I was honestly expecting her to be upset with me when I told her how insecure I was, but she really did just hold me while I sat there like the broken man I was - sobbing over something so stupid and small. She was more concerned that I didn't feel comfortable telling her sooner. She's great, she honestly deserves the best of friends she can get. Now that I've told her, I need to do my part and actually try to resist the jealousy.

Okay even after typing this out, I'm feeling a little better.

**TL;DR:** if anyone has some coping mechanisms and distractions for when my ego is making me act like a little bitch, that would be great! I'd appreciate it a lot. Coping mechanisms surrounding ACT (acceptance & comittment therapy) seem to help a little bit for me.",7

However, every time I lose a game, my self-esteem suffers and I end up feeling angry at myself or just sad and empty. It's always this cycle of victory and grandiosity, and defeat and deflation.

138,"To Have NPD, You Have to Meet Criteria for Having a Personality Disorder",ImperiousAnarchist,30,qfh7l1,2021-10-25 13:51:45,11,"As the DSM-5 says, you have to meet the following criteria first before you can even consider yourself to have NPD. I see a lot of people coming here with traits of a narcissist but not an actual personality disorder. This list should provide guidance. 

The following criteria must all be met:

&#x200B;

* An enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of the individual's culture. This pattern is manifested in two (or more) of the following areas:
   * Cognition (i.e., ways of perceiving and interpreting self, other people, and events).
   * Affectivity (i.e., the range, intensity, lability, and appropriateness of emotional response).
   * Interpersonal functioning.
   * Impulse control.
* The enduring pattern is inflexible and pervasive across a broad range of personal and social situations.
* The enduring pattern leads to clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
* The pattern is stable and of long duration, and its onset can be traced back at least to adolescence or early adulthood.
* The enduring pattern is not better explained as a manifestation or consequence of another mental disorder.
* The enduring pattern is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition (e.g., head trauma).

The fifth criterion will explain some people's issues here. I see a lot of people with OCD, anxiety, depression, and so on come here asking if they're a covert narcissist. Most likely the five other mental illnesses you have will explain your behavior and thought patterns.

The first criterion is also key. For example, I see myself as an enlightened being too noble for this world and too superior for the ignorant masses that surround me. Anything bad I do? That's just the fault of the society around me that twisted my mind. Anything good I do? The enlightened being that is I takes full responsibility. None of that line of thought is rational or normal for US or Colombian culture. 

Okay, so you think you're better than others. So what? Maybe you are. A lot of people around here are quite intelligent. These folk are bound to be more intelligent than others. That's not abnormal to think, especially if you live in a Western culture; ESPECIALLY if you live in the US. But if you start viewing yourself as a semi-divine being on the path to nirvana making you untouchable to all criticism, then boy go see a psychiatrist. 

The third criterion is also relevant. The pattern of behavior and thought HAS to lead to SIGNIFICANT psychic distress or impairment. Now, this disturbance doesn't have to manifest in the extreme. The distress could be as simple as getting upset you lost at a competitive game like chess because you expect yourself to be so smart as to always win. The impairment could be as cotidian as you ignoring a friend for a few weeks becaue you envy an award they got at a ceremony and all the attention they got. However, these distressful episodes and impairments have to build up significantly to the point that your life is affected enough that a psychiatrist or a psychotherapist will say ""damn bruh, you got personality issues.""

That's all for now. Clear your mind of turmoil and have a serene day.",30
139,I think I have NPD along with my BPD,krakenrabiess,7,qqk5b8,2021-11-10 02:43:13,10,29F. Been in therapy majority of my life. It's something I never brought up during therapy because I think I've improved ALOT since I was a teenager but I love pissing people off and making them feel bad and it makes me feel good but then I feel bad like ....REAL bad. It's the main reason I don't have friends. I'm blunt. I lack empathy if it's not something I can relate to and chances are even if I relate I'll talk about it as if I'm better and unaffected. I cry all the time about being alone but I'm the reason I'm alone and I try to change things about myself but then I stop caring because I don't see a point. I'm either too emotional or emotionless and it feels like I'm being torn apart. Sometimes it feels as if I have an entirely different side of myself that takes over and likes causing people pain but then there's this other side that hates myself because I don't want to be like this and the cycle just keeps repeating.

141,Curious about NPD,boofmeth,11,ii5jh9,2020-08-28 11:43:48,6,"In recent days I’ve been entertaining the idea that I could have NPD. I’ve not been diagnosed with anything other than ADHD and GAD, and I’ve also only seen my GP and one psychiatrist. I take antidepressants and stimulants, but I’ve have a hard time telling if the antidepressants are working because I have a habit of abusing my stim meds and using alcohol nearly every day. So, to keep this reasonably short, because for reasons that are unknown to me I fear being rejected on reddit for making long unintelligible ramblings. My main concerns are these:

I am in a committed relationship, in which I do feel bored but I also feel that this boredom I feel would occur eventually, no matter who I’m with. That being said, I do truly care about my partner and I believe she’s a very good and sincere person - I just feel this undeniable boredom which I cannot seem to make sense of. It borders on apathy when it comes to how she feels, I sometimes upset her or try to make her concerned for no real reason. I don’t understand why I do it. I often feel angry at myself for it, and regret it, but I have enough insight to understand that it’s a very immature sense of anger and regret and it does not motivate any change, as I have not changed. 

I have constant fantasies and daydreams about power, fame, and being special in some widely recognized way. In my mind, sometimes I’m a movie star, a musician, a game designer, or some well-respected creative type in a niche that no one understands but me. Someone who all the people in my life who never understood me as I am can finally see. As well as this though, I often fantasize about people who victimized me in elementary and high school beating the shit out of me, or humiliating me in some awful way. These fantasies are not remotely pleasurable, it’s more like some twisted rumination but fantasy/daydreams is the best word I have to describe it. Fantasies about power and fame are far more often, but unfortunately for me these grotesque daydreams happen to me too, they can come at any time. 

I really feel that I am special in some way that I can’t yet define, not important, at least not yet, but that somehow in some way my true uniqueness will shine and everyone alive will bask in my greatness. I don’t know where it came from, but I have this notion that I’m a uniquely creative person and that if I just tried harder I could really make some significant change in the world and in the lives of everyone around me. I also know that this is likely not true, and that I am a nobody and will remain that way for all of my life, but some primitive reptilian part of my brain always insists that I am fucking amazing and if I try harder I can become whatever I want to be. 

I want to think that I feel empathy for other people, but I’m not always sure if I do. I try desperately to care for my partner as much as she makes it seem like she cares for me, but I have trouble doing so. She thinks I’m a kind, generous, and good person. I have a great deal of trouble accepting this, and I haven’t, but I put on a mask because she becomes sad when I deny that these traits are in me. 

This post is becoming long, so I’ll leave my main concerns as is. I fear that people will refuse to read, or give me any credit for expressing myself if my post is too long and wordy. I’m not extremely confident in my writing skills. I haven’t used reddit in a while - I deleted it along with other social media’s a while back.

So obviously I can’t ask any of you lot to diagnose me, but can anybody in this sub relate to what I’ve written, or had relatable experiences?",11
142,Random thoughts and questions,BOWDOWNBXTCH,6,r3lvlu,2021-11-27 20:15:14,3,"What are your relationships like? Have they always been affected by your narcissistic traits? Not even just romantic relationships but any kind. 

I’ve always had a heightened sense of self importance and entitlement so I don’t really care about the others needs. I want my needs to be met and if the person doesn’t do what I want or say I get angry and despise them. I want to hurt them because they should be punished for not obeying me and seeing me as superior. I always notice how I don’t care about people, just what they do for me.

Also I have always manipulated people. It just happens naturally like I’ll meet someone and instantly think of what I want from them and how I’m going to get it. Sometimes it’s just for amusement because I’m always bored or maybe I’ll have a plan to do something just to say I can. Like making someone fall in love with me because why wouldn’t they? I can make people do anything I want or believe whatever I want them to believe. 

Also, do you ever just look at yourself and be like “damn I’m fucking perfect.” Or sexy? I can look at the most random body part and start thinking about how sexy it looks and everyone should think the same. And I have to be seen as perfect and the best at everything. Mostly for me it’s my intelligence but also being the funniest or whatever really. I just have to be the best at everything or I am not satisfied. 

Do you ever have the complete opposite of those thoughts? I either think I am a goddess and everyone is an object to me and should praise me forever the greatness I am or I feel like I am nothing and a failure and it hurts so bad. Like currently I am depressed because I am not getting the narcissistic fuel I need. I am 22 and still not the person I always dreamed of being but yet I’m still here because I have always felt I had a higher purpose. 

What about dark violent thoughts of harming others? I’ve always had a tendency of harming people, mostly emotionally or mentally, but seeing people in pain or embarrassed etc makes me feel so satisfied and entertained. And sometimes I have thoughts of violence towards people especially when they don’t obey me and my wants. I’m not sure if this is the urge for power and control or if it’s something else entirely.",6

144,Would you consider this covert narcissism?,nottoosuretbhbruh,8,nssgiz,2021-06-05 10:03:08,6,"I don't know if I'm a covert narcissist or have tendencies but here's why I think I might.

**Reasons why I think I'm a cover narcissist:**

(1) I have tons of power fantasies. The responsibility of power in real life is burdensome though so it stops at fantasies only.

(2) People who gets sick or become needy feel like a burden to me. I'll help but I'll be salty that there's no exchange. I'll build resentment towards them (but I'd still help them with the bare minimum).

(3) I prefer empaths for friendships/relationships because I get more bang for my buck.

(4) All my interactions feel transactional. Including with family. I do little things here or there with family just so that it doesn't feel that way but putting 100% of my effort for someone else in a moment of altruism when it isn't to repay back a favor is hard for me.

(5) My way of dealing with someone pissing me off is being passive aggressive or outright ignoring them.

(6) If someone attacks my ego, or someone I think I'm better than does better than me, I get REALLY salty. I'll keep it to myself and fume over it when I'm alone but I won't do anything direct about it. I'll just work to be better than them or go for a run.

(7) If someone I was close to for a long time pisses me off beyond a certain point or become a burden, I don't text them or anything. I just ghost and block them without saying anything.

(8) I can't nurture deep friendships. Almost all of my friendships are the product of transactions that fizzle out.

(9) I'm rarely ever emotionally available. I rarely actively reach out to a friend unless they keep hitting me up because I'm lost in my own world. The only exception is if I want something. In which case, I'll reach out and give them stuff first and hang out a few times so they don't feel like I only hit them up when I want something.

(11) I don't give with expectations but I almost always give with an acknowledgment that it increases my chances of getting what I want (even if it's not guaranteed and I'm not entitled to anything from someone). If the other person doesn't reciprocate much, I don't complain to them. I just cut the person off.

(11) If I could get away with it, I would keep using someone without reciprocating. The reason I don't do it is because if I rely on them too much, they'll have leverage over me and if too much resentment builds, they'll be mad and threaten to leave while having all the power in the dynamic & me needing them to stay afloat.

This is why I prefer empaths because I can still reciprocate but they bring more to the table for less effort. Meaning less leverage and even if they do a bit more, there's less threat of leaving.

(12) When someone I care about passes away, it's not necessarily the loss of them that I care about (other than a bit of nostalgia). The real loss comes from realizing that I can't rely on them for meeting a certain need for me. I remember a close friend in our friend group died and our group met up to reminisce about him and then I said ""damn. we need a replacement"" or some shit like that. I said it without thinking and they all laughed or were shocked and were like ""yo wtf"".

(13) When I was younger, I was told that I ""treat people like NPCs"". A sort of main character syndrome. This is no longer the case though.

(14) I've cheated and talked shit on partners when I was younger but we went on 2 dates and I didn't develop anything deep with them. They were also untrustworthy individually. For the only ""deep"" relationship I had, I felt an obligation by conscience to be loyal though.

(15) If I'm not getting positive feedback from others as a result of my behaviors, I start to internally panic.

(16) I can't imagine my partner having guy friends. I'd say this is more cultural than personality since it's viewed as a taboo in my culture for a woman to be giving any men attention besides in a work setting at a bare minimum level in my religion (before I left it). If you allow that, you're viewed as lesser as a man and it's also viewed as straight up cheating.

I also wouldn't have friends who are women so it wouldn't be one-sided. My partner can go out and all that and I wouldn't text them or ask for their phone. No paranoia shit but I just wouldn't be able to tolerate my partner clubbing, flirting with guys whatsoever, or having guy friends at all. That's my bottom-line and it's non-negotiable.

(17) If I feel like someone is ""lower"" level than me in terms of how society views them, I feel super comfortable and unthreatened around them. If I feel that someone is ""higher"" than me in terms of society, I feel on guard, insecure, and socially anxious.

(18) It took me a long time to recognize the needs of others. I avoid a lot of people now because it feels mostly burdensome to account for those needs.

**Reason why I don't think I'm a covert narcissist:**

(1) I can't take compliments.

(2) I don't think I'm special or important. At all.  I also don't believe I have a ""special group"".

(3) I can usually take accountability for my mistakes and reflect on them.

(4) I have a strong conscience. If I realize that my behaviors hurt someone and were out of pocket, I have to make up for them somehow or I'm buried in guilt. It doesn't matter if I gain anything from it.

(5) I never want to be famous. Unless it's anonymously. In that case, I'd love it. Any hate destroys my ego though.

(6) I don't feel powerful by manipulating someone. Manipulating feels BAD unless it's for payback, out of laziness, or for self-protection reasons. The only exception being if it's people I don't know at all and it's minor influence tactics.

(7) I never shame people or try to gaslight them. I HATE that crap. I NEVER ever attack someone's character, even if I'm FUMING in anger and it's in the middle of a heated argument. This is EVEN IF the other person used a character attack on me. At most, I'll point out their negative actions.

(8) I hate being a burden on others. The caveat is that this a projection of me not liking others being burdens to me. So maybe it's a way of self-protection.

(9) I don't lie about my accomplishments. It makes me feel icky.

(10) I don't force my own standards or values onto others. I value freedom of choice. I HATE pressuring anyone into anything.

(11) I will usually only ever lie to cover up something to benefit the relationship or protect myself. It won't be a lie that's blatant. Usually I'll deflect or engage in a white lie but I HATE lying when I don't have to.

(12) I don't wear anything superficial and I don't care about superficial titles.

(13) I met someone who I think is a REAL covert narcissist who was introverted and had grandiose expectations of wanting to be famous and special. They would speak of themselves as if they were god's gift to humanity. They demanded respect. Not commanded. DEMANDED.

They'd try to gaslight me a lot and push their standards on me. They were also very manipulative and would use shame or character attacks or criticism/sarcasm to get what they want. They also would use double speak and hide meaning in their statements to test me and get reactions out of me. It was weird af. I wouldn't have known had they not told me about it. When I called out suspicious behaviors, they would gaslight and deny while making it clear what they were doing for plausible deniability.

Seeing how prominent their narcissistic traits were and how much they influenced me, I started to wonder if I was as much of a narcissist as I previously thought. I felt unwell around them.

(14) In actual conversation, I try my HARDEST to never be dismissive. Even if someone said something dumb, I'll still try to see where they're coming from and validating their efforts without putting them down or being passive aggressive or sarcastic.",8
145,Concerned about my emotional control,notsure98761,8,kd5668,2020-12-14 19:59:38,0,"
My mom is very manipulative and emotionally abusing so it makes sense that I would have been upset with her but I sometimes wonder if something else was going on with my emotions. I was always very sensitive as a kid. I remember my moms would take me to the Same shopping store I liked every day in elementary school and middle school. I feel like at the time I was very insecure and felt the need to fit in and clothes was one way I did I guess. I’m not sure why my mom took me to these stores every day I really think it’s over- spoiling a kid. She would always talk about how the neighbors were wrong for buying their kid a toy every day yet she did this. The weird thing is I was very demanding about getting clothes. I wasn’t trying to be manipulative and was very young but I would feel genuine panic until I got things in dressing rooms. I would “attack” and be angry at my mom in these dressing rooms in a very panicked way. I even remember being older in highschool and when I was at grocery stores with my mom I’d follow her around and I would just be mumbling mean things and complaining about her under my breath but there was just so much anger and I’d like be whispering these things to her. When she gaslighted me I would attack her (verbally) back. 

Although she was a manipulative, controlling, and absuive mom I can’t help but wonder why I responded like this. I’m diagnosed with adhd and know I have anxiety/ocd/depression now. I can’t help but wonder if this was all a lack of understanding at the time since I didn’t know I had adhd or understand where I was raised- or if I could have some mood disorder",8
146,Is this Narcissism or Narcissistic Fleas?,theautumnalequinox,9,nywkep,2021-06-13 13:40:52,3,"Hello, 

I'm a 30-year-old woman who has been in therapy for over 10 years. Diagnoses vary. But mine include: OCD, C-PTSD, and GAD. I would say, insofar as a attachment styles go, I'm a fearful avoidant (lots of push-pull). For the longest time, I thought I was struggling with co-dependency. I have had some stable partners, but as of last year, was confident I was discarded by a narcissist which set me out to do research. I am well aware I was raised by two narcissists. If you're familiar with Tudor--I'd say my mom is a middle mid-rage, and my dad is lower than her (very Trump-like), so I'm acutely aware of their cycles, and see characteristics in myself including:

Grandiosity

Love bombing (I idealize the shit out of people--but then I keep idealizing them. There's never really a decline. In fact I think I overstay in relationships)

SENSITIVITY TO CRITICISM

Truly, rejection debilitates me. I have thought maybe this was attachment wounds. Because rejection causes physical pain in my body and I can't overcome it. Like I'm unable to work/care for myself/function without the support of others. But then, to counter this, I isolate, because I don't want to be co-dependent, or over-rely on others. Still, I sense a ""using"" pattern when I'm in an anxious spiral. When my OCD kicks in, I reach out to friends for compulsive reassurance. This could be supply, I'm guessing. 

I have the temptation to lie all the time, but I fight it deliberately. I pride myself on honesty. But this could be grandiosity (maybe I've lied to myself as Tudor talks about--the mid-range types). 

When I'm unhealthy I am a total martyr, though I deliberately try not to play the victim (sometimes I fail).  

 I am ruled by shame. RULED. There's not an hour of my day I'm not ruled by shame. 

I, for the most part, feel below other people in power struggles (I've heard this can be a cover thing), but sometimes I feel like I'm ""better"" than other people, and I don't have the energy to care about the homeless man on the side of the road needing spare change. I don't always ""feel bad"" about things I should feel bad about. 

I've prided myself on being an empath because I can always feel and read others. But maybe this is just cognitive empathy? Sometimes I don't care, but I like to hold space for my friends, because I think it's important for it to not always be about me. 

My break-ups on the good end have been civil, but sometimes I've been hateful. I tend to repress my anger til the 11th hour, then tactfully put together letters of ""accountability"" that have angry undertones for my exes because I'm terrible at expressing myself verbally. So it's very much, ""When you did X, I felt Y, I couldn't express it at the time, but this is how I experienced it. I'm not sure if you intended that, but my experience is valid either way."" 

I have trouble distinguishing boundaries, and whose fault is whose, so I tend to take all the blame and stew in shame baths--which could be co-dependent, but I presume it could also be covert. I'm just curious about opinions. I watched some of Kanika Batra's Youtube videos--and tbh, I actually relate to some of the things she said, which concerned me. Namely, that I can't handle rejection. I am FRAGILE. I got rejected by someone I loved with my whole heart last year, and I'm still not over it. Like I'm depressed and I cry...every day. I would have done anything to fix it. I know it's unhealthy...but I'm wondering if it's also narcissism?",9
147,Stop having power struggles with people who have power over you,-TraumaQueen,25,qacivj,2021-10-18 01:37:19,6,"*I've decided to start posting some of the things that I hear in therapy that after being drilled in eventually turn out to be true and solid advice* 

*This will likely be long-winded as I want to try and put down the process of going from brushing ideas off, to fully understanding, accepting, and implementing them. I will try to put a TLDR at the end* 

"" **Stop having power struggles with people who have power over you** "" The first time my therapist said this to me, was about two years ago. The first time I saw the results by actually following this advice, was about 2 months ago. 

I am In general, a very combative person. Especially when it comes to professionals and people of authority. 

When she said this to me, I originally thought something along the lines of ""pfft. *power over me* . That's cute"" because to me, even if someone *legally* or *technically* is assigned some sort of power over me, there's always a way to circumvent that. Always a consequence for trying to enforce power that I won't succumb to. Which leads to them no longer trying to exert that power. 

About 2 years ago I had a CPS case called in. I have a bad habit of pissing people off, and then them calling CPS to retaliate. CPS cases are usually open and shut. This time however, I was in the middle of a divorce, and since both of us have our own cluster B cocktails, there was a lot of drama and pettiness going on, and CPS decided we needed counseling. Which was fine, I made appointments with a therapist I had used in the past and thought it'd be done with from there. 

Unfortunately the caseworker they assigned was someone that I very quickly butted heads with. He was condescending, passive aggressive, and didn't mind exaggerating things to fit his narrative. After our first encounter where I was equally as snarky with him as he was me, he contacted my kids school, daycare, and doctors, and instructed them to call him over any concerns, that nothing was too small, and then frequently called them to ask about the kids. The school would say something like ""xyz had an accident at school today, and we emailed mom because she usually doesn't answer the phone, and then she came to bring him clothes"" and the caseworker would come to our next meeting and say something like "" Mrs. XYZ why do you ignore the school? They have concerns that they cant ever get a hold of you even in emergencies."" So, I would get offended and combative because that's BS, they can always email me, and I respond immediately most times. He frequently asserted that his negative, judgemental assumptions were facts and that I was a liar. So because I felt that my combative attitude was justified, I refused to back down, and so did he. 

The deeper he dug his heels in, the deeper I dug mine. I turned a case that could have been months long into years long. I would refuse to cooperate until just before court, and then I would do everything necessary to be considered compliant, and then the judge would push things out, and I'd do it over again. He'd write up more BS reports, and try to paint the worst possible picture at every chance he got. The last year of the case he wasn't allowed to come to my home without a supervisor present, and in my slightest defense, even the supervisor had to interrupt him multiple times throughout our meetings to say ""hey, try saying it this way instead"" (instead of his usual accusatory, antagonistic way) 

So. The case would go on and on and my therapist would tell him everything was fine and he'd still drag it on, and eventually came a time when I was taken off of a stimulant medication, and had an episode of rage that was worse than my usual rage, that terrified my boyfriend, so he took our son and my daughter and went to his mom's for about a week while I was coming down/withdrawing. The neighbors called the cops to this incident, but I left before they got there, and came home later, and no crime was committed but they reported it to my caseworker. Which really wasn't a big deal because he couldn't do anything about that I hadn't done anything wrong, not anything of his concern at least, but since one of our scheduled meetings was that week and I didn't want to deal with anyone, I told him where the kids and my boyfriend were and to hold the meeting there since I wasn't required to be there. 

So. The caseworker then locates and contacts my oldest child's biological father. This person is a wanted felon. On meth. And a violent criminal. He spent most of her life in prison and hasn't had much to do with her. He however, hates me, and loves to kidnap our daughter whenever he gets the chance. (Which is not often since our court order says he's a danger to her and only has supervised visits). I left him when she was 9 months old because I realized he wouldn't ever stop abusing me or living the fast life. The last time he kidnapped her he terrorized her with Annabelle dolls, took her on robberies, taught her to rob cars, took her with him to stalk women, and beat his gf in front of her. The therapist told this to the caseworker a long time ago. That if my kids were ever removed, he was the last place she should be sent. 

Also, to be clear before this next part, my kids were never removed. They were never placed outside of my home, and there were never any grounds for them to be placed elsewhere. 

He contacts him, and he tells him, the address of our next meeting, knowing I won't be there. He then holds the meeting, and releases my daughter to her biological dad, since my boyfriend has no legal rights over her. He then denies he ever contacted him and said that he just showed up there at the same time as him and had no idea he would be there. What he did was illegal. What he did was petty. What he did, was payback for all of the trouble I had stirred up for him. 

It took about two weeks, 3 police agencies, 2 cps agencies, and 2 days of us sitting outside of biodads house after locating him 3 hours away, before he finally sent her out knowing he had felony warrants and that it wouldn't end well for him. (Police couldn't force entry without solid evidence that he was there) 

And throughout those two weeks my therapist had several sessions with me, and each time the goal was to keep me focused during a time where I was spiraling and my rage towards this caseworker was at its peak. One of the things she said to me that really turned my thoughts around was: 

""Is what he did illegal? Yes. Is what he did screwed up? Yes. Is what he did petty, and against policy? Absolutely. Of course. You know this. I know this. BUT , can you prove it? No. Is he going to get in trouble for it? No. Can you do anything about it? Well. Knowing you, you could probably stir up a whole lot of trouble and a whole lot of drama and keep dragging these things out but for what? He won't care and neither will the agency, and you're wasting all of this energy that needs to be applied to your studying. To school. To your home, your kids, the peace and stability in your home. Who cares about him let him be petty and bitter and bother somebody else home. Get him out of YOUR home. Stop. Having. Power. Struggles. With. People. Who. Have. Power. Over. You. (Probably the tenth time she had said it at that point) Get your kid home, have your next few meetings with him. Yes sir no sir head nod hand shake have a nice day, whatever it takes, be civil, and be done. Because all of this focus on winning. On getting back at him. At being right, and proving this and proving that, it's all drama ,all chaos, all distractions from your goals. Drop it. leave it alone. Some people DO have power over you, and they will abuse it, and even if you retaliate and get back at them, it still took up your time and energy, and still pulled you away from what's important. Whether you ""win"" in the end , or get the upper hand doesn't matter when you think about all of the consequences faced as a result in between. Your daughter is where she is because of YOU. It is YOUR fault and now YOU have to fix this situation, and then back down. Know when to back down. That's more powerful than anything else some of these people can do to you."" 

So I did as she said, and as hard as it was, as much as I wanted to rub it in that I located and brought her home pretty quickly and that he hadn't done much in the long run, as much as I wanted him to suffer for challenging me, I backed down. 2 meetings later the case was closed. As a silver lining I did get several free psychological evaluations, probably as a result of my many 10 mile long lawyerly styled emails accompanied by 80 or so evidentiary attachments to explain to his supervisors why the caseworker was clearly an incompetent asshole. 

Since then, I've wound up in a few situations where I've had that thought play in the back of my mind. ""Don't power struggle with people who have power over you"" and I've backed down (or prevented myself from becoming combative to begin with) and that's led to favorable results each time. The last one being a car wreck where legally the officers could have towed my vehicle and arrested me, but because I was calm and reasonable and the other party was arrogant and combative, they sided with me and let me drive off. The other party was an off duty cop that I rear ended in my boyfriend's insurance-less truck with out of date registration, while having a class B restriction.on my license and no co-passenger. (I'm literally just irresponsible as hell and haven't set up a drive test because there's never been any consequence of driving with my current license despite countless traffic stops and speeding tickets, they've never noticed or cited me for my lack of a legitimate license) The off duty cop was a dick, his vehicle had zero damage, the truck hit his trailer hitch at like 5mph, he got out and demanded I give him my keys (what?) I told him no, he said I was going to want to because - pulls out cop badge- I did not actually care bc an off duty cop is the same as a regular citizen to me, but I knew he was pissed and could probably sway the on duty cops in his favor, so I just waited for them to get there and stayed calm while the off duty cop made an ass of himself. 

Im not sure how helpful just reading this will be to others without experiencing the change it can create, but I'm hoping it might plant a seed in some to try. 

TLDR: Read the paragraph that starts with ""is what he did illegal?""",25
148,I'm NPD and BPD in a Co-Dependent Marriage,Double-Link-1218,9,q8q6rm,2021-10-15 14:58:40,10,"Background: I have a history of mood disorders and disassocation. I was medicated with mood stabilizers for 15 years beginning at nine years old. I was severely bullied from a young age. I didn't have a lot of friends. My parents absolutely hated each other but stayed together ""for the kids"". Never had a relationship with my dad. My mom would not accept my bisexual identity. They hated gay people and most minorities. Told me I'd be kicked out if I ever had sex or got pregnant. They spoiled me, but you could call their upbringing conditional love.

I've been suffering from panic attacks, disassociation, insomnia, intrusive thoughts, and severe mood/personality swings for the last six months ever since I started to realize things about myself and my husband (been together five years now). It started after a huge fight with him. He said some triggering things to me, things that toed the line of manipulation or psychological abuse. ""Your body is my body."" ""Go lay on the bed and get ready for sex or I'm watching porn"". But I said some selfish things and nasty things about him, things considered devaluing.

Our relationship probably didn't start out very healthy. I had a history of sexually pleasing men in high school and college. He was one of them. I didn't really want to have sex but I wanted him to want me. He was so opinionated and funny and outspoken. He cheated on his GF with me. Then we went a while without talking because he started telling people were sleeping together and his girlfriend made him block me on Facebook. I was pissed, but looking back I had NO RIGHT.

So then I dated a terrible guy in the army who manipulated me and abused me, promised me we'd get married, got matching tattoos which I paid for, dumped me over the phone while he was halfway across the country, and later found out he cheated on me and gave me an STD. I decided to run back to my now husband (THAT SAME NIGHT) who had broken up with his girlfriend (she ended up in a mental institution for wanting to kill herself). We built our relationship on sex. He promised me if I could make him finish from XX blowjobs, he would ""put a ring on it"". And I tried so hard to make that happen. After a few months, I found myself feeling more and more uncomfortable during sex. He had a lot of kinks, things like telling me he wanted to ""rape me"" or begging for threesomes. Pushing my head down hard on his dick until I'm choking. He was addicted to porn, watching is for sometimes an hours or more at night, and then comparing me to girls in there. Fraud charges on our credit cards from buying porn. I have found it very hard to enjoy sex. In fact, I kind of dread it.

I'm not broken though, and I'm definitely at fault, too. I've posted many anonymous naked pictures online. I formed an extremely addictive online sexual relationship with a woman (who turned out to be a catfish). I have such a strong desire to be wanted by strangers. Basically, anyone who doesn't love me.

I started therapy after several huge fights with my husband and I started reading the 12 steps books after a lot of marijuana abuse on my end. I realized I was being selfish and not dealing with problems or communicating effectively. This is when I also realized I have a problem with attention-seeking, needing validation, and toxic relationships. My therapist said I sound a little codependent, BPD, and NPD. Our first year of marriage has been HARD. Probably harder than most people's. I just feel like it's either all black or all white. I either love him to death and act like his little ""baby"" and ""wifey"" or I just devalue him and act like he is a monster and an irresponsible idiot and talk trash about him to everyone. It's like I'm a different person around him.

He has ADHD and has destroyed 3 cars in a year and I try to be understanding. However, I find myself thinking less and less of him and reconsidering a future with him. I've built so much contempt, I don't really know if this is the person I want to share my life with. I realize that's kind of selfish. Is it wrong to think less of someone over money and cars? He claims he loves me so much, but I feel like, am I just giving of myself over and over again. One second ""it's fine baby, it's just money."" And the next second I'm throwing it in his face telling him he's a ""manchild"". We don't really have any goals together, and now that I'm saying it out loud it kind of scares me.

What's sad is that I think part of me does love him, or at least I thought I did. I'm SO afraid to be without him. But I'm afraid I've just used him to fill my void of extreme loneliness. But ironically, he does the same to me! He doesn't want me to go on work trips, he doesn't want me to make friends, he doesn't talk to his family (his father abandoned him and his stepdad was abusive) and we really only talk about other people and surface-level things...

To make matters worse, I sometimes wonder if I'm actually a lesbian, or if I'm just craving someone new. I've only had one real experience with a woman when I was 16. I remember really enjoying it but feeling so ashamed that I broke it off with her and told her ""it's not normal. I need to be normal."" I was scared to death of my mom. I've actually confessed to him three months ago that I thought I was a lesbian, and then when I saw him crying I realized how bad I hurt him, which hurt me, and I quickly took it back. He's my favorite person, and I could not even imagine a life without him in it. So I told him I guess I've just been sexually traumatized so many times, I must just be confused. Part of me LONGS to explore the lesbian side of me, but I also wonder if maybe I'm just a covert narcissist and I've gotten tired of him and I'm ready for my next thing. I remember talking to girls in college when I was younger and them saying ""You're such an asshole. It's a turn on."" Or, ""you have such a big ego"". So the dilemna is, I'm not sure gender even matters. I think I just don't know how to love.

The psychiatrist has me on Lamictal, Topamax and Zoloft. I'm scheduled for an assessment at a mental health hospital on Wednesday, even though my husband thinks I'm possibly overthinking everything. I keep having moments where I'm like, ""What are you doing? You're fine. You're not a narc. He's gaslighting you and maybe if left you'd be okay."" And then I immediately start crying and saying ""No, this is you blaming him and trying to hide from your problems because you've been exposed and it feels like you don't know how to cope and you might lose him and your entire life is ruined"". And then I have a panic attack and my entire day goes to shit and I can't eat or sleep or breath. I don't know how to function.

TLDR; I think I'm going through narcissistic moritification. I thought I loved my husband, but now I'm not sure. He's been a little manipulative and abusive, but I'm also at fault. Also struggling with my sexuality, but can't tell if I'm truly confused or just longing for my next victim.",9
149,Abuser or abusée,FrOCD1998,7,q6lkz3,2021-10-12 12:57:09,35,"Having a hard day, please try to be patient with the man that cannot afford therapy at the moment. Essentially my girlfriend and I have been together about 2.5 years and living together for like 4 months. Life’s been hard. She used to be so goddamn hard headed to get her to express her emotions to me. 

She’s afraid and I can see that, but it cause a lot of pain for me. Currently it’s not near that bad and she’s about to make her second trip to therapy. It sucks though cause she’ll say “sorry” about it but I just feel unheard or like it’s not as deep as it should be of like “omg I’m so sorry I did that, I didn’t understand and blah blah blah”. She calls it unreasonable but I can’t help but feel like it is very reasonable. If you look at my old posts you’ll get an idea. 

Feel like I used to make it seem a lot less bad to make her not get attacked by people so that I don’t have to think about the possibility that we need to break up, I’m very dependent on love/a partner for happiness. Currently about to go to therapy for thinking I have NPD, because nowadays anything that is close to her old behavior I get very upset with and attack her as she shouldn’t be doing that. For example, at a party a few days ago I went to introduce her to some friends of mine and she had already been introduced by another friend. She said “babe I already met them” and I kept trying to talk to them to introduce her and she was like “I already met them, I ALRE-DY ME-ET THEMMMMM” and when I told her it embarrassed me she said it was cause the music was loud and she didn’t think I could hear her. So I had her apologize until her tone sounded friendly and meaningful as opposed to monotone. Later she said she didn’t even feel like I tried to understand that it was cause the music was loud and she thought I couldn’t hear.",7
150,"How to deal with debilitating anger, intrusive thoughts and a need for revenge?",inlovewithaghost____,8,635q1r,2017-04-03 09:38:28,6,"I'm so angry about some people's existence and how they treated me. I keep having intrusive thoughts about them, how much I hate them and the things they said to me. The worst part though is that I allowed them to do it. I made the mistake of seeing them even though I knew it was a bad idea but I was really vulnerable at the time. And I am so angry at myself for that. 

I feel like I can't get the intrusive thoughts to stop unless I go back in time so I never made any mistakes, or if I get my revenge. But I can't do that because then I'd go to prison, plus they are so sick that they might see it as some kind of compliment or see it as them still being in control because I'd be giving them attention in a weird way even if it's setting them on fire. So don't worry I'm not actually going to do anything like that. I just can't stop thinking it and the intrusive thoughts about what happened. Maybe there's a way to seek revenge which is both legal and also they won't know it was me. 

Any advice? How do I deal with this? ",8
151,Did I feel empathy?,PrimarySuit858,3,reyndx,2021-12-12 21:22:52,0,"“The first time I met her, we were freshmen in college. We immediately clicked and everything felt perfect from the start. Three days later we made out for the first time, and for the next few weeks we would see each other all the time. We decided mutually it would be best to put things on hold as it was too early in our college careers to be spending that much time together. We needed to find our friends and our footing at our university, and it really didn’t make any sense to be together. We agreed to take a few weeks to ourselves and figure out our lives and find some friends, however that night I made the mistake of making out with another girl. In the moment, I saw no issue with it and felt like it was part of the “finding ourselves”, however she made it very clear the damage I had done and that it made the time we had spent together seem meaningless. It took about a week after that for her to speak with me again, but once we started talking again we were right back where we were. We continued spending time together, but as quickly as it started back up, it just ended. No explanation, no conversation, it was just over.

We have remained great friends ever since, and over the next few months we would do things like hang out late night cuddling or find each other during parties and end up talking the whole time. During this time, we never made out or did anything more than cuddle, however it did not feel just friendly imho.

Fast forward to last year, we both started dating people, yet still remained friends and hung out and talked every time we were out together. It almost felt like we had more of a spark while we had partners than before. My relationship ended at the end of September, and hers ended shortly thereafter (no correlation, just coincidence). Around that time, we planned a trip overseas with some friends as I hadn’t seen her since May when we had left school last. Seeing her this trip has changed everything.

My feelings towards her have always been strong, but now I’m almost positive I’m in love with her. When I’m around her, nothing else matters. I don’t even need to be talking to her. I just need to be in her presence. Seeing her happy brings me more joy than anything else. I think about my relationship that ended in September, a relationship where I thought I was in love, and the feelings I felt in it were not even in the same ballpark as what I feel here. When she texts me, I perk up. We had a few moments this trip of closeness that just made me want her more than ever. Our first night, we were in bed and she started running her fingers through my hair while I gently massaged her arm. It might not sound like anything significant, but I can’t help but feel like she has some feelings still as well.

So, here I am, about to head back to university and she will be abroad until next semester. I’m madly in love with her and have no idea what to do about it because I am terrified of 1) her not feeling the same way and 2) losing one of my best friends. I don’t want to mess things up a second time, this girl is amazing.”

I recently discovered that I am almost certainly NPD/BPD, trending more NPD from the research I have done. 

Here’s my big issue with my above mini essay on the female in question. I don’t know if what I feel for her is because she made a great supply or because I actually care about her. If it’s the supply question, then honestly I would like to stay as far away as possible and let her live in peace. I would definitely identify myself as a grandiose NPD, I think if you handed out a description of a grandiose NPD to the people closest to me in my life, I would lose all my “friends” overnight. It’s a pretty terrifying thought and quite honestly I have been basically mute for 48 hours straight because I don’t really know how to process the concept of “me” not existing. 

The person who I think I might feel empathy for I feel happy in their presence and I think I feel something when they are upset/happy/etc. At least, I feel that I can understand they are going through pain, or they are feeling happy more than I have ever been able to understand it in anyone to this point. My problem is that I don’t even know if that’s true/what I’m basing that off. I know I don’t care about my family at all, my Dad almost died of Alcohol Poisoning this summer and I couldn’t get emotional about him passing, just that he likely has and will never love myself or my sister.

Honestly, I’m pretty fucking lost and am not looking for answers, just for a place to express myself.",3
152,Starting to think I have NPD,Treat-Used,7,nx2rvr,2021-06-11 00:22:57,4,"*This is NOT a self diagnoses*
This past week I’ve been doing mass research on the symptoms of NPD and types of it because I suspect I might have it

It started when I researched “why do I get mad when my spouse cries,” because I was slowly self realizing that I had a pattern of being unnecessarily angry when my gf starts sobbing abt anything that seems minuscule to me (and sometimes it would be something appropriate to cry about and I still felt annoyed as shit) and I got some results that said people who tend to have a great lack of empathy have NPD

I dismissed it at first because my initial understanding of npd was just someone with a big ego and thought they were better than everyone else, and personally I didn’t feel like I was in that criteria but then...

I started seeing research about the highs and lows of emotions—feelings of grandiose(a new word to me lol) and then later feeling really put down. I related to this because I’ll always get into certain moods where I think I’m more than capable of any task at hand (in the moment) and other times I think I’m nothing more than an average person living an average life, in which, doesn’t sound bad to others, but to me, it takes the meaning of living away.

Next is my self esteem regulation. Although I will deny it to death in person, I do believe that my self esteem depends on what others say, or don’t say to me-which can be frustrating because I love to think of myself as “someone who doesn’t care what others think” but alas it’s like a drug to me, and I find myself on petty social media platforms posting or interacting w the sole reason of positive appraisal. (KIK for example, I hate the app and people on there but I find group chats on there anyways and stay there long enough to get hyped up/appraised). I also have a great sensitivity with criticism and will only accept it if I deem you did it in a “professional manner”. Anything else I’ll dismiss and assume you’re insulting 

Another thing is the exclusion anxiety. I figured I only suffered this when I was n school when the bell rang and everybody got up faster than me, leaving me behind. The feeling it gave me felt unmatched but I feel like I still feel that anxiety when everyone clocks out and leaves right before me, or when my spouse gets out the car faster. On top of that, I hate being ignored, specifically when Im just saying hi, though I try really hard to excuse the other person and justify it with “they must’ve not heard me” but then I’d find myself thinking abt that for 20 mins and get mad when I’m unsure. It feels like disrespect to me when you don’t acknowledge someone within a certain radius of you with the exception of being busy. But if you’re just walking doing nothing and you ignore my greeting i think about how much you must think you’re better than me for not saying hi back and my anger sits and boils for a long while after— to the point where I’d hold “subconscious grudges” lol 

Now when I read about how people w NPD value people and their relationships with them my eyes widen hard asfff. I used to think I had a “unique” mindset of only interacting with people that could benefit me the most, or hanging with people I thought had the most potential. This can often become an issue because I’d look down those who didn’t seem to care much abt their future or if they seem like they’re wasting potential, especially those who happen to have better circumstances than me. I have the greatest expectations of them and always think about how much more or better I could be doing with their circumstances, building a weird envy toward them. (Unmotivated rich kids got me fucked up the most!) 

And Speaking of value of people I’ve read something about state conscious where you form mental hierarchies in groups you are in. I relate to this because I am very picky about what groups I interact w because I don’t wanna be the dumbest or weakest person in the room. I wanna be held in a comfortably high position or come in at a point where I can get into a comfortably high  position among them. Thru this tho I may exhibit a sense of confidence and knowledge that I don’t actually have and try to fake it till I make it or leave and find another group. This can range from social media group chats to real life situations 

There’s a bit more that makes me think I have npd but I wanna cover it in a separate post when I talk my personal relationships and how I respond/react to things. But other than that, what do you think about my situation",7
153,Can you come back from the unthinkable?,Whykennethwhy,32,n77bwl,2021-05-07 19:53:15,6,"I was so angry that I couldn't see straight.

The only voice I was listening to was the one in my head and it was telling me that I was right, I was right, I was right.

I was sitting under the sun and feeling myself burn and wanting to burn. Wanting my skin to blister, wanting sun stroke.  Wanting to collapse and be carried off in an ambulance.

I made one stupid, childish decision after another. I compounded them. I gleefully made bigger and more foolish and more impactful decisions KNOWING that I was spiraling out of control.  For nothing.  Because she made me feel a little responsible.  Because I was not really paying attention and she pointed it out.

She made a decision. One that I could have stopped her from making. It would have made all the difference if I had stopped her.  Instead, I turned and walked away without looking back. Because how dare she.  Now instead of one elephant there is a pack of elephants in the room and there's barely enough space to breathe.  Now we're ignoring the elephant graveyard in the room.

I made a decision that hurt her because I am a selfish and narcissistic person and do not like to take responsibility for my own actions. What I'm forced to take responsibility for my actions I react with anger. I shut down emotionally and I lash out. My defense mechanisms are offensive.  It does not matter that I love this person, it does not matter that I do not want this person to hurt, it does not matter that I do not want this person to die. And I do love her and I don't want her to hurt and I don't want her to die.  

I don't know why I'm writing this post. It's so huge I can barely think about it, let alone begin to talk about it and try to unwrap it in the hopes of dismantling it.  She is feeling despair. I am feeling despair.  

I just want her to know that I know I hurt her, badly, and it is because she wanted me to take responsibility. I want her to know that I know how apocalyptically disproportionate my reaction was.  I couldn't say this to her face because I'm a coward.  Because I'm afraid of my own reactions.  So I'm leaving this for her to find.

I love you.  I am sorry.  I should have stopped you.",32
154,How do y’all handle your emotions? (Specifically Sadness),Illustrious_Add,5,qgyxnv,2021-10-27 15:12:53,5,"So basically i have happy, disgust, and anger, and just existing.

First off the only emotion i show is happy or apathetic/numb. I will never in public show anything else.

If i’m mad i wont show unless i’m 1 on 1 with someone or i’m at my house or similar place. 

Of course then there’s disgust which is common because i think of others as inferior and weird

Then of the time i dont have emotion unless i’m talking to someone and have a laugh

My main question was sadness. How would y’all describe it? I can’t truly seem to feel it. I’ve tried so hard to cry when i’m in the dumps but i can’t. The closest i am is feeling numb. I literally cannot cry from sadness and i dont know why? I’ve cried from trying to control my anger and impulses when i’ve had a narcissistic breakdown. 

Basically just curious on how y’all work in that way?",5
155,I think i might be a narcissist but i want to change.,Pure_Ad5290,24,maj6mo,2021-03-22 09:16:59,24,"I think i might be a narcissist.

My [F20] childhood was not good. I spent most of my early years in fear of my stepmother who i believe is a narcissist. She would abuse me mostly emotionally but also physically from time to time. Examples of this were me not being allowed to eat at the same table as the rest of the family (my dad, her and her other children), being treated worse than her other children (although she did mistreat them as well) not being allowed to show negative emotion such as sadness and anger, and living in constant fear of what she might to next.

When i was not at my fathers place all my negative emotions came out. I was extremely angry towards my mother because i did not feel as she was protecting me by still making me spend every other week at my father’s place (i did not know that she was trying her best to get sole custody) i lashed out at other children at school by being violent and a bully. I was extremely jealous at other children who got attention from my family members, especially my mother. And i learned to manipulate people to get my way at a very young age.

I lacked empathy throughout most of my childhood and i got to hear this often. I do have empathy now but not as much as other people. I did not have issues with breaking rules.

When i became a teenager i started doing illegal things such as taking drugs, stealing, robbing people and being violent. This got me in lots of trouble because i was very small and not capable of inflicting damage as i was before. This led to me being the victim of violent crimes myself.

I have a strong sense of entitlement, i cant stop lying and i manipulate people everywhere i go. My relationships have consisted of idealization, devaluation and discard. 

I have very strong emotions and mood swings and lots of people think i may have bpd. I can agree with that to some extent but i do not have the same fear of abandonment that borderlines have. I only have fear of abandonment in the early stages of a romantic relationships, but when i feel that i have the person under control i do not feel that anymore.

I lie a lot. I have created a whole fake life and it can get tiring to keep my facade up. I tell different lies to different people to make each person like me. Nobody really knows me because i lie about everything. I also keep telling small and irrelevant lies in my daily life and i cant seem to stop.

I cannot take the slightest critisizm and i get very angry when someone dares to critizise me. I have very low confidence but at the same time i feel that i am superior to others, i believe i am smarter and prettier than other people and when i feel like someone does not recognize that i feel shame and rage. Before the pandemic i was around other people all the time and got told i was pretty and smart by different people daily. My ego was very inflated. Now that i dont spend as much time around people and dont get that positive feedback i feel like i am worthless.

Now i am in a relationship with a guy that i really care for and i know he wants the best for me. I keep hurting him and abusing him and i regret it afterwards. I really want to change for him since i really do care for him but when i get angry all that disappears and i only want to hurt him. I use him as an emotional puching bag but i really do not want to do that. 

I read that narcissist do not want to change, if that is the case then what am i? My behaviours align with narcissism but i am aware of them and i do not want to be this way. It causes me so much pain and chaos and i really do not want to live like this.

I go to a psychiatrist from time to time and i am on mood stabilizers for my mood swings. I dont know how to tell them that i think i am a narcissist for fear of not being believed or them disliking me. I want to talk to a psychologist but dont know how to explain my situation.

Is there anyone here in my situation that really wants to change or anyone who has gotteh help for their npd? How did you do it?",24
156,hello r/NPD,ShallotRelevant8423,3,qoqp3h,2021-11-07 15:24:03,6,"hi i'm a 14 yr old girl with narcissistic traits, is it really just a phase or am i stuck with it?

i wasn't really abused as a child but i have a very f up family. My grandpa is a grandiose narc, my aunt exhibit vulnerable narc or bpd traits, and i think my mom has vulnerable narc traits. Everyday my grandfather and grandmother are fighting. I don't have a father figure. I'm also a bright child, I studied at the most prestigious school in my town and the most prestigious high school in my country (please don't take this that i am flexing). I guess it's also what i think the cause. My grandmother constantly taught me that I was the smartest kid in the class and that I was studying at the best school. She raised me to compete with other students.

I think i exhibit NPD traits and I also manipulated friends. I forgot some in my elementary school but during high school, I manipulated a friend. She wasn't an empath but she was similar to me, she would talk bad about other people with me and she judges them easily. We clicked. The first weeks i was  so sweet to her. I would always hug her and sleep with her. One time she had a period stain, I immediately informed the nurse and covered her up, I even ran her to our dorm. Then after a while i got bored and then dumped her. I also talked bad about her behind her back. Compared to me she was much morw beautiful than me and I hated her for that. There are more instances, but the most recent is that I only have 2 friends right now, and when my friend posted a pic with a large group outside, and to add salt my other friend had a childhood friend that she will chill with. I was so envious to both of them that I had a depressive episode.

The thing that I really hate about is that I think that people would always look at me. It was weird because I was so scared of messing up or doing something weird, but at the same time i feel like every thing i do is weird, and that everyone judges me for every little thing I do, but at the same time when I feel like no one watches me, i feel undesirable and not special. It really sucks because I missed so many opportunities because of this. I also think that I lack empathy. Instead of being happy with my friends accomplishments, I feel so envious and angry that I hate myself. I don't feel anything when any of my friends are happy or not or my family are happy or not, I just feel happy or sad with someone if the thing that makes them happy or sad could inflict me the same way as them. I was sure about this because one time when my friend got caught because she had low grades, instead of being sad or angry to. her parents like she was or like my other friend was, all i felt was that I was nervous if her family would see her chats with us. I feel very alien. I think this is also why i don't know how to feel if a song is full of emotions or not.


im sorry if this is a lengthy post, it's very unorganized because im anxious right now. im just really scared because i can't live like this forever.

Edit: I am not saying I have NPD, I am not diagnosed. But I think I have narcissistic tendencies and have some traits.",3

158,inability to accept being a victim,idkwhyimadethis29701,6,i47ssg,2020-08-05 15:51:04,8,"tw//sexual assault 

idk how to title this tbh, but bear with me. ive noticed a pattern of thought i always have, which is under mo circumstance would i allow myself to be a “victim” because in my head no matter how fucked up the shit i go through is, how badly someone treats me i HAVE to be tough and take it, i CANT be weak

ive gotten stuck in abusive relationships before, and it was never like “i love them i have to stay” it was more like i stayed to prove to myself that im strong enough to handle this, if i left, if i called it abuse, it would feel like running away, being a weak little bitch, it would mean admitting that this person had power over me which i could never do, so i’d stay and abuse them back to “balance” the power dynamic. this has been so toxic and exhausting for me because i refuse to admit i needed help

ive also gotten sexually assaulted last year and it took MONTHS for me to admit what it was, and still to this day i could never call myself a victim, i refuse to accept the fact that something traumatizing happened to me and that im hurt. only last month i got super drunk and spilled my guts to a male friend, he got very defensive wanted to know the guys name to beat him up, we had a huge argument about it because i refused to tell. because  going to beat up the guy for me would make me feel so weak, it would make everything too real, like admitting someone took my power away, the reality that obviously as a tiny skinny woman i cant take my revenge with my own hands. i got so mad at him for offering me help because i dont want to admit i need help, not from him not from anyone.
does anyone experience a similar thought process? how do you get over it and allow yourself to be vulnerable, to admit that you’re a human and sometimes you need help, that you’re not invincible?",6

I'm not NPD but I have some pretty overwhelming narcissistic traits.  They only exist in my relationships with romantic partners and specifically only come out when I'm feeling threatened.

I am generally, selfless, empathetic, giving and nice but if I feel another guy is a threat to my security or if I feel I'm being overly criticized by my partner I lose my shit. I will scream and shout, say really abusive things, try to subtly cripple my partners self esteem and generally just dish out a whole heap if narcissistic abuse.

Then I calm down, get mortified by guilt and remorse and the cycle starts again.

If I don't feel an ego bruise/narcissistic injury I'm a really nice guy. Then my ego gets bruised by my partner talking about her ex fondly or saying someone is good looking and all of a sudden I turn into narcy the green eyed monster.

It fucking sucks. I hate that guy.",8
163,All of the therapists I have visited no longer want me,Life_Soil6305,0,q6ujsq,2021-10-12 20:09:03,37,"Not only have I shit talked to each and every one behind their back to other therapists simultaneously, but I've shit talked them to their face. I genuinely feel and think like that they are talking nonsense and I feel cheated out of my money. 

The last therapist I visited is ignoring my messages now and I'm burning with revenge feelings. I catch myself fantasizing how I'll out her name in my ""black book"". My black book is the names of people that I'll kill if I get terminally ill and jail time is irrelevant. (which I won't do, I'm harmless coward). I also fantasize how I'll emotionally stress her with death threats, I'll go and spray my feces in her office and I even see myself planning this.


In my head, I'm right. I paid five times and just when I started gaining rapport with her she ignores me? (After I've been low-key verbally abusive towards her the whole time and saying she doesn't think). I'm fuming from the thought of how smug, confident and happy she is. And I'm even more furious that I can't take that happiness away from her. It's not fair. I want my money back. She is stupid and I know better. Thats my mind and what I genuinely believe. But I also realize that there's something very wrong with me. I've had 90+ jobs so far because I've left/kicked out from each one due to drama. 7 therapists, a hundred friends, all broken up. 


There's obviously something wrong with me. Hell, I even converted to Islam (Muslims are great and it's a great religion, terrorists have nothing to do with real Islam) and listen to terrorist music out of hatred, just because I couldn't have my way with the world, I instinctively want people to suffer and die miserably. Even for the smallest thing, like online arguing in Reddit or an online game issue. And I genuinely truly want them to die in that moment. I get quite creative in the imaginary torture I want to deliver to someone who made a mistake in a game and won't apologize. 



I'm angry at this last therapist right now and I will probably go throw my shit in her office and make her smell it and clean it after I run away. I won't let her feel like a winner.  But I'm also angry at myself for not trying to be better. 


Any time I try to be nicer I feel like I'm a people pleaser and everyone is just taking advantage of me. Therapists say I don't have npd but online tests score me as severely 100% npd. 


Idk, I'm lost.

168,“Narcissistic abuse”,Yrhndsaroundmythroat,74,op0qce,2021-07-21 22:33:07,72,"Tl;dr narcissistic abuse is the same as abuse perpetrated by neurotypicals, and it’s use as a term is to demonize NPDs and allow neurotypicals to get away with being abusive themselves. 


I don’t even know why this term is so popular as though there’s some special type of abuse only narcissists have access to. Every article I’ve seen talking about “narc abuse” is just describing regular abuse, but apparently abuse is by default worse and “more valid” when perpetrated by a narcissist than a neurotypical. 

It really bothers me that pretty much every person I meet who has been a victim of abuse describes their abuser as a narcissist. It’s just statistically impossible when the percentage of abusers in the population is far higher than the percentage of people with NPD. Neurotypicals have just as high a capacity for cruelty as anyone with any mental illness. This cultural narrative of narcissists perpetrating the majority of abuse harms the NPD community, does nothing to actually help abuse victims besides giving them a false boogeyman, and serves no one except for neurotypical abusers who are allowed to keep their humanity and fly under the radar as all the anger and attention is deflected onto the “incurable and monstrous” predator NPD is caricatured as. 

“Narcissistic abuse” pins all the blame on narcissists as the sole perpetrators of abuse and lulls NTs into a false sense of security that they can avoid abuse simply by learning how to spot and avoid narcissists. It’s so neat and opportune how narcissists are “inherently dangerous, evil and incapable of change.” It takes the burden off of society to actually try and fix the issues that allow abuse to be so common and accepted when they can simply decide to demonize one group of people as “the problem” and then conveniently make that problem unsolvable by claiming that said group is inherently abusive, thus making abuse an external and unstoppable issues rather than the systemic issue it truly is. 

It reminds me of how rape used to be considered something that only happened in dark alleyways by evil, inhuman strangers thus letting the “good guys” who accounted for the majority of rape cases to get away with it. (Not trying to compare having NPD to being a rapist- it’s the dehumanization and deflection that I’m focusing on.) The idiocy of this herd mentality astounds me. People are so willing to trade the possibility of genuine change for the safety blanket of prejudice and cowardice.",74

Just because I haven't met such a person yet doesn't mean they don't exist, right?  I analyzed all the advantages:

1. An empath is a person who focuses on the needs of others, on their emotions. He/She doesn't focus on himself.
2. An empath is able to sense my mood and emotional states and will not try to upset me.
3. He will not manipulate me.
4. An empath will always console me and make me feel valuable.
5. For an empath friend, my emotions will be important. I will be important.

6. He/She won't ignore me.

7. An empath will always be loyal and will not betray me because it could hurt me.

170,"Ex blocked me on everything. Brushed off being called a narcissist, but was she right? Anyone behave this way? Really want to understand what’s wrong with me…",Diligent_Wrongdoer83,4,q6nr1c,2021-10-12 14:43:47,8,"
We (31 M & F) broke up 3 weeks ago and she’s blocked me everywhere.

I got mad at my ex a few weeks ago and was really mean when I yelled at her - this is when we broke up. I tried calling her a week later to ask if she wanted to go to a festival but she told me she was out of town. I texted her afterwards and she responded but it was short and polite. Then last week I called her because I had a panic attack and thought I was going to have to go the ER. She texted me later that day asking if I was okay and cracked a joke.

Anyways, when we had broken up before I started seeing this younger woman (22). It was very casual. Right before we broke up that same woman started following me on social media, liking my pictures, posted this old picture of my dog, and was snooping on my ex’s social media too. My ex brought this up to me and I got annoyed with her because I hadn’t talked that woman in a long time. Well after we broke up. Out of anger, I added this girl back on social media. A few days ago she flew out to stay with me and my ex found out and sent me a text saying, “enjoy your time with ___” and then blocked me on everything: my phone number, work phone, IG, FB, & even Venmo.


I should add, we broke up before and she blocked me on social media and then we eventually got back together. This is the first time she’s blocked my number though.

We were together for 3 years by the way. Anyways, she had called me a narcissist but I brushed it off. Now I’m wondering if she’s right. Anyone else with NPD act this way? If so, why??

I was dating a man who told me to read a book on Charles Sobhraj, because he said he’s exactly like him except he doesn’t kill people. I guess he was trying to tell me he’s a psychopath? I’m disturbed bc if I’m honest, I can see him that way, yet I’m deeply drawn to him. I spend most of my time miserable bc I want to be treated
better/commitment, but I get such a high from any interaction with him even though theyre Emotionally never fulfilling. Examples…
1) he likes to remind me that he abandons Everyone and likes to be able to leave any situation without Warning . Like how a company tailor made a position for him and Bent over to his demands then he left within a year, for no real reason (though rumor had it he was kinda forced out for being reckless). and he says he never Should’ve even been there Bc why didnt he stay in his home state w his kids and wife?! Says he doesn’t care. Even if people are very upset with him it means nothing

2) I could tell him I’m upset over something serious at work and he’ll blankly stare, never comfort. Empathic Phrases like “I’m sorry” or “that must be so hard“ literally don’t exist. If I’m talking about a recent hike he might interrupt me right as I’m describing the summit to start hooking up. he’ll never stay the night. if I put my arm around him he‘ll shove it away. sex is as cold as can be

3) If you say something like “since you’ve been out of town on business all month, now that you’re finally around this weekend I thought we’d spend it together,” he loses it and says not to expect anything of him and as soon as hd feels any demands he will punch his way out of the proverbial box to be free. Obsessed w being free and not attached to anyone yet if I were to see other guys I’m a terrible woman and how dare I.

now anyone would say he is toxic and I should get away. Obvi. so why am I so attracted and obsessed, and around more normal guys I feel panicked like I’ll get bored and went to leave? If I can’t cure this guess what, I’m going to end up old and alone chasing a Personality disordered guy… but I cannot force myself to want someone more normal! i was married to a guy who on the surface was fine (actually emotionally empty\lots of problems but I digress), and I couldn’t stoMach the thought of the rest of my life without passion.

*Is there any hope for fundamentally changing yourself or will it always just be changing your behavior? Thanks for reading.*

First of all, thank YOU for sharing, knowing that there is one more guy whom I can relate to makes me feel much better and less lonely.

The fact that you believe yourself to be an NPD means that you[ probably are right](https://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-how-to-identify-a-narcissist-with-one-simple-question-20140805-story.html).

BPD and NPD are totally related. Prof. Sam Vaknin has mentioned in one of his videos that it was concluded in the past (70s? 80s?) by someone smart (Masterson?) that BPD is NPD incomplete.

Imagine having two harmful guys. One is a raging, angry, neglected and hurt kid with no sense of self. The second one exactly the same, but on top of that, managed to develop a luring, deceitful persona, a false-self. Which one is a bigger problem, and which one is harder to fix?

I like to think that NPD is BPD evolved. Unfortunately, I also believe it to be a ""bigger problem"", as it carries more shame and a bigger threat. If BPD is angry and chaotic, NPD is the same but a better actor, who seems more integrated and sometimes a powerful presence. If BPDs have no sense of self and thus look chaotic, NPDs have a created a false self. It kinda works for us, but sometimes it does not. And we react with the dreaded Narcissistic Rage when the Narcissistic Self is injured. I believe the biggest NPD in history was Stalin.

My judgement might be off and my memories are not as clear as I'd like them to be, but I think I remember being a BPD before I evolved into an NPD. I was preparing for two suicidal attempts, first one when I was 10, second one when I was 14. It was a pure attempt to execute *talionizing revenge.*

Perhaps I wanted my parents to acknowledge... To realize that they have sorta fucked up. Nothing else worked, they were dismissive and completely unavailable. I was not treated like a human, and as an adult, I apologize to the world for failing to grow into one. NPD is a developmental trap that locks you in an early stage of maturation. Congratulations, your real-self, aka your emotional age, is probably around 5 years old.

Luckily, although I was on the very verge, I never attempted the suicide. My brain started working and made me realize that *talionizing revenge* is actually stupid and sorta nonsense. Why would I be fixated on trying to fix and educate my parents? My reality is shit because I am forced to go through emotional pain, because I was unlucky and born to *idiots*. I generally don't like calling other people dumb fucks, but I make the exception for my parents.

But I'm not enmeshed anymore, I have no contact with them for years. If I randomly met one of them on the street, or if they called and tried to 1. apologize or 2. spurt more nonsense (unconsciously trying to mess with my head further), I probably wouldn't even react emotionally, I would just brush them off, laugh and tell them to go to hell. Because **I have grown and flew out of the nest**. **Broken the cycle. I ain't trying to establish a family until I conclude that I am ""fixed enough"".** I wouldn't want to raise malignant babies who could potentially become a threat to humanity, because **I am, in essence, a good guy**. Well, at least according to the theory of fundamental good, I was born one. And for sure, I wouldn't want a human being to go through the same shit that I was forced to go through.

It was fairly easy for me to stop being enmeshed to my parents because I was barely *attached* to them, I was mostly *dependent* on them. *Not everybody has nice parents* \- I thought as a kid - *and I seem to have bad luck.*

I only survived thanks to one realization, a rationalization. Luckily, I was genuinely a smart kid with weirdly high IQ. I came to the conclusion that *I don't deserve to suffer, because everybody, every human, has the innate right to be protected from harm and to be happy. Shitty upbringing (shitty caretakers/teachers) are merely bad luck. But soon, I will grow up to be an adult, and I will become independent of them.* ***I had to stay strong!*** *As the smartest kid in town I knew that* ***I was born with a right to admiration, acknowledgement and empathy that every human being has the innate right to.***

But as a child, my thinking was not as mature as it is today. I had to find a way to cope, and I found a good solution - I started perceiving **the callous and insensitive people in my environment** as *dumb, inferior dipshits, room temperature IQ levels, empty sacks, a disappointment, defective and broken creatures.* Every human would feel better if they ego-syntonically believed that *they are the best, and that they do not deserve to go through this hell*.

Through a mysterious mechanism, perhaps because I was too starved, the thought that ""*I was born to be loved, it's an injustice that I'm not!*"" had somehow evolved into the dreaded... entitlement.

The rest is history... The only problematic thing with the narcissistic solution (adaptation) is that it sticks, and it goes haywire. This year, just like you, I realized that I have NPD. And curiously, through the combination of my *very hot genes (*[temperament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperament)) and my environment, I happened to evolve into a fucking book example of NPD. A *Cerebral Narcissist*, to be more precise (""Malignant Self-Love: Narcissism Revisited"" by Prof. Sam Vaknin).

And by *book example* I fucking mean it. It's not fun to read a book about assholes, only to realize that I'm the main character. I fucking meet 8 or 9 out of 9 criteria in the DSM-5. In the DSM-5 it's written *Narcissistic personality disorder is also associated with \[...\] substance use disorders (especially related to cocaine).* I couldn't get my hands on coke but I am on a fuckton of amphetamine as I'm writing this. And I try to avoid cocaine because *I know myself.*

When I was going through this realization, I had suicidal thoughts, thoughts that I believed I had defeated forever since I was 13. But they returned! And I felt hopeless, felt some first real emotions in a long time - I literally felt being empty and had a physical sensation of cold, an existential cold...

I've been working on my alexithymia and emotional awareness for \~2 years now, trying to become more emotionally-intelligent, astute and self-aware. I thought I felt something, but it was akin to *cognitive empathy* (cold empathy). It wasn't real feelings that I would feel connected to.

Thank god, I have self-diagnosed myself, learned some shit about Cluster B and psychology, made my own fantasy (reality) shatter and collapse upon me, making me feel the weight of all the *wrongness, misconceptions, disorders and fallacies that I wasn't exactly aware of having till now.* Again, I was suicidal for a brief moment, it would be surprising if I wasn't because *shit's heavy*.

And despite feeling scared, cold and empty, it was a relief to finally feel something.

I will tell you only one thing - I would do it again. I don't want to live my life deluded. And there's hope. I've heard numerous times that as an NPD, I'm a problem, a hopeless case. I will offer my advice - don't listen to those dipshits, their diplomas and licenses are toilet paper to me. Whenever you start to believing one of them, you should start carefully inspecting the person making those claims.

I will hint you a red flag, so that you know what content is not worth of your attention. Avoid content created for the general audience. It's mostly advice for girls who can't get over a toxic or abusive boyfriend. (For all of those girls reading this - I do not mean to invalidate your pain, I happen to have had toxic and abusive parents so I think I can relate to your feelings. They're less painful than mine. For you it takes a video to feel better, for me - it took much more to feel better, I had to develop a nasty Personality Disorder from the Cluster B).

I do not mean to criticize a well acknowledged Mental Health Professional (with millions of subscriptions). But, she's demonizing us the most. And perhaps I have (through my curious mental apparatus) devalued the fuck out of her (in order to feel better myself) - I believe her to be a woman hurt and abused by a Narcissistic EX. That's what she claims made her study psychology. It's in one of her videos made in response to the hate and criticism she constantly gets. Look up for Dr. Ramani. She is indeed doing good things for humanity, protecting them from *us.* Dear Dr. Ramani, I hope your business is doing good, I wish you a happy life, ideally in a world where *we* are kept in some sort of a zoo. It's not like I'm a recovering person who wishes to change. So desperate to change that I'm doing drugs so that I can read more books on mental health. It's 3 PM and I didn't even eat yet. **Fuck you.**

\--------

You don't need to convince me how shitty and unfair it is because *I fucking know.*

I am kinda open about my disorder. Sometimes people ask me:

***""Can it be fixed?""***

it's a question to which I have only one answer:

**""Depends on who you ask.""**

And I've ranted enough, I will try my best to answer your question now:

\--------

*I’m more effective at interacting with people now, but I’m not sure how I can get rid of the underlying narcissism that had once caused me to act in undesirable ways.*

We do not have a clear answer to this question. First of all, I couldn't possibly claim that *I've recovered enough to be ""normal"" again.* It's because I have no idea what *normal* actually feels like, I can only imagine. Everybody perceives the world differently.

I will tell you what could possibly give me an idea of *what normal feels like*. In the Ghost In The Shell anime (Stand Alone Complex), people have cybernetic bodies, only their brains are real. You can connect your brain to another person's brain through an USB cable and then you would have entered their cognition, felt their feelings and became them for a brief moment. In the anime, the cops (because it's the cops who inject themselves into the captured criminal's brain) have a nasty headache after doing that.

That is the only thing that comes to mind that would give me an idea of whether I've *recovered enough to be normal* *again.* If such technology existed, all I would have to do is hijack a *normal* person's brain and become him for a day. Only then would I have a clear idea of what *normal* feels like, and in turn, I would have the point of reference needed to conclude whether *I'm normal again or still yet broken*.

That's why, in my very honest opinion, the question *is it possible to become normal?* Is not very productive, because you will never be sure. You should listen to me, because I am a Cerebral Narcissist, and I've been deliberating over this question last friday, yesterday and today morning. What a waste of time, procrastination via indulging in philosophical dilemmas. I would be better off if I did something productive instead, and so would you.

Focus on the things that you do comprehend. Focus on the things that you understand today. If something is unclear, yeah you can seek help and advice on Reddit, but you can also ""leave that shit for later and do the easy and obvious fixes first"". Perhaps as you go, the long seeked answers will become vivid.

Listen to Jordan Peterson. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz2tYGt0\_As](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz2tYGt0_As)

From his 12 rules of life: Rule 4: Compare Yourself to Who You Were Yesterday \[rather than to somebody else\].

The idea of *normal* only exists because other people exist. Asking if you are normal means that you are indirectly comparing yourself to others. If you don't see the problem with comparing yourself to others, go and watch or read some Peterson. Tl;dr - comparing yourself to others is a waste of time and usually not productive.

\------

There is another way to view this. Let's agree for a moment that *early childhood, pre-oedipal stage etc. set you up for life*. I can totally understand why it feels crushing and heart-breaking for you. I was suicidal when I realized that. *I wish I had a time machine.* I would say that *what matters is if you believe or not*, but I consider such advice to be *immature* and *toxic positivity*. It's just as disgusting as hearing that *""you don't have a problem"".*

One guy has insisted that I am normal and repeated it four times, said that I have a sense of self and I should stop being so negative. What I did was, first I realized that the son of a bitch is gaslightning me. (I learned abt gaslightning and how to spot it from Dr Ramani's videos). Then, I vividly demonstrated to him the traits of a Cluster B guy - *unstable, impulsive, irritable, aggressive, reckless and with impaired empathy.* I have gone too far (again), but I don't even feel sorry for him, despite him being my best friend for a month (I get over it quickly because I have a strong defense called *splitting*), because motherfucker had gaslighted me. He also represented antisocial traits, stole bicycles for a living since a very young age (continuing to this day), and was a junkie. (I have devalued him in order to feel better and less guilty over the loss of a friend).

Jokes aside, I do feel guilty, not because I exploded at him, but because I didn't have enough empathy to make him a real friend. He was a mere narcissistic supply (and a good one at that). I was blinded by my vampiric instincts which are still active. And NPDs sometimes choose inappropriate friends, because they are blinded by the pursuit of narcissistic supply. I learned that from Prof. Vaknin's book.

And one thing is sure - that fool is now probably much better educated on the matter of Cluster B personality disorders.

\----

Well, back to the question. Is it possible to recover? Well, it depends who you ask. I will give you my personal opinion at the end. But, what if it's not?

Some people are born tall, some are born short. If you are unfortunate to be born short, you can choose to be a bitch about it. Or not. Whichever you prefer.

Similarly, some people are born with a hot temperament and some are slower.

Would you agree with the statement that you are *really* faster, more impulsive and perhaps a smoother talker than others? Less patient? Are you more emotional than others?

A hot temperament is believed to be one of the contributing factors towards the development of NPD. And can see why it would make sense. If you are more sensitive and more feel hurt than others, normal coping mechanisms will not cut it - you need to do something crazier. Like murdering your real self and putting a false construct in place. You don't need to feel guilty about it, if we hadn't done that we would probably have killed ourselves.

I have a sister, 9 years my senior. We both agree that we've gone through a lot of shit. She's the only one who could understand me, because we've literally gone through the same shit. We have different fathers. My temperament is hot and she was always more withdrawn. She has confessed that she also believes herself to be broken.

I have turned Narcissistic. She had turned Schizoid. It's wonderful how I can observe the temperament theory in real life.

Some people are born short while others are born tall, some are born handsome and some ugly, some are born faster than others, and finally - some are born and raised *normal*, while others are born and raised *to develop a curious personality adaptation.*

You could choose to complain and be depressed about being short. Blame god. I think *normal people* get over such feelings when they are about 13 years old. They grow up.

You could choose to complain openly. Or you can hold it in, it will rot. Or you can choose to *grow up* instead.

What if I told you that

a) NPD is a developmental trap that locks you in an early stage of maturity. It makes it impossible to grow.b) NPD makes you feel inadequate. It was created by you in order to cope with the feelings of inadequacy and rejection, at an early age.c) It worked, you're still alive. Good job and congratulations. However, in your adult life, the solution of the past is causing the exact problem it was devised to solve. It makes people reject you, therefore making your worst nightmare - rejection - a reality.d) Therefore, it no longer makes sense to sustain the adaptation. That is exactly why your wish is to disable it - or *to recover from it*.**e) The only way out is to grow the fuck up. And with great effort and internal strength and motivation, overcome point a).**

I think that, at this point, we take it for a fact that your temperament is *abnormally powerful*, so you've got all the strength you need.

What does great effort mean? Well, depends on who you ask. Therapists say it takes 10 years. They also say that the self-discovery phase (that follows the collapse of the fantasy) makes us go depressed and it's extremely painful. Elinor Greenberg, Ph. D., calls this phase the ""Paradise Lost"". Dr. Todd Grande says that after disabling NPD, you turn to ""Avoidant Personality Disorder"". You wake up from your dream to find yourself in reality.

Spoiler: reality is shit. Get used to it.

They claim that it takes a year or two of depression before it starts to feel better. It depends on the person. For me, it took \~two months, because a) I'm young (25), b) I'm fast, c) I'm extremely neuroplastic, d) I'm a fucking cerebral narcissist and my desire to know the answers is obssessively-compulsive. I literally do Amphetamine and Modafinil to read books on NPD recovery. When I go too fast and I feel overwhelmed by the *painful* recovery process, I smoke a joint and it becomes bearable again.

However, you should not compare yourself to others and you should not compare yourself to me. I am a living example of ""don't try this at home"". Especially, you shouldn't abuse substances. Don't do it.

\-----

I'm already tired so I will just point you to some things and tips that helped me

* Fix Childhood Emotional Neglect. Books like ""Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents"" or ""Running on Empty, Overcoming Childhood Emotional Neglect""
* Dr. Todd Grande, Prof. Sam Vaknin, Dr. Elinor Greenberg
* Advice directed towards BPDs seems to be also helpful for NPDs. I find it weirdly soothing to listen to YT videos of BPDs talking about their problems. And there's more content.
* Focus on self-discovery. Nobody parented you, thus you need to re-parent yourself as an adult. It's a fun thing to do. What is your favourite colour? How do you feel? What do you want to do in your life and why?
* Be mindful that sometimes *you think you want to do something, but it's not the real you that thinks - it's the deceitful false self, and it's steering your thinking because it's hungry for narcissistic supply.* At the age of 25, I've had like 10 different jobs, I excelled at all of them but I can't exactly explain why I did them. I just found myself doing them.
* Do some empathy developing exercises. Example: empty chair from Gestalt Therapy
* Download some NPD workbooks (Dr. Daniel Fox)
* And of course, go to therapy. Personally I'm not attending, because true NPDs who live up to the character don't go.
* Just do your best!

I would offer to be your friend, but I don't recommend myself as a friend unless you are masochistic. Good luck bro. You're not alone.

I promised to share my opinion on whether it's possible to recover or not.

Years ago, I met a fascinating half Jewish - half Ukrainian girl who studied psychology. I've instantly fallen in love, but I only saw her for a day or two.

I asked her a question about psychology because I was always curious about things. I don't remember the question, but I remember her answer:

***We have a saying in Psychology. ""That depends"".***

I sincerely believe that recovery is possible. Despite being handicapped, I believe that I can become a serene being. Even if my emotional empathy is beyond repair, I can still rely on my cold, cognitive empathy. I just need to use it better. I've heard that recovery is possible many times. I've heard Dr. Grande say ""*recovery is possible, I've seen it happen*"". Well, he is the doctor, not me, I'm not gonna argue. That guy seems to say it honestly, unlike Dr. Ramani and other professionals who seem to hate narcissists.

The guys from anti-narc camp seem to employ a tactic that is actually more characteristic to us, the NPDs. When asked a difficult question, they respond with ""Yeah, yes, yes, BUT... NOOOOOOOO.""

*- Can NPDs be treated?*\- *Yes, but I was just trying to make a dramatic video about the evil on this planet, let's not talk about fixing them because I need more views and subscription.*

\- *Can NPDs be treated?*\- *Yes, well, despite the fact that that they are among the most difficult patients, some of my (inconvenient) colleagues have claimed and proven that recovery from NPD is possible... As a mental health professional I can't deny that... BUT, IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THEY ARE DANGEROUS! They snap at me in my clinic! One of them was threatening to kill me! Let's split the fuck out of them and conclude that they are evil! HERE, there are the 10 tells that allow you to spot a narcissist!*",14
176,Got in a fight with gf about following each other on social media - Am I The Asshole here?,11incogneato11,3,mkaod7,2021-04-05 02:28:45,14,"I will try to be unbiased as possible but I had a terrible row with my girlfriend last night about our Instagram accounts.

Im not big into social media but I have an IG for work purposes. It's private and only my business partners and work colleagues follow me on it and a small handful of very close friends. I have 1 post. I follow a bunch of creative accounts on there for work inspiration.

My gf used to be very active on social media and when we started dating I asked her to chill on the constant posting and just focus on us for a while. There's nothing I hate more than a chick who can't stop posting on IG/FB.  She understood and stopped posting on Instagram.

So as a result it's been a year since either of us had any posting activity on our Instagram accounts. I never think about social media so it's not that important to me.  

Yesterday she asks me to follow her and to accept her friend request.  I tell her no because I never post anything and I only use IG as a moodboard to save things for work projects.  She asked me why I don't follow her account and I told her because she hasn't posted anything in a year and I see her every day so what's the point ? 

She got pissed off at me and said she stopped posting because I asked her to when I thought it was a mutually respectful decision we made to focus on us and not social media.  She said she wants to start being active on her account again and it wouldn't hurt me to just follow her account.  This turned into a big row and now we aren't speaking to each other at the moment.

WHAT is the big deal with social media? For fuck sake I live with her, I see her every day, she can show me what's going on in her life right in front of me.  And she can see on my account I don't post pictures and I don't want to make my profile public, plus I'm just using it for work inspiration. This is the reason I had us stop using social media from the very beginning because some people place too much importance on it and turn it into an extension of their lives.

AITA here or is this rather silly of her to be upset about?",3
177,Any of these BPD symptoms resonate with you?,Paganistic_Emperor,13,q24ddi,2021-10-05 20:05:00,4,"Diagnosed NPD for a long time. But shit happens and I split hard the other day. The unfortunate kind where everyone except for you are all bad. And I found myself dissociating before hand. I'm not sure how borderlines experience splitting but I imagine it's similar, and it got me thinking about some traits I have that make me wonder if I'm just BPD lmao here's some I was reflecting on

1. Splitting obviously. I know other people with NPD split but I'm not sure how that manifests. Spirals where I think everyone is lying and making fun of me and are awful people are the only times that I'm like ""oh yup that was splitting"". I'm sure I do it more often than I think though.
2. Dissociation. Every now and then I'll dissociate hard. I'm never sure if it's personality pathology or my ptsd though. (Even though the two are obviously linked so maybe the distinction isn't that important) Usually people just assume I'm drunk when this (or splitting) happens so I usually blame it on that or the PTSD since they're more likely to understand that than personality pathology. 
3. I hate the term, but ""favorite person"". By that I mean one person who you're extremely emotionally dependent on that people in the BPD subreddit talk about. For most of my life I didn't have that, I was just super dismissive of people's attempts to get close to me. But now I feel like that's changed. I have one friend who I talk to about my shit alot and she recently took a few days to herself (she has schizoaffective) and It's really impacted my emotional spiral. I despise that I'm that dependent on someone but oh well. 
4. Fear of abandonment. This one is super weird because I know I to some extent have this but it's mainly unconscious.  Like I will feel like someone abandoned or betrayed me and I'll always show anger and a dissmisiveness towards anyone implying I'm hurt by it, but afterwards unconscionably I always find myself drunk and crying. I usually don't even connect the two events. Maybe it's a fear of being unlovable who knows. 
5. Emotional liability. This one is also tough cause I'll go weeks or even months being basically numb to everything, then one little thing happens and I start self destructing and a whole spiral happens. During that my emotions and self esteem are all over the place. It's really overwhelming.

There's probably more than just those but that's all that come to mind right now. Obviously BPD and NPD are closely linked but I struggle to even see the difference sometimes lol Anyone have any thoughts on this?",13
178,obsessed over a person for years? Anyone else?,tronzoat4am,20,q3ypgm,2021-10-08 14:19:47,5,"First of all I'm not diagnosed with NPD but I'm diagnosed as having OCD and narcissistic and avoidant traits.

As the title says, I've been obsessed over the same woman for two years now.

I've talked about her with my therapist for months and from a logical point of view I don't have much of an attraction neither for her physical appearence nor for her personality. However, my therapist says I've both idealized and devalued her so it's hard for me to understand. He also thinks the reason I'm fixated over her is because she is basically what I'm not and what I would like to be and I'm envious. I think she is attractive and has many men wanting to be with her ( women, in my case), she is very intelligent ( I'm scared in the back of my mind I'm in reality an idiot but I am not) and she has a superficial charm where she can captivate people instantly and can make friends easily ( something I struggle with).

I also obsess over if I was more handsome, richer, or more charismatic, or more X or Y I would ofcourse be with her.

At the same time, I hope something bad might happen to her. She is pretty poor and I hope she stays that way, or she might not graduate and stuff like that. I know this is bad but it is what it is.

Talking about her with my therapist makes me feel bad and embarassed about myself because I spend time thinking and talking about her while she probably never thinks about me ( at the same time I'm convinced she thinks about me constantly).

At the start she was very affectionate with me but also very hot/cold, one day very affectionate, others not so much if not downright hostile. She also had a problematic youth being bulimic and her dad left her when she was young. She is often pretty angry and aggressive for very trivial things. She has been in a LDR for years just seeing the guy in person once or twice a year. I think she has deep emotional issues.

Is something like this common in your case? Any opinion?

I would like to say I don't think about other people all that much, if not rarely. I'm confused because the most I'm obsessed with is myself and my personal issues.",20
179,Do you pity people who got abused but who had it coming all along?,ImfrenchThankGod,0,por91o,2021-09-15 14:30:41,32,"Whenever someone I know gets abused by another narc or whatever I simply cease to see them as human. It's like a part of my brain shuts down and loses its ability to respect them stops. Hell it's even worse at times,it makes me feel like abusing them myself,spitting on them,punching them or even getting closer to them only to emotionally abuse them even more. I despise weak ""people"" so much.

 Most of them are women even,like there was this chick at a part time job I had who got in touch with some loser who pressed her buttons and made her fall for him bug time. But after he took her to pubs where he got wasted,pissed off the wrong people and lost teeth,he got bored of her and cheated. I can't decide whether it was pathetic or outright hilarious to see it. She was melting down,poor little thing:(
 So what I did was flirt with her,grab her ass and be the shoulder to cry on and then,once she made it clear that she was into me I just smiled and left. We were in a subway,she was staring into my eyes,begging me to kiss her lmao. Can you even imagine the audacity? The stupidity? This creature genuinely thought she had a chance with me. What a pathetic display. What a sad abomination. I blocked her on all social media and ignored her for a couple weeks until I quit. 
 This was the only instance in which I was actively involved. But I've seen it DOZENS of times. Never have I ever felt sorry for the victims,I mean we're animals after all. Who feels sorry for a zebra they saw on tv that was too slow and got caught by a lion? No one.",0
180,Self-loathing,apeironeyes,6,njcmo1,2021-05-23 17:34:02,2,"Hi everyone. I have covert narc traits, and anger management problems. My  irritability might be because of anxiety/overstimulation from autism, but ultimately it doesn't matter when I snap at people :/ I'm just being an asshole. My intentions or what I'm going through doesn't  matter. I'm working on it now and improving, but I definitely was  impatient/short with other people and reacted very negatively to  criticism before.

It's  getting to a place where several people people are taking revenge on me  (by gossiping behind my back, making me look like I made a mistake when I didn't, etc.) and it's giving me pause. I never thought I  could be the sort of person who could do something so bad that I would  ""get what I deserved"" or deserve to have bad things happen to me. I  can't blame anyone who's had to deal with my irritability for hating me.  And I can't blame them for taking revenge. I think they're in the  right.

I feel so much self-hatred  and shame sometimes. It makes me want to keep acting out because I feel  like I'm a terrible person who deserves to be hated. I reached out to  someone whose feelings I hurt some time ago, and they responded. I felt  shock and I cried. And part of me wanted them to not respond - part of  me wanted them to hate me for the rest of their life because I guess  part of me feels like that's what I deserve.

These  feelings are super unproductive. I know the only thing worth doing is  trying to make amends to the people I've hurt, and try genuinely to  change. And accept their rejection and not expect anyone to be nice to  me even though I'm trying to improve. I feel like part of me thinks I  can't handle other peoples' rejection if I genuinely try to work on  myself and they still hate me forever, so it's like I'd rather just not make amends and just accept them hating me forever. I know I'm thinking about  this in a delusional/self-centered way - no one owes anyone else  forgiveness or understanding, especially when I've been rude or hurtful  to them.

When other people are  rude to me, it makes me angry, even though I know their rudeness is  warranted if I started it. I try to be nice but then I feel like I come  off as passive-aggressive/fake nice. I am trying to cultivate a real  deep kindness inside myself but I guess it's going to take time.

Has  anyone been through these feelings, that they deserve to be hated by  everyone? How did you move to a place of genuinely working on yourself  instead of trying to punish yourself somehow by wanting other people to  hate you and failing to make amends or even continuing to hurt other  people? I know this is so toxic, because it is about other peoples'  feelings and lives not just me. I want to change but I feel like I get  in this loop of self-loathing.

Thanks for reading. You can be really blunt in your responses, too, if you care to respond.",6
181,Need to vent,throwawayyy383838,1,qm2y34,2021-11-03 20:05:28,5,Dont know if i have npd but i need to vent. I cant stand when the girl im talking to is active but wont answer. It lights a fire in my soul and i get very angry. Idk how to stop it. I basically tell myself its ok to get mad bc shes probably answering other people so why not me? Is something wrong with me? The only time i can self reflect and understand im in the wrong is when im high. If im not high its hell on earth. Im so self destructive.,1
182,Hi I don’t have empathy for anyone,Prince9307uptop,1,m6ogty,2021-03-17 01:11:15,21,"I was a bully as a kid I bullied this kid named Zander who drew cars because I wanted to Idk why I did it till this day. One time I took his sweater and he tried to get it back so I stepped on his knee. Idk if I actually hurt him but he didn’t get up and some girls picked him up and took him inside. I always remember getting told on because I used to say things but I don’t remember what i said. In high school I had 7 girlfriends four at the same time and I told each of them they were amazing but in reality I just didn’t care they were toys that would do anything I told them to.  I cheated on my ex with three different people in the same school and I would get caught by them and just said I wanted them more then the other girl and kept cheating. I knew I hurt my ex for 2 years she found out about the other three girls. She was madly in love with me. I thought I was just a player I was just normal but all my relationships were based on the foundation of scare tactics and violence and not being a victim I literally made friends who could protect me I don’t rly care about them I would hope they die (well everybody in my life) so I could be upset and get to act irrationally or hurt whoever was responsible. One time I was at six flags and I remember threatening the dude who was managing the go cart because he miscounted how many times we went I remember grabbing him and feeling liberated to get physical with someone. I love fighting and attacking ppl and seeing ppl be attacked. I don’t like anyone bc their just another person I don’t know how long I’ve been like this but everyone is just a game of stay in my life so I don’t look like a loner or so I have protection. I recently got dumped bc I said my gf was a weirdo I said things before that upset her but I thought that she was weak or just being her but I do it all the time I even apologize just to get her to give me attention. I don’t know what to do or how to apologize to the ppl around me because they don’t know I’m just here to manipulate them and that their interchangeable. I treat friendship as a transaction I just say whatever makes ppl like me I don’t feel their pain I’m just there for whatever emotions they might muster up bc emotions mean violence and I’m good at it it’s straight forward it doesn’t require sympathy or thought. 
I don’t want to hurt ppl but I do I verbally degraded my real relationships and manipulate girls who are suicidal by telling them I would care if they were gone when in reality I wouldn’t care bc I’m the dude with a dead gf plus it’s not my fault the relationship ended she just died. I don’t know where to go from here putting myself down seems like the logical answer bc I hurt ppl in everyday conversations I view everything like war and have said things that are rly fucked up. I still don’t rly feel bad for the ppl I hurt I just feel bad I’m a terrible person ig. I do have two definite emotions that alternate anger and sadness sadness turns into anger 99% of the time and my anger makes me feel like just picking up a knife and stabbing someone to death. I carry knives bc if someone messes with me I would have a reason to cut em. I fantasize about cutting someone down the right side of their face and having them remember for the rest of their life that I cut em. The pandemic is making it easier bc everyone wears masks. I often follow ppl around when I’m bored bc it’s fun to know I’m watching someone and could just run up and stab and kill them and their family and friends wouldn’t know why or who.  I just don’t know how to tell ppl this without them getting scared or thinking I’m crazy. My gf knew I would kill someone and says ur a narcissist all the time but i don’t know if she knew if she would take me back or even trust me.",1
183,"""Narcissistic rage"" -- is it really a thing?",sexy_vampyr,10,m5vrax,2021-03-16 00:03:09,10,"After recently realizing that experience in my life fits pretty closely to what is perceived to be NPD symptoms, I started googling NPD and related problems and found this concept of ""narcissistic rage"".   


I'm not sure in scientific correctness but the description definitely fits what I've been dealing with.   


**""My"" scenario:**

Basically my NPD-suspect person would get really angry for different trivial things or (more commonly) without stating the exact reason.   


Usually couple of weeks prior to that they just colder, again without explaining any reason, just gradually colder and colder. Attempts to find out what was wrong or offer help only made things worse (I wish they told me that NPD or similar problems exist in school or something, but I'm from shithole anyway).  


Eventually they just go raging.  
 

Their state become uncontrollable, whatever I attempt to say is just met with anger, insults, attempts to hurt me (physically I'm safe, but before I learned that NPD/BPD could be a thing I was just plain destroyed) as much as possible, being really mean, mocking my illnesses, etc.   


No matter what I try to say (and I really don't answer with same, I just curl up and beg them to calm down -- ""NO YOU FU\*KING CALM DOWN, I'M CALM"" is usual answer.   


Maximum rage situation usually ends with me being blocked, driven away, etc.   
This often happens just couple of weeks after they say convince me this will never happen again (or, the first time, just few days after they themselves approached me to watch stuff together, like everything's nice).  


Of course so far they've come back after weeks/months with another ""supply"" I assume.  


But during the rage as if there's no memory of anything good that happened (or could still happen) I'm just powerless to stop them, the only healthy situation when I'd assume such could happen would be when they really HATE me.   


This fits what I read about ""splitting"" and NPD-people allegedly not being able to accept someone as both good and bad at the same time (but I'm not expert and not claiming that it's actual thing common to all NPD, please don't beat me up, I already get enough violence from an NPD-ish person I know).

**Questions:**  


* Is it real? (seems quite common if I read posts about abuse);
* Have you ever experienced it? (Following questions are for the case if you have):
* If you're okay with it could you please help by sharing your point of view -- what is it like? Is it that bad? You really hate the person and do not recall anything positive about them? Or is it just a ""tactics"" to get rid of unusable ""supply"" sooner?
* Can something be done to calm such person down if the rage has already been triggered (I believe nothing can be done to prevent it as there is never a definite answer what exactly causes it anyway, could be a thing which was normal just 2 days prior). 
* Is there some cooldown period after which such person would be able to perceive me as ""not 100% bad"" person? Could something be done to accelerate it.   
Or should I assume they ""hate"" me only when they find no use for me but when they're desperate for whatever I can give them they would pretend they forget their hatred/sincerely forget about their hatered?  


Sorry for such questions, I'm just frightened of the situation and would like to know as much as possible of the point of view of someone who could've experienced it because articles like ""Run, they'll kill you"" are not incorrect but not too helpful if I cannot/don't want to run yet.  


Thank you.",10
184,Npd and aspd,Illustrious_Add,7,pqw4f7,2021-09-18 22:39:20,15,"Do y’all think it’s possible to have both Npd and aspd? 

I’m quite certain i have npd but i’ve also shown signs of aspd. I know the only way to be certain is to get clinically diagnosed. 

Anyways, i’m not going to provide evidence for me having npd. As a kid i killed animals. Which is a telltale sign if aspd and that’s one of the biggest signs of a kid having something wrong and possibly becoming a serial killer as an adult. I also have a very short fuse around my family and will make death threats to them. I hate them and literally want to kill them so bad when i’m angry. But around people that aren’t direct family i will never make a fool out of myself. I would never act upon the things i want to because i’m afraid of the outcome but if there was no repercussions i most definitely would. I’m  also impulsive, quite lazy and i have an addictive personality.

185,Advice for learning to control my emotions,Reasonable_Round9015,15,p33x4b,2021-08-12 16:55:19,33,"Now I wanna start this post by recognising I'm a very sensitive fragile person who will get explosive and volatile if hurt. So I'm sorry if your comments offend me and I lash out, I really don't mean to hurt you I just don't wanna be hurt myself. 

So on that note, my actions are really incontrollable when I'm hurt, as you can see. As soon as somebody says something to imply that I'm not perfect I feel a fire burning inside me. I get extremely defensive and will say anything to get them to take it back. 

Jealousy is one of the most frequent emotions I feel. As soon as someone is doing better than me, whether that's more friends, more money, a job that I want, going somewhere that I want to go without me, it really doesn't matter I just fill with jealousy and will start trying to make that person's life miserable so I can feel better about mine. 

If someone tries to say I'm wrong, man I will argue forever and if that person blocks me and I can't continue it physically hurts. I have so much anger and rage and no where to send it that I don't know what to do with myself. 

So yeah I'm an asshole, I know I'm an asshole so I really don't need people to give me more shit for my behaviour I'm looking for advice only. I just feel like all of my asshole behaviours could be managed a lot better if I had better control of my emotions. I just have no idea how to control them. I've tried counteracting them with my thoughts but I don't listen to the thoughts I just listen to the feelings and then my thoughts start trying to justify my feelings.",15

Over the past few years I've made slow but very significant progress with my mental issues, including npd. My emotions and perspective are rather erratic but right now I got this strange sensation of being able to appreciate the sheer scale of other people.

Instead of staring from the top as if everyone was minuscule and unimportant, I'm at least slowly beginning to see them on my same level. And they feel bloody gigantic. It's like my life feels less of a chessboard where each piece is tiny and at least looks like it could move easily. To actual people with height and weight that won't budge except with great effort, and most upsetting of all, who are strong enough to do the same with me without any extra hindrance!

187,"My friend got me to talk to the therapist, three weeks later got diagnosed NPD. How did you feel and deal with the guilt.",Cgreening,7,mxyrwc,2021-04-25 02:22:37,4,"About three weeks ago a friend who I FaceTime and have a great friendship in person  (M21) but whom I often ditch arranged call times and ghosted him too. returned a year later to apologize and things were going well when we callbut I began to start ghosting him again. He then sent me this.

————————————————————

“Hey so we are old close friends and we have always trusted and loved each other, so I wanted to cautiously reach out. What I am about to say might sting. I want to be clear I am not accusing you or trying to hurt you.

there is a small chance that you might have subconsciously been using my excessive second chances to ditching, as a drug. I am only letting you know so you can explore this possibility with your therapist, someone who is far more educated than I. 

You might feel angry or defensive about this, it is ok too. I would feel the same way. I will never appreciate how hurtful this must be to hear. I dropped a heavy bombshell and, to be fair to myself, I don’t know how best to say it. Please be kind to yourself, my perception of you hasn’t changed. I do still really do enjoy your company and always will. You are not mean or anything in person and I really do get excited when we make plans. Know that I can be also be wrong about this. Just something to bring up with your therapist. Please above all don’t feel guilty. If you tell me anything know I will keep it private.”

————————————————————

At first I felt like shit. And a victim. I told my other friends and made them talk to him for me. He never responded to them.

I told my therapist about it, mostly out of anger but we worked at his text. The therapist helped me recognize some truths about myself by bringing up other romantic relationships I had in the past. 

We also acknowledged that I was intentionally triggering his ptsd abandonment anxiety to make him cling onto me for support.

A few days ago I was diagnosed with NPD. I don’t know how to feel. I feel guilty and angry. I don’t like being labeled as narcissist. I hate how my parents(who are shitty in general) look at me. I am now getting additional help. 

I want to improve and get this stain off. I want to run back to my friend and tell him how sorry I am and hope he accepts me.

188,I think my husband has NPD... any suggestions?,Sandy08261989,2,500qg8,2016-08-28 18:40:45,4,"Hey guys, I think my husband has NPD. He has always been a difficult person, but I always just thought he has his ups and downs and generally did not have many problems with him. About two years ago we made a decision to return from the States to my country (prefer not to specify, but we are in Europe). We moved in October 2015. It's been a hell for me since then.

My suffer became so bad I created this profile few months ago a wrote my post into relationships. After that I really started looking for a pattern and looked into various mental disorders that I thought of and came to a conclusion my husband could suffer from NPD. I don't think he fits to the description 100%, there might be also something else going on behind that (explosive anger, paranoia).

Let me introduce you into our relationship, and then I will describe his recent behavior. We met in 2011 when I went to the US to work for the summer. After that he came over to Europe and we spent one year here with my parents, then we got married in the US in 2012. At first we had a lot of fights, he minded so many things about me and my past, but then he eventually stopped and we were fine. We got married, I started working on my paperwork for the immigration, couldn't work right away. Once my papers were done we decided to go for a honeymoon and travel the country. We did, it took us 3 months but he did not like it anywhere so we came back to the city where he is from, his mom also lives there. She was supporting us the whole time with everything, we were staying at her house. We were both jobless and once we came back I started looking for jobs. I was lucky to find something for myself after 6 months, he couldn't find anything ""decent"". I was working for a few months and then we got into a fight with our next door tenants, and his mom, so we started thinking about moving back to Europe. It took us one year to get everything ready, ship all of our possessions and we moved here. As soon as we got here, I knew it was bad because my husband started torturing me from that moment. Just FYI after almost of year of suffer here I booked our return tickets back and we are flying to the States in September 2016.

Now to my husband and his behavior and what lead me to the conclusion of NPD. He has been extremely aggressive and angry. I know I can get a couple of good days with him and then the smallest the least important thing will just outrage him and he will unleash. I tried to hide this behavior from the sight of my parents, but I was unable since it because clear and obvious. During the last year he destroyed all my remaining relationships. This gets confusing and very difficult to explain, but I will try my best.

When we came here, he got all pissed off because his bag was unwrapped from the food foil we wrapped it into before we flew, although nothing was missing or damaged. From that moment he has been bitching about everything - Europeans in general, food, appliances, law, culture, behavior, social norms and everything. I did not go one day without him bitching or complaining about something. This becomes very exhausting but to a certain point when I became emotionally strong against this. He bitches about my family, about my friends, he loves drama and fights. He has been trying to get me into a fight with my parents so many times over nothing.

My husband is lazy, he doesn't work, he has never really worked. Whenever he would have a part time job he would quit it after a while, because he got bored of it, or he did not like something or some people. He has not worked since we met. I applied for him for so many jobs,  of course his qualification is not enough for any decent job and he won't work any low-paying job, although only has high school and no job experience at the age of 28. His mom always pampered him with certain amount of pocket money and that was well enough for him to sustain his needs - gas, coffee, games, fast food. Why the hell would he spend 6 days a week, 8 hours a day standing somewhere making $7.25. His mom and I have been looking into some kind of strategy and thought maybe once we come back we could both do real estate. But he doesn't really  want to do that, I don't think he would even like it. Right now he is OBSESSED with the idea of a stock broker, he thinks he will become rich. He doesn't know anything about stocks, he is not even interested in stock market, of course he is not going to pursue any career in this field! I can't even imagine him having a job because he does not respect any authority, he constantly has a problem with people around him, especially with the people above or with more power than him. He never once did any kind of job search, i applied for at this point without blowing this out of proportion realistically about 500 job positions, from which 200 was here in my country where he had no luck, no interest. Even when he did interview, he never looked at the company, or background, or even the position itself! He just tried to pull off the personal impression which obviously is not enough for a position at big corporate companies.

He can't take any criticism at all. He keeps saying everybody needs to walk on eggshells around his autistic brother. It's not even true, everybody needs to walk on eggshells around him. Any little bit of criticism and he will explode. He will remember things I said about him maybe not in the best light 5 years ago and throw it in my face now. Few weeks ago we were brushing our teeth. We have been using inter-dental brushes and our hygienist recommended him two different sizes - S and L. Instead he assumed he will be ok with buying just one - M. He keeps sticking it into the areas where he needs to put in the smaller size and kept constantly ruining the medium brushes by breaking them after one or two uses, but they are supposed to least you at least 10-14 days. These things are not cheap so I told him not do that and that just outraged him, how can I tell him stuff like that. Nobody can every criticize him. His mom can't say anything to him. He harps on things she has done to him when he was a teenager and will bring it up every time they fight, although it has nothing to do with it.

He thinks he is entitled to everything. He thinks he deserves a good job and a lot of money for nothing. He certainly doesn't have any unique idea for a business, or doesn't want to put time into anything. Working 8-10 hours a day, even more like other successful people do? Forget about that, he won't do it. He just wants to flop on the coach and play games and be left alone. We went to my grandfather's funeral in July of this year he got so mad and embarrassed me. First he got so mad when my cousin (boy) walked up to him and told us to move up away from our parents so they can receive the handshakes from people none of us knew. Then he got mad because when we got to the venue where the wake was, both of my cousins (boy and girl) and their partners were already sitting close to the head of the table. Instead he ended up sitting next to some random guy. He started cursing just enough so I can hear him (probably the guy next to him as well). He was mad, cursing, insulting my cousins, he was mad and outraged, he would barely touch the food. I had to walk him outside, I cried and begged him to stop. He wouldn't. At that moment I just wished he would just walk home and left me there by myself. We returned back upstairs and sat away from everyone. My mom noticed that we are sitting away so called us to bring our chairs and hang out with her. He started getting better and we were talking. Then when guests started leaving, my cousin's fiance walked up to us when he was saying goodbye and he said (in English) ""goodbye ladies"". Then he realized my husband was there and repeated it as like - oh I did not notice you were there and I said ladies. That outraged my husband. Her fiance already walked away and my husband started cursing and getting up saying he is going to knock him the fuck out and beat him up. He was cursing in front of my parents and grandma, who just buried their father and estranged husband.

At the funeral he noticed my cousin (girl) and he fiance that was in previous paragraph were sitting next to their family friend - a young man. They were talking and laughing. My husband was watching them and got all jealous that they were having fun. He thought he is the only person they should talk to and have fun with and how dare they. Since the funeral, we were asked to come over, have some drinks with them, but he refuses to meet them again. He hates them, won't talk about them, doesn't want to meet them anymore. She is my cousin, we have been close friends my whole life and she is one of my two friends I have left... He ruined my relationship with her and her future husband and this is not going to be fixed any time soon.

He hates my family because they will not allow him as much as his mom does. He expects that everyone should be like his mom. Pamper him, give him money for whatever he wants at that time, say ""yes"" to everything. While my parents raised me with the thought that I need to do everything on my own and I get minimum to no help (unless of course it's a serious issue). I don't agree with either of those approaches but you can clearly see which one works better. I have a university degree, I was always able to take care of myself, always worked and bought myself whatever I needed. If I was not with my husband I think I would be more successful because I wouldn't be wasting so much time. I have been out of job for over a year with no income living under my parents roof (he wouldn't let me to take a job while we were trying to fund him one and make extra bit of money). I know it pisses him of that we are staying here. He hates their rules. They have three cars (they own a small taxi business) and they don't let me just take one and drive around, wasting gas. While he is expecting it. Every time we needed the car, they would give it to us, but not for no reason. He is used to drinking on Fridays or Saturdays at his mom's place where we were staying before. We would have a fire in the back yard, have drinks, smoke, and then sing karaoke sometimes until late night or early morning, even when his mom was home and claimed to be asleep. I never felt comfortable doing this, I would rather wait for her to go out or go see her parents or something... He thought we would be able to do this here but my mom goes to bed at 11pm, I have 18 year old brother who is still in high school. This makes him so mad and hate my parents so much that he can't just do whatever he wants...

The scary part is his anger. He has been so angry since we got here (even before but not as much). The fact we live with my parents, don't have money, car, job, nothing. He has been threatening me with breaking things whenever he gets frustrated about something or something pisses him off. He threw food at a wall a couple of times. The worst thing happened about two weeks ago. I was depressed after the loss of my grandfather, and also my grandmother who passed away in May of this year, I have not been doing good, but he wanted to go out and have some drinks pretty much every weekend. I told him I don't think it's a good idea but he insisted. So we drank some vodka, came home around 1am. He turned on some Youtube videos and decided to drink his whiskey he had at home. I was getting tired, I was pretty much sober. He was drinking and got drunk. At one point I suggested I am getting tired - it was around 3 am, I was really sleepy and tired of watching Youtube videos. I thought he was ok with it, he went to the bathroom, so in a meantime I made the bed. When he came back he saw what I did and boy, he got so angry. he started yelling saying this would never happen at his home. I know what was the reason for this - it just pissed him off that at my parents house we don't get to party. That was the whole deal. I would like to forget everything that happened afterwards. He started screaming, yelling, poured himself more drink. Every attempt I made to hug him or calm him down he would just spit at me, push me away or smack my arms, mock me to my face and get even louder. He would become inaudible, saying my parents are a fucking christians (which they are not), mocking them, he stopped making sense and was just awfully drunk. He woke everybody up, my brother run downstairs, my parents were afraid to come up. He took his drink and computer, went to our guest room, started playing loud music. I called his mom, told her what the hell is going on and I don't know what to do. In a mean time my mom came upstairs, asking what the hell is going on. I told her to go downstairs right now and that I will take care if this. I was hoping he will pass out in the other room, unfortunately he just drank a bunch more. He came back to the room, it was about 4:30 am, it started getting bright out. He ripped my blinds out, pointing at the sky, saying at his home I would be still up and singing. I sat on the bed, tried to talk to him, but then he started yelling and cursing and out of nowhere he charged at my door and punched it. The while inside panel flew out and landed in the hallway. I started shaking, I had no idea what to do. In a few minutes I got him into the bed but he wouldn't stop talking literally insanely (was mocking Norman Bates). Then around 5:30 am he finally passed out. I took my stuff and tried to sleep in the other room. In the morning I had to take some pills to calm myself down, I could not sleep, or relax, I was worried, afraid, angry and stressed. He came back to himself at about 3 pm, he remembered what he did and started apologizing. I was very mad at him, saying we are literally going to be here for a month and if this was necessary.

His looks mean everything to him. Spends unbelievable amount of time in front of the mirror, always checks himself. He will get mad at me if I don't tell him one piece of hair is sticking out. His hair is not perfect until it reaches almost sculpture like point. He grew out long hair and beard when we came here and when my grandmother passed in May 2016 I convinced him to get a hair cut at a local haircutter - his hair looked awful - long down to his shoulders, heavy and constantly greasy. Of course, according to him, she messed up his hair and it's my fault. He yelled at me in the street, when we got home, I had to call my mom the tell him his hair is fine, still wouldn't stop. On the day of the funeral of course he had plenty of time, I was ready, he was still showering. When he got done, he did not like his hair, he came to the room and started getting angry with me over his hair and actually spit into my face - because of his messed up hair. Again, I had to call his mom to talk to him because I did not know what to do.

I noticed that he always try to steal attention to himself. He always fought with me on an important events in my life, when it wasn't about him. Even on my university graduation, he made me cry. Generally I feel good and healthy. But when I feel something is not right, he ignores it. He doesn't care about me. I had a serious tooth issue - had to get a root canal done and the dentist told me I need $2000 crown. Of course with my small income we did not have the money. I was hoping once we come to my country I will get it fixed, but it took a year and a half. He did not care about my tooth, wouldn't offer to find a part time job to help to pay for it. But a few months after I got the root canal and couldn't get it fixed, he found out that a small piece of enamel chipped of his front tooth. I had to book him a dentist and pay $300 the next day it happened because he was obsessed that a small piece of enamel was missing - basically invisible spot near his gum line. Also when we moved here I had to get that one tooth fixed. He wouldn't stop bugging me when is he gonna go to the dentist and that he has at least 4 or 5 cavities that need to be fixed. I was getting pain in my root from being open for a year and a half and collecting bacteria, and he was complaining about small cavities that did not even hurt him! On a regular basis he complaints about yellow teeth - that's usually when he has nothing else to pick on or obsess with. We smoke (he got me into this bad habit, I never smoked before). He regularly says his chest hurts and that he knows he's got a lung cancer. Actually for last three days he has been non stop bugging me with that and I know why. For about last two weeks I have been having this pain when I bend over a bit, it feels like it's my lower back, pain shooting down my leg. At first I thought it's coming from my kidney, but then I did some googling and it's actually coming from my spine. Anyway, I don't feel like seeking doctors help, which I probably should, but I have been reminding him I am in pain. Which he doesn't care about, that's why I think he started with his ""lung cancer"". I tried to help him and last week I set up an appointment with dermatologist to look at his freckles, if any of them needs to be removed (he is very light type). I was supposed to drop my mom off at work and take the car to the hospital, but things had changed and my brother was supposed to take us and wait for us. We were in there for 40 minutes and when we came back out I called my brother and he had to leave (my dad owns a cab company and he had to help him with the rides). They were both out of the town and we had to walk home. The hospital is only about a mile away from my home so it wasn't a long walk or anything, but it just pissed him off so much. He was saying that he's got a skin cancer and he has to walk home with cancer. He doesn't have any cancer, there is just one thing that needs to be removed but it's most likely nothing. He had one pre-cancer removed before so this is not like a new thing. We got home, nobody was there and then he just unleashed. Yelling, cursing, threatening. I admit, I only stopped him because I was trying to hurt myself.. I cannot deal with this anymore. I was trying to help him with the freckles and it backfired on me... He calmed down, but the next day he got mad about something again and brought the same thing he already apologized for. Plus he said he knew I won't yell at my parents. Why would I want to start a fight with my parents if we are leaving in two weeks?! He always try to instigate fight and get me into screaming fights with them, which usually doesn't work with me. I am not the aggressive part and I don't get offended if someone drinks a glass of my coke bottle.

My husband hates people. He hates every person he comes in touch with. Maybe not right away, but he will always find some kind of negative quality he can't go over with. Like a typical narcissist, he tries to impress people on the outside. The way he carries himself, they way he presents himself. So many times we have people stopping us and complimenting us how nice and good looking young couple we are. And of course he is nice and polite. But then on the inside, he will criticize everything about other people. He thinks he has some kind of high moral standard and whoever does not think or act the way he wants is no good. He is a picky eater, basically doesn't eat anything, then he bashes people like me straight to my face - who like corn on their pizza - how can someone like such a disgusting thing. Because only he can set the standard of what is good and tasty, in the mean time he only eats chicken, pizza and sugary junk food and fast food. Every meal has to be prepped in a certain way to his liking. If I don't make something the exact certain way he will say it was not as good as usually. Nobody else has a right to like something else. He was making coffee for my parents last night - a small cup. I told him not to put sugar in it - they will do it themselves to their liking. Of course him being addicted to tons of sugar threw three sugar spoons for the smallest cup of coffee because that's the way HE likes it. My mom asked me (he doesn't understand my language) who put sugar in it because it's too sweet. He wouldn't want anybody else to prep anything their way for him but he is so convinced that everything he does or thinks is the right way that he will hate everything else.

He is obsessed with himself. He always worries what other people think or say. He gets very sensitive and often misrepresents things that are being said. I think there might be some signs or paranoia. Since we have been in my country seems like he has been looking for trouble. He walks around doing stare offs with people in a street, but if someone was staring at him, he would get angry. So he does that and constantly waits for someone to say something to him so he can leash out. It worries me that he will get into some kind of fight - which he did one time before, and also got into a couple of screaming/cursing fights before as well. When someone says something, he instantly thinks it's about him. Always looks way beyond some comments, just like at my grandfathers funeral. I don't think there was anything personal behind the comment but that was it for my husband. It was a deadly offense for him and he is done with my cousins future husband. 

I voiced my concerns to my mother-in-law. She knows what is going on and insisted for us to come back and get him help. Which will be hard because when this topic was brought up once he got upset and doesn't see a reason to do that. He thinks he gets angry sometimes and is just explosive. His behavior has not been normal, he pushed everyone out of my life and treated me like a total shit past last year. I don't even defend myself or anything because it will just anger him even more and I did not want to trigger him into breaking something else at my parents house, or see him act a certain way, but this tolerance from my side is done once we move. At this points my parents have seen enough. Everything I tried to hide from them they saw and are aware of. They think he will never find a job or be able to keep it and provide, and I am honestly worried too. They think I should leave him and come back. They even suggested a divorce. But this is my husband, I love him, for the most part he is a nice and funny person. But whenever he looses his temper or something irritates him (which is pretty much every day), or makes him angry, that's it. Everything needs to be perfect to his standards, which means almost unrealistic. Yesterday he got mad because the burgers he was grilling got stuck and one of them split in a half. He got mad. Started criticizing everything, and of course, everything was my fault. But once we move, no more breaks. I am going to stand firm on my terms. 


I was just wondering what do you guys think about this. Do you know a narc who shows similar behavior? Is it possible to get anywhere with therapy. His mom claims it's treatable, but I am loosing my hopes over here. My husband keeps saying he wants to have at least 4 children with me. So far has not provided a dime for our family of me and him. That idea alone is scary. I can't imagine dealing with his unpredictable, angry and explosive behavior and worry about another little person in my life. Our children are not even born, yet he already has high standards about how they are going to be, what personalities and values they are going to have. I read a lot of stories from kids raised by narcs and they usually end up having no contact because their parents are just high standard assholes.... I would never want to bring a child to a situation like this, they would probably end up terrified or hating their father. So kids are totally out of question for right now... Any advice or comment is highly appreciated.... Thanks for reading...",2
189,Narcissistic thought patterns,tinaburneracct,3,po6ss7,2021-09-14 16:58:05,2,"I’m going to therapy in a few weeks so this isn’t a “am I a narcissist” post because I get that nobody knows. But can your thought patterns change? 

I have very NPD-ish thoughts and then immediately after I feel like a bad person for having them. Classic black and white thinking, putting people down for their weaknesses and arguing with them in my head, fantasies being the most attractive/sought after person in a room. And the worst one - imagining the attention I’d get if a friend passed away. I never act on these. They just come into my head and boost my ego for 5 minutes. Then I realise what I’m doing and think “fuck I’m disgusting piece of shit for thinking this. I’m not worthy of love” etc 

I don’t know if I’m a full narc or just narcissistic traits - and I’m not asking you whether you think this makes me one or not. I’m just simply asking can these thought patterns be changed. Because I’m aware that they are far from reality. I don’t crave success, I just want to be happy. I’m just tired of thinking of nasty scenarios like this and feeling bad about them after. Btw I’m 19.",3
190,Does anyone find the idea of “self hatred” extremely unrelatable?,DeathNote55,1,mg7xl7,2021-03-30 04:32:30,16,"I see so many folks around me who feel guilt, sadness over what they’ve done if they deemed it immoral, hatred at themselves for whom/what they are, and these people feel it enough for it to be a regular emotion. And it’s like.. most people who do this. I feel like an alien because I’ve never felt self hatred in my life. If I fuck up, I always just take it easy because narcissism won’t ever let me feel bad about myself. Hell, I’ve even violated my own (unstable) morals but I didn’t feel bad about it. Even tracing my memories back since forever, I can only recall retaliation and anger against others who dared to criticize any of my flaws rather than ever being upset I had any negative traits, even if I was fully responsible for them. 

This isn’t to say I have zero negative emotions, but these types of (abstract?) emotions like guilt are so far and few in between- and self hatred is nonexistent. Thankfully, the only struggle that this brings me is that I don’t know how to deal with it when my friends/family experience these emotions, and I usually need assistance. Otherwise I’m navigating blind.

I know a lot of people say that narcissists are secretly self loathing, but I genuinely am not. I’m always on a pedestal. How many of you relate?",1
191,Do I sound like a narcissist??,sadclowndyke,12,llnjbb,2021-02-17 06:02:35,14,"
I’ve been really worried lately that I am a narcissist (I have already been diagnosed with BPD for years). I have talked to my therapist about it multiple times and she told me that I am not a narcissist, rather I might have a more “narcissistic type of BPD”. That makes sense to me, but I am curious if I have both NPD and BPD. The reason I think I’m a narcissist is because I want everybody to like me so badly and I always feel rejected bc I read into peoples behaviors too much which makes me feel either really suicidal or really angry. After every interaction I have with somebody I start to think of all the things that I said and that they probably think I’m weird or awkward. I always worry that somehow I offended people, even though rationally I know I was given no reason to think that. I always play interactions over and over again in my head and think things like “oh I should have talked to that customer longer” or “I should have hd the courage to tell that person i like their shirt” and stuff like that. I just think somehow me not doing those things was offensive. I don’t know if that makes sense. When it comes to coworkers and stuff I really want them to like me but constantly feel rejected for no reason. I also feel like I need everybody to know everything about me. If I start talking about something personal, I want to explain it in full detail so that I’m not misunderstood and therefore invalidated. I constantly think about the past and fluctuate between extreme guilt and extreme anger when thinking about certain people or situations. I do have a lot of trauma and bad experience with relationships. Although the people in those relationships were not good to me, I know it doesn’t excuse my actions. For example, my one ex who was actually a covert narc would tell me she’d kill herself if I left but that doesn’t excuse the fact I stayed even though I didn’t want to. I hurt her and I feel bad. I also feel like because my emotions are so big, they suffocate the people around me. My BPD meltdowns are so frequent and out of control, I am blind to others peoples thoughts and feelings during them and after I want to die out of guilt. I take everything personally and I know that’s wrong and I need to change that. For example, if my girlfriend says another girl is pretty, I’ll interpret that as “she thinks I’m ugly” or “she wants to be with her not me”. This is actually strange because this is not something I experienced since my BPD was at it’s worst. I wonder if my experience with my previously mentioned ex changed that, since that relationship made me lose two years of therapeutic progress. Complete relapse in symptoms. Idk I hate who I’ve become. In 2019, I was so well managed, I was able to use my DBT skills, I was able to balance areas of my life. Now, I don’t know what to do. I’m a bad person and all of my illnesses are acting up. I need to get better for my family and my girlfriend and my friends. I keep fighting to keep them happy. I cannot be narcissistic, it’s not fair to them. Please help me find a way to adjust these behaviors. Sorry for the long rant. Thank you.",12
192,Can anyone help me understand my boyfriend he might be a narcissist? I’m feeling stuck and trapped I’ve done so much research before thinking he might have NPD and I’m graduated with a psych degree before just assuming. I love him but I’m at a cross roads.,runhappy18,6,m0nhti,2021-03-08 19:16:34,12,"( 25 f )I’m going to make this as short as possible : I am an empath for sure I would say ironically like I’m a nice girl with for sure mental health issues like I suffered from anorexia , depression and anxiety. I had a long relationship before he treated me well but we just both wanted different things so it ended mutually. Good relationship I never cried or hated my life during that time. With that being said I have an understanding of a healthy relationship. 

I have been suffering for a while now so : feelings ?  Never and my feelings do not matter and I don’t even need much if I’m being honest. But this dude is like a robot and I asked him why he loved me and he said “ your generous and I am easy to talk to”. At first it was good and he did love bomb me but not as much it was as I read about. The feelings and no empathy I saw very quickly. 

Which brings me to anger : he has lashed out multiple times over the smallest things. A good example of no empathy mixed with anger : I told him I wanted just a little note anything to make me feel appreciated and one time he told me he wrote me a note and than hid it in my apartment and I went searching for it everywhere all for him to say he didn’t actually write me one but he was joking and when I cried because he knew how much that would have meant to me he got so angry and screamed at me and I didn’t know him anymore. I sobbed so much he ended up saying sorry but still justified his actions saying it was just a joke and I am way to sensitive.  That is a really good example and if needed I can give a ton more that slowly chipped away at me and broke me down. 

I’m a loving sweet girl straight up not perfect I have issues but I always leave him sweet notes and cute shit and I’ve been told he doesn’t need them and doesn’t care. When I bring up the anger and lack of empathy and he lashes out at me only starting this cycle of saying sorry than doing something nice for me until the next time he gets angry and does something nice to fuck with my head.

Space : going days with out talking to me and calling me crazy for calling him out for it. I once surprised him with dinner and he said I only did it so I would guilt him into coming over. Wtf

Break up #1 : came over “ future faked” told me flowers everyday oh the false promises haha and nothing ever happened. Promised therapy and that didn’t happen. 

I kept going but the lack of any attention and care broke me down I give and give and he takes. I must have more issues to fix also because he continues to tell me he doesn’t care anymore because I’m “ always starting fights” but I just have to try and stand up for myself but every time it gets twisted back at me. 

Break up #2 : I even got told when he pushed me to be angry “ do you even remember what you said 5 minutes ago” and he told his mom I was abusive which is a joke. I just tried to express I couldn’t do this anymore because I was tired of trying and he knew what I needed and I stuck around for all this emotional abuse in hopes he would change. This time was awful he twisted the whole thing on me he was so good at manipulating me I ended up apologizing for breaking up with him how the hell? That it was my personal issues that brought on the second break up. Insane I have no clue how he did it. Like I said I have my own issues to which I’ll own up to and I get therapy for but when this shit started happening I started to think I was less fucked up than I thought. 

I love him very much when I say I’m less fucked up than I thought I am not trying to be so mean but I’m so angry that I have allowed myself to be treated like this and making myself think maybe I’m a little borderline because all my friends see how awful I am treated and how sad I am but I choose to stay because I see the good times. I really don’t know but I try to be self aware and I go to therapy every week. Very high highs and very low lows in this relationship 

It’s gotten so bad as to anytime he uses a certain tone I get scared or anxious and I’m scared to leave because of what he will say to me or do. Sometimes I wish the abuse was physical so someone could see what’s happening and also because those scars seem to heal but this has fucked me up forever.

He is a average looking person lol and I would say I’m pretty for him to not ironically sound narcissistic but I prefer the dad bod and he drinks more than he works out. After all I’m at athlete with an eating disorder so someone ripped just doesn’t do it for me need the balance of you will. But he thinks he’s perfect umm he’s super messy but he is obsessed with being the best at work. Won’t shut up about his old fraternity days and how good he is at work. 

- rough childhood is an understatement abusive environment and has told me he has no issues at all he’s totally fine so he doesn’t need therapy .  
- Or god I’m a Christian and he said he doesn’t need anyone else but himself ( no religious commentary plz just pointing that out  ) 
- started to convince me I’m to needy or to much 

I also reached out to his ex and we are now friends and turns out he abused her way worse than me. She’s been my rock through this but I honestly just reached out to her because I felt like I couldn’t have been the first girl who went through this. 

And I still hope for better what is wrong with me.  After all this I still care for him or I’m trauma bonded I don’t know. 

I can’t say how many times I just need simple things from him that he hasn’t given me but I’m doing the best I can knowing his childhood and I try to be patient because I love him. 

Anyways is he a narcissist are these red flags and should I leave ?",6
193,"Autism and narcissism, questioning whether I have narcissistic tendencies",mikelmon99,12,q2fc5s,2021-10-06 07:18:42,4,"So being autistic I've always resented this stigmatizing notion that we are robotic narcissists who lack empathy, and having been accused a lot of acting too selfishly since as long as I can remember it's something I feel quite defensive about. However this last year I've started watching the wonderful Kanika Batra, a YouTuber diagnosed both with ASPD and NPD who makes videos about Cluster B personality disorders, and I've started recognizing a lot of narcissistic traits in me. I'm sure I don't have NPD, since I completely lack what seem to be some core components of the disorder (inability to regulate my own sense of self, constant need for attention, sense of entitlement or expectation of others' admiration and/or special treatment, self-esteem totally based on external attention and admiration, using techniques such as love-bombing, having a narcissistic supply...), but I've come to realize I exhibit some features typical of narcissism.

Like most autistic people, I do experience empathy more intensely than most neurotypicals I'd say, despite my poor theory of mind typical of autism often coming across as lack of concern for other people that's not the case at all, however I must admit experiencing intense empathy doesn't usually drive me to be the kind of person who is all the time doing things for other people, rather the opposite actually. For a long time I've told myself that I don't give myself enough credit on this regard and that neither do other people, and that barely been able to do things even for myself due to my severe executive dysfunction it's completely ok to prioritize myself over others the way I do... but that's not the whole truth, I've come to realize I truly am extremely self-absorbed, not only in the sense that I'm often lost in my inner world (hence why my self-esteem isn't based on external attention and admiration, I turn any craving for that inwards) but also in the sense that, despite the intense empathy, it's very very easy for me to just not taking other people's needs and concerns into consideration when making a decision, often completely lacking the notion that said decision will affect other people and not just me (which again could just be the typical poor theory of mind of autism).

I've also realized that I may be have a little bit of a huge ego. I may not crave attention and entitledly expect others' admiration and special treatment at all, but my ego gets wounded completely out of proportion by little things other people say on like a daily basis, multiple times a day (at least I'm self-aware enough to realize it would be completely unreasonable to get genuinely upset at someone because of this little nothings, which I hardly ever do). I also am extremely envious, comparing myself to the people I envy all the time and feeling personally victimized by lacking what they have (again, at least self-aware enough to realize it would be completely unreasonable to let the envy poison my view of the people I envy and starting resenting them for that, which I hardly ever do either). And despite always having rejected any notion of me being superior to other people, I do have a sense of been special, unique, one of a kind... which I think is pretty common in autistic people like me who have been labelled and treated as a ""gifted child"" by everyone since as long as I can remember. And without a doubt, I'm pretty obsessed with fantasies of unlimited success, ideal love, power, brilliance, and beauty. I don't expect others' attention and admiration nor do I feel entitled to it, but fantasizing about those things definitely inflates my ego and I do it all the time, which from what I've read is a textbook narcissistic fantasy lmao

Lastly, in conversation I do often come across as pretty arrogant the way I present and defend my viewpoints, like I conceited know-it-all, but I attribute it more to my autism making me express myself in too absolute terms when I don't mean to pontificate at all (I never do to mean that) and also making me express myself in a too formal register that often comes across as pedantic, and I also tend to speak over people and interrupt a lot (which again could be just the autism, and the ADHD which I also have) and to redirect conversations towards myself, my viewpoints, how I experience and respond to the things that happen to me, my special interests and topics of passion...

So what do you think? Does this sound as purely autistic traits that can superficially come off as narcissistic but which in reality aren't narcissistic at all, or do you think there's more to it than that? I'm not too bothered about it either way, as I've said there's no way I have NPD, which would of course bother me, but I think having non-pathological narcissistic traits is as bad (or as good or as neutral) as having non-pathological selfless traits, I don't see narcissism as an inherent bad thing (only when it gets to the point of a full-fledged personality disorder or is pathological in any way). As I've said I'm extremely self-absorbed, so this is me merely overanalyzing the shit out of myself just for the sake of thinking about myself, one of my favorite things topics to think about lmao not being too bothered about whether I have narcissistic tendencies or not.",12
194,Alexithymia,Jas_on_reddit,37,nkztsh,2021-05-25 20:57:43,10,"I spend most of my time emotionally numb, emotions are stressful and I can't (also don't want to) deal with them. I don't really recognize the feelings inside me, they're more like a background noise. Sometimes I can't even tell if they're good or bad.

This leads to rage outbursts and depressive episodes, even if I numb them off they're probably bottling up.  I can't be productive if I fall into introspection, if I let myself feel, so I just put everything aside. I don't want to perceive my non-existent self-worth, I don't want to perceive anything unpleasant. I want to be disconnected, and so I did.

Do you experience alexithymia too? Emotional dissociation should in theory be pretty common with npd.",37
195,I can't get my victim to believe I have strong NPD and leave me. What should i do?,raf_miyagi,17,kpdxpe,2021-01-03 04:47:32,15,"I was in a situation where I led someone on, gave out mixed signals, and moved on like it was nothing. Said things that shouldn’t have been said if no real relationship was going to happen. A common love bombing and discarding scenario. 

This happened the summer of 2019, and I didn't get to truly apologizing and admitting what happened until May of 2020. Between that time, I often times ignored and heavily deflected, yet she said she at least wanted a friendship if I can't do a relationship. When I got to realizing my mistake and apologized, I agreed to be friends with her. I genuinely wanted to get to know her more. I was hesitant at that point, not because I wanted to continue ""discarding"" this person, but because of how it is simply hard to have a healthy friendship when my victim still has feelings for me and is still very scarred and angry about what happened. I didn't know at this point that my tendencies were specifically a part of NPD, so I did not know the importance of things like ""no contact."" I just thought of it like, ""isn't it hard to have a healthy friendship after a failed relationship that ended on bad terms?""

So we stayed friends, mind you, since this is a pandemic and I finished school and moved away, it was all online. We had a lot of meaningful moments together that felt genuine, talked on the phone, played games together. I felt closer and genuinely started to regret how I hurt such a great person.

But we often would argue, happening at least once a month, sometimes every two weeks. Since I was the one who hurt her, complicated things, I wanted to try my best and listen and validate her feelings of anger. But often times, it ended up getting escalated into a full blown argument, finding myself deflecting still. So whenever those arguments happened I suggested maybe we shouldn't continue this. I still didn't know I had NPD but it was obvious that she was hurt by staying friends and I had a hard time being able to deal with that. I told her that multiple times but she would say that she would be going through shit regardless if we were friends or not, and accused me of trying to discard her again. And I hated that I had to keep bringing up ""ending it"" every argument because I know that's another tendency of narcissists. I had a father who threatened to walk out on every argument. But I also felt like I wasn't just giving up or trying to discard. It felt genuinely toxic for her.

So about two months ago, I stumbled upon online resources that led me to believe I had NPD. And a month ago, I opened up to her that I might have NPD. She agreed I had tendencies, but didn't think she was still chasing that ""high"" with me whereas she actually chased the ""high"" in her abusive relationship with a past narcissist, and said it was different from that. She agreed that NPD is a spectrum and not black or white, and applauded my efforts of admitting and growing, saying she is still ok with being friends. But a week later another one of those arguments happen and I really have a hard time being able to sit through and listen to her pain. I no longer raise my voice or talk over her, but often it gets escalated to her crying. So I propose ending this but again she thinks I am easily discarding her. She admits its so hard for her to move on because she has abandonment issues and she's had a very lonely life. I tried my best to explain that ending it is best for her, yet because I brought up ending it so many times, she thinks I've been wanting to discard her the whole time. I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I need a long period of time to become a better person but it's so hard when it feels like I continue to make the same mistakes.",17

I didn't respect his space and kept messaging him goodmorning, asking how he was, what was he doing. I feel like when he wanted space I felt bad because I wanted to be there to support him and plus I feel like my fear of abandonment went into overdrive so I latched on harder. 

I started noticing he was adding more girls on Facebook and Instagram. But that is because he met them at the funeral and were mutual friends. But him wanting space plus him doing that made me insecure and I questioned him about it. I said ""you can do what you want, I don't care, I am just curious as to why you are adding all of these girls"" He said they were friends and social media doesn't affect our relationship at all. I make a big deal out of nothing. I feel at fault since he had enough on his plate with grieving, but I couldn't let it go. I made it about me.

Then there is one mutual friend of our we have known for a few years. She is overly flirty. A week after his friend died he got drunk and said infront of me and his friends that 'she is a tease and has a nice ass."" I was hurt and upset by that. I talked to his friends to make sure they took care of him and that they would make sure he got home and I left. Turns out his friends didn't help him so he had to call his mom. But I made it all about me, I should have ignored it and stayed with him because he was grieving and didn't mean it.

Then a week later I noticed he started following the girl he made the remarks about on Instagram. I never felt so hurt and disrespected. I texted him asking why, I was so upset. He told me ""you are only saying this to get it off of your chest, you only are saying this to feel better about yourself. We are all over here at my dead friends wife house with friends, we are drinking and you do this.' He was mad and didn't talk to me for days. 

Then there was a benefit going on for his dead friend. It was at a bar with all of his family. I didn't go since my ex and I were having problems and I didn't want to feel uncomfortable. But there I go again, being selfish and making it about me. I should have went to support his friends family since I had a relationship with them too and always went to their house. My ex asked why didn't I go, I said because we were having issues. He said ""you worry about the wrong things. No one knows we are having issues. This isn't about us. This is about supporting them."" He was right. He ended up dumping me. I feel so guilty and it is all of my fault.",5
198,I want to have NPD,Abdullah7714,2,mt0mzb,2021-04-17 22:31:56,9,"I myself probably suffer from BPD. Fear of abandonment I get is intense, I keep shifting who I am, my mood is all over the place, when I’m out with people I feel happy but then when I’m home I feel shit. Only thing I don’t do that people with BPD do is blame themselves, I don’t tend to blame myself for arguing with people or anything like that.

My closest family have said I am probably narcissistic after my dad but that can’t be true. I may seem narcissistic to them sometimes because I guess we argue a lot and I guess I don’t have to be good to my family because I know they won’t abandon me so I don’t have to worry about them abandoning me. And that’s why I probably don’t care about giving back much I just take from them, as they told me. 

I have too moods when with my friends. If I am in a good mood I will probably act a bit cocky and show off. But when I’m in a bad mood I’m less confident and a lot more submissive. And I realised that in my friend group I’m usually not the one making up the plans, we usually do what they want. When I suggest something they’re usually like no do it this way and it just pisses me off. Sometimes when I want something bad I guess I’ll be more stubborn. 

I guess I have some narcissistic aspects to my personality such as liking to show off or when something good happens to my friends I usually don’t feel good about that. Because the good thing didn’t happen to me. But like I said I’m too submissive to be narcissistic and I do have anxiety and also some kind of social anxiety sometimes as well. Also I hate starting confrontations because it just gives me extreme anxiety. Especially with my friends because maybe they’ll get really angry and I’ll lose the argument, they will get really mad at me and befriend me. Or I’ll embarrass myself real bad. 

I just wish I didn’t have these shitty emotions I wish I could feel invisible all the time like people with NPD, I had glimpses of that feeling but I rarely get it and it’s when I’m in a good mood. I wish I wasn’t this shy, I wish I was able to be more open and just not this anxious as I know I’d be able to accomplish great things. I’m into politics I could talk to crowds, talk to any girl, be a great leader but the fear of confrontation, embarrassment and awkwardness just doesn’t make me who I wanna be. 

Fml I just wish I was narcissistic or like a psychopath with no feelings of fear, abandonment and anxiety.",2

201,Can someone with npd have social anxiety?,Miss_miserable_,12,pjacui,2021-09-06 22:43:39,10,"I read many things about this topic online but I can't find a clear answer. Some people believe that social anxiety is the exact opposite of narcissism and there is no way a narcissist feel social anxious because he could never doubt for himself. From the other side some people believe that social anxiety is connected with covert narcissism and its a very possible for someonecwith npd to be afraid of being judged and critisized and have a passive aggressive behavior.

But it seems like they indicate that people with npd just use social anxiety to manipulate others, they pretend to be low profile and shy but at the sane time they seek attention from others. They don't demand it but they somewhat feel entitled to it.

Personally this explanation doesn't give me the answers I look for. I understand that they fear of critisism and rejection may have some narcissistic roots but personally I don't feel that I use social anxiety to make others like me more. I genuinely worry about their opinions and I really doubt for my own worth. I also worry a lot of times if I bother others not because I want to be admired but I don't want to create any conflict.

At the same time I feel angry when people don't give me attention but in certain aspects. It bothers me when people don't admire me for some traits I have or they invalidate me. I take it very personally. And I can admit that sometimes I tried to express in a passive way my accomplishments because I wanted recognition. 

But when it comes to my general social interactions I feel inferior and I'm very harsh with myself because I worry how I will ask for something, how I will avoid people, how I will not make any mistake etc. And I feel very insecure for my appearance and my social skills. When people look at me I don't feel flattered and eye contact makes me so uncomfortable. If someone say to me that they remember me or if I become the center of attention I feel scared. It's like I want people to have me in their minds as something important but for certain things and don't show it in real life.

It makes me confused because I'm for sure a social anxious person to the point of avoidant but I also have many narcissistic traits and I think highly of myself. I believe that in reality I feel very insecure and inferior, I hate myself and I just use narcissistic traits as a defensive mechanism I guess to protect me.

What is your opinion? Is there someone who can relate? Do you believe that someone can have npd and social anxiety together?",12
202,debating if i have NPD tendencies,lexie48,2,q40eh4,2021-10-08 15:45:35,5,"i really don't want to seem like I'm trying to self diagnose or speculate something that may not even be true. but I've been feeling so fucking off these last few years, summing it up to my OCD and other indirect issues, yet I still am not comfortable with myself. id like to possibly get some insight that i could relate back to my psychiatrist since this is something I've been wanting to discuss with them.  

for some background, I was bullied as a child and left out of having friends. i guess going into middle school I was introverted and worried that I would embarrass myself somehow and be left out once again. I've always been close with my family but have had difficulty feeling true love for them. this in part comes from my OCD. my intrusive thoughts have created these awful versions of them in my head that yes i know are not true but i just can't let go of. i bring this up because i already know it has some connection with the symptoms I'm having in regards to NPD, but again i am not super educated on this topic, hence this post.

for the last few years (say middle into high school) ive had difficulty maintaining relationships. i met my best friend in ninth grade whom i became very close with very quick, and we had an amazing friendship for like two years. it wasn't until id say mid sophomore year that i started feeling uncomfortable around her. like i didn't want to be near her and that she was this bad person that just annoyed the crap out of me. why? i don't know. i told her i needed a break from our friendship with absolutely no explanation as i didn't have one. we stopped being friends for a few months and when we were good again, she told me she wasn't a virgin anymore and has casual sex regularly. this disgusted me and made her even more repulsive than ever, mostly that we (at the time) were still so young and naive and i believe i didn't look at her the same. i still don't. i could never explain the feelings i had and i did this to so many other people. i would get uncomfortable randomly and look at them like such awful people. ive ruined so many friendships this way. i hate myself so much for it but i only see things in one way or the other, and i can't control my emotions about them either. 

i also consistently romantizice my life. this was quite a common thing for me for a long time but now its getting worse and i don't know what to do. its the same process every time too. i get attached to someone, think they are in love with me or that I'm this sex magnet that they cant resist, realize that they aren't actually interested as much as i thought, get sad and move on. but it happens so so often and i feel now that every aspect of my existence is evolved around being better than other people, being smarter, funnier, more attractive, etc etc etc... but i am not. i hate myself so fucking much. i constantly compare my looks and personality to other people. i find myself wanted to replicate others mannerism or humour or things like that. its my way of living in a reality that doesn't exist and never will. god it makes me so upset. but i cant stop. i want so badly to be someone i am not but i know i will never get there. same with the way i view my relationships. i want to love everyone for who they are but i just cannot stop judging people for even the smallest things. I'm ruining my life. 

those are probably the two main things that have been bothering me for a long time. I'm going to bring it up to my psychiatrist but after mild research, this is where i am for right now. thanks for reading if u made it to the end. any questions or concerns are welcomed.",2
203,False toughness as narcissistic defence mechanism,zycwrzyc,65,mseopm,2021-04-16 22:58:00,14,"Insight from therapy, maybe someone will find it helpful.

I wrote two posts in here about feeling amoral and getting almost sociopathic thoughts 6 months into therapy. Long story short, I got a surprising high score on psychopathy test recently and my therapist suggested that it's because I'm experiencing a push back from opening up to vulnerability.

I am so threatened by my capacity to be vulnerable in relationships with people that I subconsciously convinced myself I'm a cold-hearted, detached sociopath cosplaying a functioning member of society. Everything to have a reason NOT to be vulnerable. 

It's fucked up how I keep putting out new defence mechanisms because I'm afraid of being hurt.

I don't want to be a leader, or have control over others or be be treated like a king or anything, or dominate I don't think I'm better than anyone, I don't bully others or tear people down, I'm really  not competitive, I really just want to live my life in piece with as little inconvenience as possible. I don't like things getting in the way of something I want. 

I don't like someone trying to control me and restrict my freedom, or not respecting my boundarys. I believe, whats mine is mine, your stuff is your stuff aslong as you're not bothering me personally you can run around nude for all I care. I don't have an issue keeping a job or anything, work is work but my personal life is mine. I had an ex girlfriend who tried tooth and nail to get me to convert tooth and nail to get me to go vegan. She started pushing on it to the point where she got upset when I said no. That got me annoyed because in my mind I'm like why can't you just accept my response? You're making a simple situation very difficult for no reason, be vegan yourself but thats not what I want to do. I'd never expect a girl to change anything that she does  just to date me so I do expect the same consideration. 


I do have had a difficult time maintaining a relationship due to me losing interest and it always felt like a chore doing the whole boyfriend thing so I avoid romantic relationships but still have casual sex every now and then. I do know I could never have kids, that whole parenting thing is something I know for a fact I'm not selfless enough for. I politely  avoid  friendships with clingy or emotionally needy or emotionally intense  individuals. I can say if I'm reaaallly pushed I can be very mean and down right vile, I've only had a  small few people get me to that point. One example was two guys years ago tried to mug me by jumping me as I was heading to a subway station. I'm not going to say I'm tough, but I've been blessed with natural decent physical strength and I was able to get the best of them and I took things waaaaaaay to far and someone called the police and I got arrested but charges dropped when I agreed to anger management, I did feel proud of myself after that incident I'll admit. I was enraged because I couldnt see myself as a victim of a crime. 


Other than that I'm usually pretty neutral and indifferent to most things and other usually describe me as chill. I don't get upset if a girl rejected me, I don't get mad if I'm playing a video game with a friend and they keep getting us killed lol, I don't get bothered if my order is incorrect at restaurants I'll just politely ask it to be corrected and I don't lolk down on others for there life choices. I don't want anything from anyone.  Are these narc traits?",7
206,Do I have NPD?,JawsJew,9,cu19n3,2019-08-22 18:12:49,12,"First, for some background/context: I'm a late-20s gay male from the US.

Since I was young, I've always loved and needed attention. As a young child, I was unusually precocious and outgoing with adults and would go up and talk to random strangers. I was a favorite of a couple of teachers and I believe I was complimented a lot about how smart, charming, and cute I was.

I've always DESPISED being ignored and/or invisible. As a kid, if someone ignored me, I'd literally pester them until they responded. And now, if someone doesn't respond to my text in a short amount of time, I'll get huffy, even texting them multiple times to pester them, sometimes angrily.

Since I was at least \~ 12-13, I've also always felt this deep-seated need to be perfect and since I'm not, I'm constantly at war with myself and with the world, because it doesn't recognize my ""perfection."" This need for perfection feels like it's coming from some internal parent-like force. If I'm not perfect, my superego tells me that I'm worthless, unlovable, and thus I hate myself. I can only ""refuel"" the feeling of perfection by getting attention and admiration by strangers, which my mind then conveniently warps and twists to fit that image of perfection. (Sam Vaknin's articles on this really resonate with me.)

As a teenager, I had virtually no real-world social life whatsoever for about 4-6 years. My substitute was spending copious and excessive amounts of time on Internet forums for various topics, trying to seem like the smartest person there, getting frustrated and even enraged when I wasn't. I eventually grew to be universally hated on one forum because of my know-it-all and confrontational attitude.

And when my friend told me his IQ was higher than mine at 19, I went into what I feel was a narcissistic rage. I was so uncontrollably angry. But I guess I mostly got over it, at least enough to still had fun on the vacation we went on together.

And therein lies the rub. That need for attention for my intellect have mutated into this insatiable need for attention for my looks, since I've realized I'm good looking in the past 8 years.

I walk down the street of the busy city I live in, expecting attention and getting angry when heads don't turn on the sidewalk. At some level, I realize I'm not a super model. I would peg myself at about a 8.5/10 face-wise (maybe less if you count my acne). I think that's realistic as I am very good looking, but not gorgeous or a movie star.

And that angers, upsets, disappoints, and, hell, panics me to no end, because it means I've FAILED at perfection.

I'll never get the level of attention and admiration as that kind of person. And when I see someone more attractive than me, I often fly into a narcissistic rage.

When I look at myself in the mirror, I'm usually disappointed, continuing to compare myself to the likes of George Clooney, Brad Pitt, and others and inevitably falling short.

I also constantly self-sabotage. I have a business that I could have grown into something fairly big, but instead I'm still a one-man band and am in a lot of debt and can barely afford to live. I just ""skate by"" and am a classic ""failure to launch.""

Finally, I've never ejaculated with another human being, so perhaps I'm technically a virgin, at almost 30, and that's also incredibly depressing. I have severe ED whenever I try to hook up, because I'm so afraid of intimacy/people/judgment.

**So, to sum up, and some other traits:**

\- An insatiable need for attaining perfection and worthlessness when I inevitably don't feel and am not perfect

\- An insatiable need for attention and admiration in public as a reminder that I'm ""beautiful"" and fulfill my delusional fantasy of perfection

\- Defective/nonexistent romantic relationships and sex life. I live in my fantasy world of what could be, refusing and being too scared to disrupt or shatter my fantasy of perfection by actually risking real-world appraisals of my looks and worthiness and the associated rejection

\- Narcissistic rage when I'm told I'm not as handsome (in particular), smart, etc. as I wish I were

\- Constant self-sabotage, not attaining anywhere near my potential, doing things that intentionally and sadistically jeopardize myself--e.g. not going to events that could get me more clients, saying mean, rude, or poorly worded things or giving off bad energy to potential romantic prospects...countless more examples

Do I have NPD?

Thank you for reading this long wall of text.",9
207,Therapist Thinks I'm Not A Narc.,wallsinhalls,10,bdmvig,2019-04-15 23:30:41,21,"My therapist is adamant that I'm not a narcissist.  But I can't accept the diagnosis.  I feel that even if I wanted to be honest with him, or with anyone, about who I am and what I want and *why* I want, I couldn't do it.  Because I don't know who I am.  

I've been watching videos of me as a kid and its plain as day that my dad couldn't let me be myself.  He hated real expression and did his best to stifle me, which makes sense because he has no real expression(besides anger).  So here I am, over a quarter-century old and I'm angry and bitter at the world.  I was never allowed to discover myself or be ok with my emotions.  And now, because of shitty parenting, I've become my dad - a hateful, empty vessel unable to love and unable to let go.  

I'm very upset because he emotionally abused me as a kid and he stunted me.  This amount of damage had to be intentional.  To this day he still feels good by putting me down.  He knows my weaknesses.  He always has.  That's why it was easy for him to program me for failure.  And its too late.  Looking back, even at age two, I see that I didn't feel safe being myself.  My whole personality is built on hiding from the shame I experienced and the fear from being unwanted and unseen.  

I don't think that therapy will help me, unless i lie to my therapist about my progress.  I get my self esteem from being someone i'm not, and its been that way for so long, I don't know who I am.",10
208,A little rant,YeezusIsTheNewJesus,2,oaqklj,2021-06-30 05:34:43,7,I have to be the most scariest and damaging person in peoples sights. I want people to fear me and revere me. And I need a disorder that yells “run the fuck away”. I’ll also need a disorder to make people feel bad for me and act all sympathetic so I get special treatment from others. A disorder to “mask” my behavior. Perfect. I must be superior. I must be special. I must have quirks. I must be the “tougher”individual out of all the groups. I must be #1. I will not allow myself to be normal. If someone says they’ve been through a lot of pain I will say I’ve been through more to convey my superiority by handling more pain than him.

209,"I think I might be a narcissist, and I don't know how to cope with it.",fatcatalert,9,dhc9di,2019-10-13 15:48:15,6,"At least it wouldn't surprise me. I was raised by narcissistic parents and I'm aware that sometimes I exhibit narcissistic traits. I've been told by professionals too, but I never received the diagnosis. Frankly, I rejected the idea fully at the time, and relied on my borderline diagnosis to point out that a lot of these traits overlap.

Recently, I'm not so sure of that anymore. I've been getting ""worse"" progressively over the years. I didn't notice it at the time but looking back, these innermost feelings which were then labelled as narcissistic are coming to the surface more and more.

I like to still think of myself as a good person, but I don't really do anyone any favors out of the goodness of my heart. How they react matters. Whether they see me as a good and selfless person after my helping them matters, and if they don't I feel burnt and angry. And I'm angry most of the time, really. I don't feel hurt a lot because I get pissed off, I can't bear when people disagree with me both when I think I'm right (I wouldn't usually say anything if I think I'm not right anyway), but especially when someone tries to prove me wrong. That doesn't mean I am wrong, or I guess even right, but it offends me when people do it. I feel like they're idiots who don't understand what I'm saying, and that that's why they argue against me. If they understood what I say, they wouldn't argue, they'd agree! But they don't.

I would say I'm pretty intelligent, but not the smartest. It's mostly because I don't know about a lot of things, but my understanding of things is pretty good. I wouldn't say I'm the most attractive person, but I still am attractive, and I feel like I'm more attractive than a vast majority of people. I'm very judgmental of people's looks, but who does want to associate with people who repulse you? Isn't it normal to avoid the people we find disgusting on either a superficial level or on that of personality?

But most of all, I'm feeling empty. My life is at a low point right now and I don't feel I have any other pleasure or purpose than to jack off until even that doesn't feel good anymore, and then get horny again 20 minutes later and repeat this. I'm finding myself attracted to the most sloppy and disgusting material out there, and I hate to admit it but I have several paraphilia which I'm not going to go into as it's quite embarrassing. I never act it out but it turns me on to no end and fantasising about it seems to be one of the only ways to cum. I feel a bit disgusted with myself afterwards. But it's not stopping me from going back to that fantasy. In fact, being so disgusted makes it feel so good. It's happened to me and I love being able to be the aggressor instead of the victim in my fantasy, it makes me feel powerful again.

Power is not usually important in my life otherwise though. To some extend I do manipulate people and I do want to exploit them, but I would never do it directly. I don't like the stigma of being that type of person, it means that I'm not a good person, but I feel ecstatic when others give me things for free or praise me anyway. On the outside I feel the need to be humble and reject those things, but on the inside it makes me feel so much better even if it's just momentarily.

And I need that. I need something to fill this emptiness with. I want people to acknowledge me and my strength because right now I can't see it in myself. With this fucking awful event in my life, I've lost the ability to feel proud on my own and I feel like I'm withering away because nothing and no one can make me feel better. Not even myself. I don't have the motivation to improve myself because it's unfair that help isn't being given to me. I deserve it, and I want it, but somehow my current condition is not enough. It pisses me off and it feeds the void in my chest at the same time. If I could fuck the void, would it feel better? Would I be able to feel for myself again and maybe even for others?

I'm getting quite off topic there but my point is that I know I have narcissistic tendencies. I have so much resentment in me and I'm aware that a lot of my thoughts and the ways I regard other people are fucked up. On the one hand, I want to get help so that I can end this and be my best self instead of getting in my own way like that. 

On the other, if I got diagnosed with NPD I don't think I'd be able to accept it. I feel angry thinking about it, I feel upset about someone else having to tell me this and it makes me feel powerless. Will the professionals still believe me when I tell them about my experience? Will they assume I'm lying? Will they finally call out my power struggles with them when I think they're doing a shit job and would I be happy about that or would I get upset?

And finally.. how would I even approach this with a therapist or psychiatrist? After all narcissists aren't supposed to be self aware anyway. If I say I feel I might have NPD and would like to get assessed properly, will they automatically conclude that I'm not? I want honesty, but I also don't want the diagnosis. If I did get it, how would I handle it? How have you handled it if you've gotten it? Does anyone understand how I feel here?",9

211,Does my issue in dating sound related to me having narcissism ?,justonething6,2,meigiy,2021-03-27 17:32:51,7,"I have a narcissist mom so I was curious. I can be delusional in dating and obsessive. I struggle moving on bc if I move on I can’t be with the person who I’m obsessed with. I feel like my narrative of what happens in relationships is often wrong. Warning: I’m indecisive, afraid of ppl, and bad at understanding my feelings in the moment 

I met a guy the first week of college and we really hit it off and talked for hours. I met him because my friend was flirting with his friend so she brought me to their room. He walked me home and I was nervous to be with a guy alone so I kinda wanted him to leave. He tried to kiss me on the way out but I was really nervous and panicked and kinda kept saying how I couldn’t walk him out of my room and rushing him out. He got annoyed and kinda had a snarky tone and annoyed look in his eyes. I’m really hyper vigilant and when people treat me like this I kinda freeze. I remember just thinking that he must hate me and being afraid that he’d hate me for not kissing him. I hadn’t taken time to think abt my feelings for him. The next day my friend brought me back over to his room- obviously he didn’t hate me bc he invited us back. But I didn’t take the time to think and when we went over I still had a feeling he hated me and was standing in the room soooo awkwardly waiting to see if he’d say anything to me. He got annoyed and had what felt to me like a super aggressive tone and told me I could sit down. He was giving me an annoyed look bc I rlly didn’t talk to him at all and was panicked. We hung out a few days and things were super awkward between us and than after that I just remember thinking about him when I was alone. I remember thinking “wow he’s the kindest most gentle men like guy I’ve ever met and we click so well. I need to be with him” even tho things were already off between us. He invited me to hangout the next day but I didn’t reply until the next day bc I have so much social anxiety and a fear of boring ppl if I’m w them alone. I also didn’t want to hook up w him bc I didn’t know him well and I have a fear of saying no to someone so I’d rather just not hangout w them at all then disappoint them when I’m with them bc I’d feel forced. So I basically said no and than we stopped talking. A week later I was still obsessed w him and thinking abt him all the time. I feel like when this happens my brain assumes the guy is with me and thinks abt me a lot too and thinks even a Snapchat from them means something. So I drunk snapcatted him to hangout and we did with my friend and his friend. I was kinda trying to get closer to him but he seemed a little over it. My friend was annoyed at his friend so we left right away.  He snap chatted me flirty stuff abt how he was sad and wanted me to come back but I was nervous and texted him an hour later saying I was busy. Him and I lost contact but in my head I like thought abt him everyday and thought he felt the same. But nope obviously.

A month later I ran into him on campus twice coincidentally. I’d seen him before this at parties but been so nervous I could barley say hi bc i was obsessed w him. But after running into him him and I still snap chatted and it kinda seems like he noticed me more by his facial expressions. I feel like my brain is stupid and in the moment I think how we sparked a special connection but we just noticed eachother. At a party I was drunk and looking at Him a lot. He eventually came up to me at the end of the night and seemed nervous and waited until I said hi to him to say hi. But he seemed nervous and quickly talked to someone next to me but just seemed kinda panicked. My friend told me the next day that he asked abt me four times and said he thought I was so pretty. The next time I saw him was at a party and I think he was talking to a girl he had a thing with a lot. But I went up to him and was really drunk and flirting w him a lot but I have adhd and ran away randomly than came back.

Than a week later I ubered home from a a party and the girl next to me was snap chatting him and I was annoyed by it and in a bad mood. I remember I flicked him off twice on Snapchat. I obviously shouldn’t have been annoyed by it. I think at the time I sped up r relationship a lot in r head and wondered why he hadn’t kissed me. But after than I saw him at a party that night and was sober. I think a part of me was annoyed by the Snapchat I saw & another part of me was nervous to talk to him sober.. so I quickly gave him a dirty look when I saw him walk up behind me. His face looked shocked and frozen. Than later than night when I walked outside at that party my friend screamed my name and stuff and he kinda appeared right next to me after she left. Kinda seems like he did it on purpose. When I saw him at this point I was a little tipsy. He looked really nervous when I looked at him but I was drunk and gave him a huge hug and was talking to him. After he put his hands on my lower back and walked me somewhere but already had an Uber home. 

The next week I saw him at a party and my friend told him he should take me to his date party (this was before I was at the party). She said he was blushing and asking if I’d really wanna go and really say yes. She said he was excited and said he would and said he through I was so hot. He was flirting w me but if I something was off. When I went up to him he looked at me and his whole facial expression didn’t move at allllll- Mby he was drunk ish but in the moment I was shocked.. his flirting was rlly off. He talked to my friend normal but when he talked to me he was looking at his feet and swinging his legs and being kinda boring. It was like he was acting a mix of totally intimate rested and nervous. My friend was saying to grind on him and stuff bc she was drunk and I think he saw I was nervous in my eyes. He had his hands holding my hips and was facing me & he told me to come w him .. probs bc I was panicking. In the other room hkm and I were flirting. I purposefully said something “funny/crazy” and how I go out every night so he would say “ur crazy” back. It was just the expected response bc of my joke. But his eyes like widened so much when he said it and he used a dreamy voice .. I can’t explain this but it felt so forced it scared me and I like ran to my friend. It just felt fake so i through he was using me and faking his feelings. Him and I were rlly awk this night and just kept hugging and saying a little something than walking away. I was talking to my friend and saw him & his friend both had their arms crossed and eyebrows raised while staring at me w a smirk. For some reason I kinda do things that I tell myself not to- I told myself not to flirt back but I made a flirty face back so he would come over. But when he did he used this full monotones voice and it seemed like he was being that way on purpose. My friend asked me to go w her to find someone so I said yes and left him which probably obviously hurt his ego. But like thirty minutes later he sent me a selfie w a girl in his room. Idk if he meant it to hurt my feelings or remembers doing it but I was rly hurt and drunk and said a bunch of being stuff abt how I hated him.

The next day I went out and saw him at an after party. My friend hadn’t talked to me abt what happened and when we talked I didn’t say much and the guy. So she told hjm to take me to his formal. She told me he was mad and said “no I have a date”. The thing is he did have a date and it was the girl he’d been talking to for months. She told him to go talk to me so he did but I looked annoyed. He started to turn away but his friend called him over and him and I ended up talking. To him it was a joke argument I think but I was so frustrated. He angrily asked why I was mad and I didn’t say so he said I was just mad he wouldn’t take me to his formal. I said how I didn’t care and blah blah blah he kept trying to prove I did and I told him to leave so he walked over to the other girl. On the way home my friends and I ubered w his friend and i drunk ranted abt him for an hour.

I flicked him off on sc the next day and he asked why and I said he was rude when he said I was mad he wouldn’t take me. He said he never said it (lied). But he complained abt my friend for an hour and the convo went no where. I told him I never wanted to go w him and it was just my friend and he said that’s what he thought. And than I said I was annoyed bc he acts like he doesn’t like me (he asked why). I honestly only said this bc  I wanted him to say he liked me but he just kept insisting he definitely  didn’t dislike me. I ran into him the next day and my social anxiety made it seem like I was being sassy and he was kinda joking and flirting w me.

Over the next few days my friend would tell me abt how she heard abt his date to his formal. I couldn’t even speak when I heard abt this and it hurt me physically. I ended up drunk texting him a bunch of reallyyyyyyyt mean insults for hours while also randomly telling him he can trust me and be honest with me. Basically I tried getting him to say he liked me bc than I knew we could be together.  But I was just being verbally super abusive. This happened twice. I remember being drunk and soooooooooo angry bc I felt like I needed him to like me and needed him to say it. I was very drunk and very out of control.

I still couldn’t forget abt him and even next semester he had begun dating the girl and I couldn’t. I saw him at a party and I didn’t even mean to do this but each time he’d walk by me I’d flick him off. He walked by me a ton and went up to my friend. My friend said it seemed like he liked me but I think he was worried I’d talk to his gf. He even ran up to her and fake flirted w her when I was standing in her area. He also nervously kept looking at me from the corner of his eye and when I looked over he fully spun away from her to me but I was mad and used a harsh tone than turned away. He was standing there and than ran away and didn’t talk to his gf again. I’m guessing he was standing their listening to me say he was annoying to my friends but I genuinely think ininterprate body language wrong at times bc my brain assumed he stood their frozen and upset than ran away. The next time I saw him  at a party he was glaring at me than came up and glared in my face a few time and wouldn’t leave. He would get in between my convos e his friends who I have mutual friends w. He came up to me later and asked how I’ve been in a reallyyyy cold tone. Than he looked me up and down. Than he angrily scrunched his face at me. Than he reached out at rubbed my shoulder in a petty way & turned around and walked away. This got me so mad bc the next time I saw him he didn’t pay attention to me and I felt like hell and was super mean to him. I was insanely mean and asking him if he was trying to hurt me and telling him he needed to tell me what I did to him",2
212,i think my boyfriend might be an narcissist,fuckoffidontloveu,1,p5f1ap,2021-08-16 12:26:20,26,"
hello, im new here, i suffer from borderline personality disorder and adhd and social anxiety.

I have been with this guy for 1 year and 6 months. Our relationship has been toxic, but its not only him. The reason i came here today to this page is because im very curious.. and i have been reading alot about narcissist and i think my boyfriend might have it..

What really concerned me was, that he is an exstreme angry and hostile person, everything sets him off.. hes always defensive, always trying to put the blame on me, and its super anoying. He has admit he has manipulated me in the past, and uses it to trick people into giving him what he want. 
He cant have any critizm or have anyone blame him for his actions.
He said to me he lack empathy, he also said to me he would not care if anyone in my family died, he would not feel anything. 
And his sister got raped ofc he cared for her a little bit, but wayyyyyy less than other people might would have.. 
He knows the best way to hurt me and uses it as his advantage.. he is obsessed with revenge.. he always uses sentences as «Why care for other people? Its only yourself that is important, the only person you can trust is yourself. 
He also is obsessed with what other people do, how they dressed,  he gave me an example, he would gas light someone for saying they were good at skating and then he were the «Big bully « who embarrased him infront of the hole school. He always tries to be better than people, he always think hes so much better than everyone Else, but in reality he has a low confidence.
He has also been reading alot about narcissism.. 
he’s also an exstremly jealous boy, but can people with narcissism feel jealousy?
And i dont really feel like he feel guilty for hurting me..because he never stops! 
One time i ended up hamring myself because of an argument we had,and he did not care at all.. he said i deserved it.. (just because i posted a picture ofmyself) he tought my boobs were showing too much so what i got hurt by him did not matter a single thing..  if i caught him dong  something that hurted me, he wil bring up old things from the past as his defense, he would automaticly try to frame me as the bad guy, just to Get away so he dont Get framed.  he have cried infront of me, but that does not happend often, (because i hurted him)  he has feelings for himself but does not seem like he cares about what anyone Else feels..  (he has also adhd and bipolar 2) 
Can anyone with narcissism write what they think about my boyfriend? Do you suspect he has it too?",1

And I do something to upset that person, but in my eyes it’s justified by all my good deeds.

214,Am I A Narcissist?,Sad-Ad-371,8,l1uv24,2021-01-21 09:06:30,6,"
Before I begin to share I would like to preface that I have NOT been diagnosed with NPD nor have ever visited a therapist. 

From the beginning of the start of my own self-awareness - around junior high - I’ve felt as though I am intellectually superior to most others. I am very quick to consider myself a genius, going as far as taking online IQ tests to affirm my self identification. Adding to this superiority is the fact that I’ve had straight A’s my entire life. I also attribute most of my academic setbacks, such as not being in the highest possible classes, due to the stupidity of the rest of my class which forced me to slow down to their level and not be as prepared for high school classes. 

Around this time as well, many people have called me quick to anger and scary at times. They would label me with “anger issues” but every time I look at the events, they were caused by them provoking me.

For the majority of my life I’ve also been pretty mellow. I used to help people with some things but now have gotten to the point where I am just extremely callous and just do not care anymore. Especially since during Covid I’ve only held consistent communication with around 10 people. I am also a very introverted person. I tend not to allow everyone into my life, which makes me feel as though I project a false persona of myself. 

I also exhibit instances of a lack of empathy as well. As I’ve mentioned in the last paragraph, I’ve been recently very callous. But also I have abused others physically and other means I wish not to say. I’m aware of the immorality of such but I don’t know, I guess I just don’t care much. I do feel guilt at times but I just usually downplay it and forget about what I had done. I feel, as well, that I can harm others without much care either, but what fruit would such an action bear? I’m not a sadist so I don’t go out of my way to harm others, however, sometimes I may as a result of frustration with that person. Again, when that does happen, I don’t much care as long as they don’t pull that stupid ass stunt again. Adding to the anger I sometimes feel, I generally get super annoyed at my mother when she tells me to do tasks. Even menial tasks such as getting her water is met with a stark remark and “why can’t you do that yourself?” I sometimes think about this and how I make her feel sometimes because I am quick to yell, but no matter how much I’ve thought it over I am back to becoming upset at her for even speaking to me.

I also feel like I don’t have the ability to love, romantic or familial. I’ve never told my mom I loved her. Don’t really feel a need too either as it is just a word. I DO lust for women, but once I am in a relationship I get bored fairly quickly and wish to move on. However, I do feel as though I have actual love for someone as I am usually infatuated with people I cannot have, but I feel that most others do as well. But I do know that no matter how much and however long I am infatuated, it  would quickly amount to nothing once we are together. I have been labeled a heartbreaker and player by multiple people. I sometimes laugh about what I did and tell myself that they weren’t up to par for my own standards, mostly as justification.

My father has been diagnosed by a therapist as having narcissistic rage, so I will assume that he has NPD in addition. He has been somewhat absent in my life, BUT I do get along with him very well. I used to be extremely fearful of his bouts of anger, which were very bad at times, and now I haven’t angered him for many years now. I generally talk to him about topics that he enjoys himself as well, as he gets visibly upset and annoyed with constant questions or continuing a topic not of his interest. 

For the more notable aspects of narcissism, I do also exhibit those as well. I remember writing in my journal that I wished for the power of Napoleon Bonaparte. I considered myself as his reincarnation because of his dramatic rise to power. It is quite amazing I may add as he had total control over the majority of Europe. And I also think about my future being very successful. I often fantasize of being a billionaire and being wildly famous. I’ve also thought of myself as deserving of a woman such as Kylie Jenner, simply for her status and beauty. I would say that I am above average attractive. I am coy as well sometimes with others and downplay my highest achievements as if they weren’t that great and as if I could do better. I am quiet shy though and don’t have many close friends, less than 5. And I am prone to showing a high ego or confidence sometimes.

This may have been longer than I have intended to write, but I just wanted to share how I feel and not be so closeted mentally about my rationale and feelings. I just don’t want to think I’m such a bad person. And I know I may have listed things that fit every check, but it was not my intention to do so; simply just to share. I am not trying to list anything to prove that I have this disorder or anything, I could care less about having to prove this type of thing to people. I feel like I haven’t harmed anyone, but am I severely narcissistic or have NPD at all?? Am I fucked up? I’m happy to answer any questions or hear any comments.",8
215,Low Frustration Tolerance (LFT),ImperiousAnarchist,3,pbjrpl,2021-08-25 20:32:38,7,"I'm going to assume that many of the narcissists here struggle with being able to tolerate frustration. I did some searching using Google, but I didn't find much on LFT and narcissism. I'm not sure what the academic community has to say about this conceptual link.  


For myself, I will say that my tolerance for frustration was much higher before I dropped out of law school. I studied for so long to get a great score on the LSAT and get into a selective law school despite literally trying to kill myself for not getting a higher score on my third attempt. I also studied hard in law school despite not getting high grades. I was able to put up with not getting gratification all for the goal of landing a job at a major law firm.  


In university, I performed better on exams and papers after my advisors warned me that I may be ejected from the scholarship program I was accepted to. Despite dealing with depression, I was able to complete my senior thesis and graduate successfully from that program. I earned mediocre grades on my papers freshman and sophomore years (mediocre for me and for my scholarship program is anything less than an A-. If you're happy with Bs and lower, then I have nothing to say to you lol) but put in effort to pump out stellar papers. I even did well in my quantitative and math courses.  


Now...I get pissed off when I lose a game of blitz chess—especially when I feel like my performance was trash. I've broken shit in my apartment. I went to get a second bachelor's degree in computer science after law school. I took college-level chemistry, physics, calculus 1, and calculus 2. I did well in those classes. Yet I stopped going to class in the second semester as I got distracted by political activism—which I thought was my path to greatness (the joke was on me, fellow narcs). 

I get bored and discouraged easily. I've moved from project to project, life plan to life plan as I can't seem to stick to one thing. I've lost my ability to stick to things and follow through. The undertaking stickiness is at a low level. My persistence is dormant.

Is it because I feel like a loser after dropping out of law school? That my ego is even more fragile than usual so anything that might challenge that fragile sense of self I will avoid? Fuck knows. All I know is that something has to change. I can't continue living on like this. I have to homebrew some internal source of self-esteem that will tide me over in the face of a challenge. 

I see the way forward conceptually, but how do I actually get to that goalpost?",3

For instance if I was to tell someone something that was true in regards to myself and they questioned it. It ignites a rage for that person. I don't express it as I know its outwith my normal mindset. But I get stuck with the anger and the poor mindet on the world for hours after that. Sometimes just have to accept that's it for the day.",14

218,Turns out I have Autism,adriaticwaves,51,oedvy7,2021-07-05 19:01:10,26,"I just wanted to apologize and also say this in case it helps someone else. 

I really thought I had NPD. I was willing to go fully into whatever admissions and healing was necessary. But, I was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder.

As a woman, I guess it was missed. It should have been obvious, but it wasn't. Probably because I had a couple of key social role models who were very social. (And I spent years where nearly all my free time was dedicated to psychology).

Why I thought it was NPD: 

My masking was a huge source of my self-centered behaviors. It was so draining for me. Plus the autism itself makes it difficult to notice and attend to what others find important (grooming, social courtesies, etc.). 

It didn't make sense to me why people didn't act in certain ways until I read about it and started meeting other people like me. When their behavior was a mirror, I finally started getting it about how others see me. 

I never blame others and always take things way too personally and try to be hypermoral. This sometimes upsets neurotypicals around me and they try to make me feel guilty or selfish. 

So if you're resonating with the covert type and don't do well socially at all and have other problems related to employment and social acceptance, maybe check into autism just in case?",51
219,Is anyone here also inflicted with a sadistic leaning personality?,DeathNote55,14,mt80yp,2021-04-18 07:05:41,27,"As far back as I can remember .. pretty much my first memory in fact, I’ve been obsessed with themes of pain and vulnerability. Those were and still are the things that make me happiest, particularly if it’s shit like kids being tortured/ill/vomiting/dissected/whatever the fuck else on a daily basis since I was 5/6. 

Regarding how I treat people, my sense of humor is mostly the type where  I poke fun at others, force people to become uncomfortable or terrified with shock content, or make them outraged by prompting reactions like that on purpose by showing them vicious crimes or similar acts that happen. I’m also obsessed with punishing people who I deem were “out of line” and derive a lot of pleasure from their Pain when I feel justice has been served, to the point where I bit or otherwise abused children (when I was younger) or even enjoyed snuff films in a sexual way because I felt they deserved it. It’s weird. I was like an out of control prison guard.

My happiest fantasies are ones where I use people or hurt or make them uncomfortable, or at the very least, they feel nothing or plain reluctance while I enjoy myself. It’s like something inside my brain refuses to let me reach normal levels of happiness when someone else is happy with me.

I don’t feel bad about it because I don’t feel shame at all ever, but the weird thing is why? Is this a narcissism thing? Why would I be somehow uncomfortable with others being happy? It makes no sense... happiness isn’t a finite thing, so why will my brain refuse to share it? It’s ultimately led to me having a more sadistic type personality. 

Thoughts ? Connections to narcissism?",14

223,"Treachery and Treason, just venting, support and advice more than welcome",DeliriumTremens93,4,pl2jr8,2021-09-09 17:36:06,2,"I'm 28f, officially diagnosed with NPD +BPD traits when I was 19.  I've been nearly two years sober and clean in  NA and AA. They say though, that addicts, though recovered, remain very sick (emotionally) sick people. So I was dating some guy who's also in NA,  who I'll call A, but it's pretty obvious that he was stringing me along. I'd go months without hearing anything from him. This really pissed me off, and I people told me he'd been hitting on lots of other women. Someone even saw him on a dating app and sent that to me. I knew though, that the guy was unemployed and told a few 'friends' while complaining about him. 

  Then I met a 'friend' who I'll call X,  told me a lot of nasty stuff about other people in the fellowship. Real confidential information that simply shouldn't be shared with others. She told me one person worked as a hooker, I'll call this person Y. This was true, I already knew that, but I was shocked about the fact that X would tell me such confidential information. Based on X's stories, it turned out she had a problem with nearly everyone in the fellowship. I was then very stupid, and yes, this is definitely my fault, but I told Y that X had told me that Y worked as a hooker. Y understandably called X furiously, but X must have turned the tables, because Y now no longer wants to talk to me. 

X took revenge on me and called a few people, including that guy I was 'dating' called A. She told him that I'd told lots of people that he's at home, unemployed, and that he's been hitting on all women in NA. The first part is correct, I did indeed tell other people that, but the latter is false, other people actually informed me about him hitting on other women.  He didn't doubt X's story at all and now he's blocked me on WhatsApp. I called him with my landline, and he basically believes that I'm completely insane. 

Sounds a bit like multiple PD's doing crazy, lol. I just wonder what I need to do at this point. Wonder if I should leave 12 step programs altogether because this isn't the first time something like this has happened.",4
224,Other people’s feelings,No_School8440,8,pbslyw,2021-08-26 04:56:48,3,"I’m pretty sure I identify with most of the covert narcissism traits. It’s weird… I see you all tearing each other apart trying to establish that you are better, smarter, more beautiful, or whatever trait gets you the most attention and I get it. 

Here’s the thing, I’m not sure I can relate to most people. But when I see you dismiss others, minimize their achievements, status, or just plain tell them they’re wrong, and brag, I can relate to that. 

Someone else here said they felt anger if someone found joy in something they didn’t. I hate game of thrones and I get so irritated when others enjoy it. It’s almost like how can they pay attention to a show that’s so obviously uncreative and boring? The only interesting / funny scenes to me were the torture scenes and some of the eye candy. (But I don’t think I have ASPD, the scenes were just interesting).

I have another problem though, when I hurt people, it’s usually pretty indirect. At times I didn’t even realize I was hurting people, I thought I was just righting perceived wrongs and making a point.

And with that self-awareness, I think I’ve been trying to be good and not be retributive. I also have an auditory processing disorder - I can hear perfectly, but if there’s a lot of noise, I have trouble understanding people, so I usually tune them out. But I also just don’t care very much and it’s exhausting to nod and smile and help people feel validated. Maybe it’s not so much that I don’t care but that my primary motivation is getting attention.

Does anyone else feel like it takes a lot of energy to be good to others and try to understand how they feel? Or is that normal?",8
225,Would a narcissist think this way?,Toosieslidez,4,prhwur,2021-09-19 22:23:13,3,"When I am the slightest bit rude or even just monotone in a conversation, I will think I’m not showing an interest in what the other person is saying therefore I must be a narcissist and I need to do better.

When I don’t answer someone for hours, I will think that’s narcissistic.

When I think about moving on from a relationship and cutting contact, I tell myself I need to be more empathetic and worry more about how the other person will feel.

When I’m upset at something, I tell myself I’m being narcissistic and need to calm down.

There are 100 more examples I could give but here are some… would a narcissist think and be aware like this without anyone pointing it out? Thank you",4
226,Non NPD looking for advice,Sure-Butterscotch-35,2,q1p7vp,2021-10-05 06:43:20,2,"Or I might be NPD I don’t really know, I’ve been told a million times I’m not but some of my behavior is kinda sus.

But let’s ignore the label, cuz usually I’m just worried about that… this is my main concern with myself.

I do things to boost my ego. I was not conscious of this for a long time, but I believe that’s what I’m doing. For example I will get the urge to tell the girl I love how much I love her, how special is, how sorry I am that she’s been through everything she has, how I’m here for her and all this shit but when I don’t get the response I want such as an I love you back or a similar response, or even her opening up to me about things bothering her I feel dissapointed. Not in her, not angry with her, just more of a sad feeling. I do not want to do this, and I also feel like part of it is controlling… to get her to rely on me or something. But, that’s not my thought process when it’s happening it feels really genuine like I mean everything I’m saying… and in fact I do mean everything I’m saying and I get very emotional when I am saying the things I am. I genuinely feel it, and sometimes I even cry thinking about her and her past. But again there’s all the things I listed above, and part of me feels like if I’m not affectionate for even a day… they will stop loving me or it’s like I lose control. So, how do I stop this. Well, tip 1 is to just stop but I also do like reassuring them I care. So how do I make this more healthy and stop feeding off of it for happiness

edit: someone on another sub said I am feeling empathy, I feel like that’s not true though.",2
227,Npd causing problems,Illustrious_Add,5,prkrs8,2021-09-20 01:21:21,3,"Does anybody think that their npd doesn’t cause that many problems in their own life? I think i’m better than people, sure, but and on occasion i’ll wreck a relationship. Reason i’m asking is because i’m debating therapy and i feel like it’s not as bad as it seems. I can keep my internal thoughts superiority inside so i dont piss people off. I’m extremely good at making friends and reading people so i know how someone thinks and how my actions will make their perception of me. I just feel like if i go to therapy the therapist will be like “you’re not causing tons of problems so you’re all good”",5
228,I caught myself treating the new person I'm seeing like potential supply,lonelysothrowmeaway,21,ozzqis,2021-08-07 19:32:06,7,"I considered lovebombing her and setting up extravagant dates where I cover most expenses. Her favourite flowers, her favourite food. 

I asked for exclusivity after the first date.

I get upset she's not texting me 24/7 but I don't show it. I consider not texting her for extended periods of time and withdrawing affection. I egg her on to say things that make me happy, like saying she likes me.

I saw the term 'lovebombing' while surfing the net and the description of narcissistic supply in a romantic context made me go, ""Holy shit.""

I may not be a textbook narcissist, I don't even know if I am one covertly, but it surprised me a bit to realise what I was doing.",21
229,I'm terrified I'm a Covert Narcissist - I feel bad inside,UsedLet9343,13,o7qdji,2021-06-25 15:49:12,44,"This is going to be long, so I apologise and bare with:

I've been in and out of this dilemma for a couple of years now, but only in the last couple of weeks has this fear grown. I'm a 21 year old introverted female - been feeling there's something wrong with me for roughly 3 years now, but when I look back, it seems like I've been like this for a long while. 

I feel there's something seriously wrong with me. I feel bad inside. How I think is fucked up and isn't normal. All I think about is myself, how I come across to others - it's so messed up that the only way I know how to think is through other people's perceptions, - it's so weird - I think of myself, daydream and fantasise of myself in third person, constantly wondering what people think of me - both positively and negatively. Trying to impress or, as horrible as it is to admit, feel admired or wanted. For as long as I can remember I've thought this way - when I look back at being a little girl I was always daydreaming; dreaming up fantasies of having a boyfriend (ugh) and imagining stories of my life. (I grew up as an only child with a single mother who was/is very overprotective and has spoiled me and done a lot of things for me - so I don't know if that plays into it). Now it's how if I did a certain hobby, activity or thing it would make me look cool or fun or whatever. But it works the opposite way too - I often think so so so negatively of myself - I hate myself. I feel I have no personality, nothing to give. I feel useless and scared - I'm so beyond clumsy, scatty and forgetful and so ashamed of it all, ashamed of how I am and act. I feel I'm constantly having an identity crisis - it may sound weird but in the mornings I really struggle with what clothing I should wear - how I want to come across, if it looks nice or reflects ""me"" - but who the hell is me?? 

I've been in a couple of relationships now - my first relationship lasted 2.5 years (i was 18 when it started) and he didn't believe in labels - he hated the idea of having a ""girlfriend"" and never referred to me as his, just a good friend even though we were exclusive - he never showed PDA (which is fair enough cause it makes some people uncomfortable) but it made me think he wanted to come across as single. I truly never ever felt good enough for him and he knew this as I would talk to him about it. I'd often get really upset about these feelings of inadequacy - I felt he'd always leave me for someone better. I never even introduced him to my close friends as I had a deep seated fear he'd leave me for one of them because I believe (and still do) that my friends are so much better than me - prettier, smarter, funnier, more ambitious, taller, slimmer etc... I was terrified of him abandoning me, that my friends would abandon me and live happily ever after together. In the end he did cheat, not with anyone I knew but it still hurt (but was also a relief in some way because I wasn't constantly beating myself up). The thing I'm worried I'm a covert is because throughout this relationship, I had no sense of self, I altered myself to suit him - which sounds horrendous - I desperately tried being like him, making myself desirable to him so he wouldn't leave. I would also give him the cold shoulder if he said something to upset me (I hate to admit this as it's a huge pointer that I'm a covert). This relationship ended last October, and then shortly afterwards I started the beginnings of a relationship with his friend :/// this wasn't intentional at all as this guy and I were only friends (he was also at the tail-end of a toxic relationship so we were mutually helping each other through our rough patches). Then as we started hanging out more as mates only, we got closer, and then bam, the feelings kicked in and we started something new. It was all very promising and for once I didn't feel inadequate and was beyond happy. We both felt guilty for it as we knew it would hurt my ex and ruin the friendship between them. That relationship came to an end unfortunately (April just gone) and since I've felt completely empty and it's making me believe I was only happy because he was essentially my ""supply"". Looking back at that, I worry I only feel ok if I have someone interested in me - almost to fulfil my ego... ugh makes me feel sick thinking that. 

Then with my friends - they are all such beautiful, unique souls - so kind and creative and ambitious. I compare myself to them hugely - and I hate it. Cause I worry it's going to make me resent them. The last couple of months I've isolated myself from seeing them due to the feelings it brings up in me. 

At work I'm so useless and rubbish at my job - I dissociate, I'm so forgetful and scatty and avoidant. So worried of doing something wrong or making a fool of myself. I really struggle to connect to anyone and everyone - I usually just sit in silence because I'm so damn awkward and have no idea what to say and if I do say something it's diverted back at me -which im SO AWARE of, but can't seem to stop - it's like I have nothing else to offer. 

I've been in contact with my doctor about these concerns and literally last week spoke to a mental health nurse where I spilled all my beans, telling her how I believe I've got a personality disorder, specifically covert narcissism - I got really upset but she said she's worked with many patients with personality disorders and said she didn't think I had one/it. But in the back of my head I'm thinking it's because it's covert - it's hard to detect as the person tries to hide it and I believe I've tricked the mental health nurse into thinking there's nothing wrong... i don't know. I've been taking antidepressants since last November and they did help for a while, but now I feel I'm going crazy, so so anxious and the depression has crept it's way back in.

I took the  **The Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale (HSNS)** and scored really high (41) - which terrifies me even more. I've done a couple of other tests/scales and have also scored really high... what the fuck is wrong with me

I'm worried I'm a bad person, like a rotten apple - that I'm soul-less and have no hope of changing. I've done so much research into covert narcissism now that I've freaked myself out completely and believe I have this personality disorder. I hate how I think, hate how I am, hate that I'm so scared - and to know that this personality disorder hurts others makes me want to hide away forever. Knowing that individuals with this disorder can't change makes me think what's the point of going on. I'm a horrible person deep inside. I feel contagious and yucky. 

I'm not trying to label myself as anything, only trying to figure out what's wrong, because I know something is wrong. I'm not right. My thoughts are so fixated on me, but in such a toxic way, obsessed with myself. Always comparing, sizing up, wanting to be better than myself and others at something so I feel that admiration and respect. I don't want to be like this. All these swirling repetitive thoughts that centre around me, and how I come across to people. always wanting to be someone else because I'm so lacking in myself. I don't want to be mean, or empty, or scared or manipulative or grandiose or toxic and harmful. All I want is to be free of this toxic mind. to find peace and to be equal with others. To laugh and connect and have fun - but I don't know how. To feel no competition. To just be. I'm terrified of knowing I'm a covert narcissist because it's so toxic and people sense that and know it's bad - that I'm bad.

I want to change desperately because I can't imagine living and being like this for the rest of my life - I'm only 21, but the thought of being like this for the rest of my life terrifies me. I can't be like this - it's torture.

&#x200B;

I'm so sorry for the essay but there's so much in my head atm and I feel I haven't said enough still - I feel like a fraud because I haven't mentioned everything - but if I did you'd be reading a novel. 

Any advice, thoughts, directions , comfort, etc would be greatly appreciated

Thank you so much for reading and apologies if I repeat or contradict myself - I just needed to get it out",13
230,Going from BPD to NPD?,insurrectionaryINTJ,25,litt01,2021-02-13 05:08:22,33,"Is it possible to go from having BPD to having NPD over a couple of years? I’ve always thought I was just a depressed borderline but since about two years ago, I feel like I stopped relating to it at all. It was like there was a dial inside me slowly amping up my narcissistic traits, which became even more amplified being around others with NPD and being complimented like ten times a day by a variety of people. Like I rarely feel insecure or that intense fear of being abandoned anymore tbh, and if anything, I feel like I’ve become the toxic narc I once feared; e.g. bullying/name calling, treating people like discardable objects, contemptuous behavior, etc. Also, how to know if this is not just narcissistic traits I may have adopted and actually a whole personality disorder. I really need this toxicity to stop taking over my life 😳",25

For example, if I start breaking out, I look bloated, I seemed to have gained weight, my teeth don’t look white enough, etc. This causes problems with me because it starts up jealousy when I see other people who seem to be more put together than me, when it comes to physical appearance. It just makes me think “why is my fiancé with me if there’s people that are better than me?”. It just makes me feel like absolute shit. 

It also takes a toll on my partner because sometimes I compare myself to people he found attractive and it makes me angry or upset that I’m not as good looking as them. This issue also happens if I do or say the wrong thing, I mess up with college coursework, or I just fuck up in some way. I just start to feel like I’m not good enough when things like this happen. I don’t know at all how to cope with this and it really pains me (and I’m sure other people also don’t like it). Does anybody else have this issue? If so, how do you cope?",10
